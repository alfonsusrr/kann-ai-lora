I brought cupcakes! Tsumugi, Touko: Oooh♪ Tsumugi: Oh, yeah. Your cookies and pudding were great! I\'m sure your cupcakes are good too. Meguru: They turned out pretty well, I think. Alright, here you go, Tsumugi-senpai! Tsumugi: Wow♪ Thanks～ Meguru: Togakushi-senpai, here\'s yours! Touko: Ooh♪ This is such a wonderful surprise. Thank you. Nene: Can I try one as well? Meguru: Of course you can! I made a ton of \'em. There\'s no way I\'d leave you out!  Meguru: So here, take one! Nene: Thank you very much. I\'ll have a taste. Shuuji: Oh... Thanks. A girl\'s homemade cupcake, huh... Meguru: I\'m sure you\'ll like it. Shuuji: You\'ve been pretty cheerful lately, I have to say. Meguru: Yeah, thanks to you. Tsumugi: Oh! It\'s great, Meguru-chan! Meguru: Really? I\'m glad you like it! Touko: It\'s so moist and fluffy. You didn\'t just use some pre-packaged mix, right? I can tell you put some real effort into these. The nuts are a great touch. Nene: It\'s really good, Inaba-san. This tastes just as good as the stuff they sell at bakeries.  Meguru: Wow! Nene-senpai, that\'s so nice of you to say! Nene: Sh-Shouldn\'t you sit and eat your own share? Meguru: Oh, well, maybe you should feed me. Just kidding! Nene: ...? What\'s the matter, Inaba-san? Meguru: Oh, nothing! Meguru: Okay, I\'ll eat mine now. Nene: Alright, let\'s call it a day here. Tsumugi: \'Kay! Meguru: Ahaha. You\'re welcome. Shuuji: Welp, time to head home. Meguru: Ah, Senpai, Senpai. Meguru: Are you free after this? Shuuji: I guess, yeah. Meguru: Then, well... let\'s go home together! Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Umm... Is this another cupcake? Meguru: Y-You don\'t want it? Shuuji: Of course I do! I was just surprised. Shuuji: Umm... You went out of your way to make me an extra one? Meguru: ...Well, you\'re the one I made that promise with. Shuuji: Y-Yeah, I guess. Shuuji: Oh... Meguru: I-I\'m the one thanking you, here. Meguru: Come on. Hurry up and eat it. Go, go. Shuuji: Yeah, thanks. I can\'t wait! Shuuji: No, you did good! It\'s just a little messy because I can\'t stop smiling while I eat. Meguru: ...... Shuuji: *munch* *munch* Yeah, it\'s great. This tastes awesome, Inaba-san. Meguru: ...E-Ehehehe. Meguru: Ah! Now you\'re making me smile and laugh too, geez! Shuuji: Huh? How is that my fault? Meguru: \'Cuz what kind of dope smiles while they eat? Meguru: You\'re welcome. Shuuji: Though, to be honest... I wish I had something to drink along with it. It tasted great, but now my mouth is dry. Meguru: Oh... Y-You\'re right! I\'m sorry I didn\'t think of that! Meguru: Umm, there\'s a vending machine down the side street we talked on the other day, right? Let\'s go! Shuuji: Nah, no need to take a detour just for that. I was only half serious, anyway. Meguru: Oh, okay, right... Meguru: Yeah...? Shuuji: I\'ll take that detour after all. Wanna tag along? I wouldn\'t mind chatting more with you. Meguru: Ah... Meguru: Yeah! Of course! Meguru: There we go. Meguru: Hm? What\'s wrong, Senpai? Shuuji: Oh, nothing. Shuuji: For sure. Meguru: That\'s good. I was afraid you wouldn\'t want to eat any of my treats anymore. Shuuji: I\'d never turn down more treats from you. It\'d be awesome if I could have more sometime. Meguru: Roger that. Next time I\'ll make something easier to eat. Meguru: So... What did you want to talk about now?  Shuuji: Hm? Meguru: Don\'t "hm" me! Didn\'t you just say you wanted to chat some more? Shuuji: O-Ohh... Right... Meguru: You want to know? Shuuji: Yeah. After getting this involved, I\'m kinda curious. I haven\'t heard any of the details yet. Meguru: Hmm, let\'s see... Meguru: Nene-senpai kept chatting away about nothing in particular. Shuuji: Oh yeah? Meguru: Other than that, I made dinner to show my thanks for letting me sleep over... Meguru: Oh, right! We also took a bath together! And even better, it was Nene-senpai who invited me for that! Meguru: And before you ask, we didn\'t wash each other or anything. But man, Nene-senpai has such a nice figure and pretty skin. I\'m a girl and was still totally captivated. It\'s not fair how she gets to be both slender and voluptuous. Shuuji: Y-You don\'t say... Meguru: Hey, I know that look! You\'re picturing her right now, aren\'t you?! You perv! Shuuji: You can\'t blame me after you\'re the one who said all that stuff. Shuuji: Erm, I was picturing you this time. Meguru: WHAT?! Wh-Why me?! Meguru: Why would you imagine ME naked?! Compared to Nene-senpai, I\'m basically flat! Shuuji: Well, I think you\'re both really attractive. A flat girl like you can still be hot! Meguru: ―――?! Shuuji: Err, sorry! This has been really rude of me! Forget I said anything! Meguru: W-Will do. I\'ll try my best! You... You see, jokes like that don\'t faze me one bit! Shuuji: Huh? R-Right... Meguru: R-Right! Nene-senpai was worried about whether I\'m getting along with my classmates!  Shuuji: Ahh... Meguru: Y-Yeah. True, we took a bath together, ate cake together and all that... Meguru: ...... Shuuji: ...Inaba-san? Meguru: I\'m sure you\'re curious about that too, huh? Shuuji: Huh? A-About what? Meguru: About why I decided to get a makeover when entering Himematsu. Shuuji: Well... Meguru: Yeah. Our conversation ended up there. Meguru: I didn\'t tell her anything. Shuuji: Huh? Meguru: It\'s a hard subject for me, so I just sorta glossed over it. Shuuji: ...... Meguru: But it makes me wonder if it\'s been weighing on her mind. And if it\'s been weighing on your mind as well... Shuuji: Umm...  Didn\'t you tell us before that you got a makeover to make yourself more approachable? Meguru: I did, and it\'s true, but I\'m talking about what made me want to do that in the first place. Shuuji: O-Oh. Yeah... Meguru: ...... Meguru: Ah... Meguru: O-Okay. It\'s not a very enjoyable story, though... Ahaha... Shuuji: I don\'t mind. I\'m just happy that you\'re willing to tell me. Meguru: ...Thank you. Shuuji: Alright. Go ahead. Meguru: She may have been my only one, but we were really close. We were best friends. Shuuji: ...You didn\'t have any other friends? Meguru: You know how clingy I can be, right? Well, back then, it was even worse. Meguru: I could be myself around Chi-chan, but not any of the other girls... Shuuji: Chi-chan, huh? Meguru: Yeah. Kizuki Chihoko. I always called her Chi-chan. Meguru: She was a very frail and quiet girl. She was a huge bookworm, though, and was super smart. Meguru: I did nothing but read books too, so we had a shared hobby and matching personalities. Meguru: I could tell her all the things that I couldn\'t tell anyone else. I told her everything... Meguru: ...But maybe that was the problem. Meguru: To make things worse, I tend to jabber on incessantly when I get excited. Meguru: Basically, I\'m completely unfettered when it comes to everyone I\'m close with... Shuuji: Yeah, I can see that. Meguru: ...... Meguru: Chi-chan stopped coming to school all of a sudden. Shuuji: Huh? Meguru: I had no idea why. She just stopped coming... Meguru: She never answered my calls or texts either. Meguru: After a while of that, I couldn\'t take it anymore and went over to her place. Meguru: But when I got there... her house was completely vacant. Shuuji: Huh...? Meguru: So I asked our homeroom teacher, but he wouldn\'t tell me anything. All he would say was that she left our school. Meguru: And now... I still have no idea where Chi-chan is or what she\'s currently doing... Shuuji: So... what you\'re saying is that she suddenly moved away and never told you? Meguru: She didn\'t tell me anything. She wouldn\'t even answer my texts or calls. Meguru: But I just figured that it made sense. Shuuji: ...Why\'s that? Meguru: I said something terrible to Chi-chan right before she stopped coming to school. Meguru: "I can\'t get along with anyone else, but you\'re the only friend I want." Meguru: "It\'s the same for you, right? So let\'s be friends forever." Shuuji: What\'s so terrible about that? Meguru: But when I think back on it now, I realize how put off she looked when I said that. Meguru: It was almost like I said something revolting to her... Shuuji: ...... Meguru: That\'s why I figured it must have been my fault that she didn\'t tell me anything. Meguru: Maybe it hurt her when I told her she didn\'t have any other friends than me. Meguru: I would say inconsiderate stuff like that and act like a selfish kid around her all the time. Maybe that was too much for her. Meguru: That must be why she disappeared from my life completely... Shuuji: But... Meguru: Partly because I lost my best friend... Meguru: But also, with Chi-chan gone, I was back to being without a single friend I could open up to. Shuuji: Ah... Meguru: So after that, I just became an introverted bookworm. Meguru: I knew I was too annoying to be good at making friends, so I was too scared to ever try again. Meguru: I also felt like I\'d never get a friendship like Chi-chan\'s again, anyway. Meguru: And besides, not even my best friend Chi-chan wanted to be friends with me anymore. Shuuji: ...I see. Meguru: I decided I couldn\'t let things continue like that. Shuuji: ...... Meguru: I wanted to get good at socializing and tried my best to achieve that. Meguru: So if I were to meet Chi-chan again... I could apologize to her and tell her that I\'m different now. Shuuji: ...And that\'s why you changed yourself when you entered Himematsu. Meguru: Yeah, exactly. Shuuji: I see... Meguru: ...I-I\'m sorry. I just ended up spewing some boring, incomprehensible nonsense! Meguru: L-Let\'s talk about something else! Umm, err, like about MonHun― Shuuji: No. I get exactly how you feel. Shuuji: I\'ve gone through some stuff and struggled to talk to people too. Shuuji: I\'ve always had hardly any friends. The most I could ever muster was some smalltalk with my classmates. I would just wear a fake smile and try not to upset anyone. Shuuji: It got to the point where, just a little while back, my own dad told me I had the eyes of a dead fish. Meguru: Ah... Shuuji: Yeah, you\'ve thought the same, I\'m sure. Meguru: N-No! I would never think anything like that! I just thought you look kinda gloomy. Like you didn\'t have any friends and stuff... Shuuji: Yeah, that doesn\'t make it much better. Meguru: I\'m sorry! Shuuji: It\'s alright. After all, it\'s the truth. Shuuji: But, you see, circumstances led me to joining the OC where I got in touch with everyone else\'s worries. That made me take a closer look at myself, which led to a thought. Meguru: Wh-Which is...? Shuuji: That I couldn\'t let things continue like that. Meguru: ...... Shuuji: I mean, I couldn\'t even muster a decent smile. It was so stiff that even I thought I looked gross. Shuuji: That inspired me to change myself. To give myself a more natural smile... Meguru: ...I see. Meguru: So you\'re... the same as me... Shuuji: Do you understand how I felt? Meguru: Y-Yeah! I totally do! It\'s almost like you were talking about me! Shuuji: Thanks. That is why I feel like I can understand your situation so well.   Shuuji: ...Thanks for telling me. Meguru: D-Don\'t thank me! I should thank you... Meguru: You told me about yourself, listened to my story and understood me. I\'m so happy... Shuuji: Then that makes two of us. Meguru: Seems so... Ahahaha... Shuuji: ...... Meguru: ...... Shuuji: I-I guess it\'s about time we go home. Meguru: R-R-Right, we\'ve been talking all evening... Meguru: Th-This is far enough. Meguru: Yeah. It\'s only a few minutes from here, and the streets are well-lit. Shuuji: Okay. Then I\'ll head home. See you on Monday, Inaba-san. Meguru: Yeah... Meguru: ...Oh, wait a moment! One last thing. Shuuji: Huh? What\'s up? Meguru: Umm... I don\'t know how to put this, but, umm... Meguru: I-I know you think you haven\'t been able to smile well... Shuuji: ...Huh? Meguru: But... Meguru: Your smile has never felt unpleasant to me! Shuuji: ...... Meguru: Y-Yeah... Hehe... Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Ready to have a taste of mine this time? Shuuji: Ahaha, yeah of course you― Meguru: But... Meguru: ...Can I ask for something else instead? Shuuji: What? L-Like, you want me to drink the rest of your cafe au lait or something? Meguru: ...... Shuuji: ...Inaba-san? Meguru: Meguru. Meguru: Could you, from today on... start calling me by my given name? Shuuji: ...... Meguru: ...... Meguru: N-Never mind! I take that back! Forget I said anything! Shuuji: M-Meguru. Meguru: Ah... Shuuji: Is that what you wanted? Meguru: A-Again. One more time. Shuuji: ...Meguru. Meguru: ～～～!! Shuuji: ...Hellooo Meguru. Meguru: That\'s me! Shuuji: Nn... \n\nWhile these examples may provide some guidance, evaluate their relevance to the current conversation.
