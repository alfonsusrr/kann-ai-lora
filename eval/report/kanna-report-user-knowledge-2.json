            "Mikado: Is not about the carbonara, no. I shall leave that matter completely up to you. Kousei: Alright. I'll try preparing a few more dishes next week as an experiment. Maybe up the order limit to twenty-five. Kanna: Sounds good. Anyway, I'm sure you can guess why I've asked you two to stay behind. Mei: This is about my eye again, isn't it? Kanna: We just want to know how things are progressing, so this shouldn't take too much of your time. Has anything changed with your eye since we last spoke? Mei: No. I still don't know how to release my butterflies... Kanna: Not to worry. I'm certain you'll get there eventually. Mikado: Our main purpose in opening this cafe has always been to collect butterflies. Thanks to you, that task has been proceeding expeditiously. Mikado: Allow me to thank you for your hard work once again. We owe you our gratitude. Mei: A-All I'm doing is catching butterflies. I'd wouldn't exactly call that \"hard work\"... Mei: B-But either way, I'll continue to do my best to help! Mikado: Thank you. We appreciate it. Mei: ...... Mikado: But while I appreciate your efforts, I will not be transforming into a cat. Mei: Okay. I'm sorry. Kanna: Allow me to thank you as well, Takamine-san. Kousei: Huh? Why me? Kanna: While it was mere coincidence that brought you here to work with us, you've become an invaluable member of our team. Kanna: Many of our customers even come to our cafe specifically to eat your dishes now. Kanna: So thank you very much. You've been an incredible help to us all. Kousei: Well, I mean... this was all because of that \"problem\" I had with my soul in the first place... Kousei: But I'm glad you appreciate me. Honestly, this job has been pretty fulfilling for me too lately. Mikado: Indeed. It would appear your soul's condition has been greatly improving. Kanna: You can't let your guard down just yet, but as long as you keep heading in the right direction, you won't have anything to worry about. Kousei: Phew. That's a relief to hear. I owe it all to Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Huh? Kousei: Thanks for guiding me in the right direction. Mei: N-No, I didn't do anything. Kousei: You did. Thank you for everything. Mei: I-I... Mei: ...... Mei: U-Um, was there anything else you wanted to discuss? Kanna: No, I believe that's it. Mei: In that case, I've got something I need to do, so--! Mikado: Alright. Then we apologize for keeping you. Mei: That's okay! Anyway, I'll be going now! Kousei: Let me walk you-- Mei: Good night! Kousei: Huh? Kousei: Y-Yeah, I am... Kanna: Good night. Kousei: Yeah. Good night... Kousei: ...... Kousei: I should've known... Mei: Y-You're fine. Kousei: Freaking out? Mei: Y-Yeah... I... Um... Mei: ...... Mei: Oh, gosh... I'm so nervous... Mei: U-Umm... I think it would take too long to explain myself, so... h-here! Mei: Yes. It's... my Valentine's Day gift... to you. Kousei: Chocolate! Mei: Y-Yes. It's chocolate, and it's, um... handmade. Kousei: Handmade! Mei: Wow, you're really excited about this... Suzune-san taught me how to make it, so it should taste alright... I think. Kousei: Oh... Is that why you've been going home together lately? Mei: Yeah. I've been going to her apartment so she could teach me. Mei: She's also been helping me by asking you about your preferences and stuff... Kousei: My preferences? Oh, wait. Mei: Ahaha... Sorry. I guess I just felt kind of embarrassed... Kousei: Is that why the others said they weren't giving me any chocolate this year? So this would be a surprise? Mei: What? I don't know anything about that... Mei: But the others knew I was planning on giving you my own chocolate, so... I guess that could be why they did that... Kousei: Phew. I thought for sure you hated me or something... Mei: Wh-What?! Of course not! Why would you think that? Kousei: I mean, you've been avoiding me lately, haven't you? Mei: I-I wasn't... I mean... Well, maybe a little... Kousei: See? Mei: That's only because I didn't want you to find out I was preparing chocolate for you... Mei: But... I'm sorry for acting so weird. I didn't mean to give you the wrong idea. Kousei: It's alright. I've been really anxious these past few days, so it's a relief to know the truth. Mei: Urk... I'm sorry... Kousei: Handmade chocolate, though... This is more than I expected. Thank you. Mei: Um, if you'd like... you're welcome to go ahead and eat it... Kousei: Right now? Mei: Yeah. I actually brought you a fork too. Kousei: To be honest, I was planning to go home and savor it there... Mei: N-No, please! You can't! You can't keep me waiting that long! Mei: My heart's already pounding so fast it's about to explode! Mei: I need to know how you think it tastes right now... or else I'm going to die! Kousei: A-Alright. I'll have a bite... Mei: Please do! There are two inside, so at least try one of them! Right now! Mei: Something like that. It's called a chocolate fondant. Kousei: Sounds fancy. Was it hard to make? Mei: Not at all. Suzune-san was there to guide me through every single step. Mei: Ah, but just for the record--I made this all by myself! And I think I did a pretty good job! Mei: Though, um... it was a lot crispier on the outside when it came out of the oven, but it might be a bit soggy by now. Mei: But it shouldn't taste bad! This was Suzune-san's own personal recipe! I baked it with the utmost care! Mei: The flavor should be to your liking as well! So p-please, go ahead and try some! Kousei: Alright... don't mind if I do then. Mei: H-Help yourself! Kousei: ...... Mei: H-Hello? Kousei: ...... Mei: Senpai? Kousei: ...... Mei: Um... Does it... taste bad? Kousei: It's delicious. Mei: R-Really? Oh, thank goodness! Kousei: Oh god... It's so delicious... Mei: Wait, what? Huh? Kousei: How? How can something taste THIS good?! Mei: O-Oh, come on... You're exaggerating... Kousei: *sniffle*... Mei: Wait, are you crying? You're not pretending, are you? No way. Like, seriously? You're seriously crying? Kousei: I can't help it... Mei: O-Okay? Kousei: Everyone kept saying they wouldn't be giving me any chocolate... Mei: Oh... right. They said it'd be a hassle to get return gifts for everyone. Kousei: Even Nozomi, who usually gives me chocolates every year... gave me nothing. Mei: Wait, every year? Oh, right. You and Nozomi-chan are childhood friends. Kousei: Yeah, but she said she'd only been giving them to me out of force of habit... Mei: Oh... Err... I'm not sure what to say to that. Kousei: In the end, the only person who gave me chocolates was you... And handmade chocolate too... Kousei: Thank you... Thank you, Hiuchidani-san! Mei: I didn't think you'd be THIS emotional... but I'm glad you like it. Mei: But I can't say I was expecting you to start crying... It's a little, um, creepy. Kousei: Yeah, I know. I guess I tried too hard to sell it. Mei: Ah! I KNEW you were pretending, you stinker! Mei: Do you really mean that? Kousei: Yeah. I mean it. Seriously. Kousei: I could finish off both these chocolates right here if I'm not careful. Mei: Phew... Kousei: There's no way you could've gone wrong with Suzune-san's recipe. Mei: Yeah, but still... Kousei: Besides, even if it DID taste bad, I'd never say it to your face. Mei: What? So it really DOES taste bad?! Kousei: No, no. It's delicious. Really. Mei: *sigh*... My heart's pounding so much. Like, I've been feeling so anxious lately. That's why I've been acting so weird... Mei: When I was making the chocolate by hand, I began to understand how you feel, Senpai. Mei: Making food for someone else to eat is incredibly stressful and nerve-wracking... Mei: But it's also really fun, trying to make something that the person will like. Mei: And when you do get that confirmation from them that they like it... Mei: It makes you happier than words can describe! Kousei: I already told you. Why don't you believe me? Mei: Because I'm worried! Kousei: Didn't you taste it yourself beforehand? Mei: Well, yeah. I tried one I made from the same batch, but still... Kousei: It was delicious, wasn't it? Mei: It was, but this one's gone all cold! It's not FRESH! Kousei: Even so, it tastes delicious. Mei: Really? Really, really? Kousei: If you're really that worried about the taste, why don't you try some yourself? Kousei: See? I told you. Mei: Phew... Wait. Ah... Ahh! Kousei: What? Mei: Th-Th-Th-That was... an i-i-indirect k-ki--! Kousei: Oh, right. Sorry. You're pretty sensitive about these sorts of things, aren't you? Mei: O-O-Oh, no! It doesn't bothe--well... i-it does, I guess... Kousei: My bad. I totally forgot. Mei: I-I mean... As long as it's you, I... Mei: ...... Mei: U-U-Umm! Kousei: Hm? Mei: Suzune-san told me something... Kousei: Yeah? Mei: She said that you'd be happy receiving any kind of chocolate for Valentine's Day... Kousei: It's true. I'm pretty thrilled right now. Thank you, seriously. Mei: You're welcome... But she also said that... if I gave you handmade chocolate... Mei: Then... Umm... Kousei: Hm? Mei: Then you'd... umm! Kousei: Yeah? Mei: You'd think that... it meant I had genuine feelings for you... Kousei: O-Oh, come on! I can't believe she told you that too! Mei: Y-Yes... That's what she said... Kousei: I, er, I mean... I was only half-joking when I said that... Mei: You were... joking? Kousei: Y-Yeah. I was just messing with her... Kousei: B-But don't worry! I'm not dumb enough to think you like me just because of a couple chocolates! Mei: ...... Mei: I wouldn't mind... if you thought I did... though. Kousei: O-Okay? Kousei: ...... Kousei: Wait, what?! Mei: ...... Kousei: ...... Kousei: ...... Mei: Um... Mei: ...... Mei: During our girls' night out the other day... everyone kept asking me about that time we went to the pool together... Mei: Eventually, the conversation turned to... whether or not I had f-feelings for you, Senpai... Mei: I said I didn't know... but everyone else said it was obvious that I did... Mei: I thought they might be right... but I've never had any sort of romantic experience before... so I wasn't sure. Mei: I can't say I really understand my own feelings... but at the very least, I do know that you're a very important person to me. Mei: That's... what I wanted to tell you today. Mei: But... Mei: ...... Mei: Just now, I realized that... I really do... love you, Senpai. Mei: I mean, love is supposed to make your heart pound, isn't it? But when I'm with you, it's almost the opposite... I feel so relaxed that I thought it couldn't be love. Mei: But right now... my heart is pounding like crazy. Even though all I'm doing is telling you how I feel... my chest feels like it's about to burst. Mei: When I made up my mind to give you these chocolates... and when I decided to ask Suzune-san to teach me how to make them... Mei: While I practiced... This morning... During work... And while I was sitting here waiting for you earlier too... Mei: My heart wouldn't stop pounding. Mei: You wouldn't believe how nervous I felt. Mei: The truth is... I've had feelings for you all this time. Mei: So it's time I worked up the courage to say it. Mei: I... I think I love you, Senpai. Mei: No, wait... That doesn't sound right... Mei: ...... Mei: Senpai... I love you. Mei: I love the way you thank me, even when I've barely done anything... Mei: I love the way you're so nice to me, and lend an ear to all my worries... Mei: And I love so many other things about you too. Mei: So please... Mei: ...... Mei: Please... go out with me. Mei: Please... take me as your girlfriend. Mei: I... want to be with you from now on, Senpai. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Right now... my heart's also hammering like crazy. Kousei: When I thought you were avoiding me... it made me feel so lonely and so worried. Kousei: I was afraid you didn't like me, and I became really depressed. Kousei: Especially when you ran off without giving me any chocolate. Kousei: But then--you messaged to ask if we could meet. My heart wouldn't stop pounding on the way here. Kousei: This whole day's been a roller coaster of emotions for me. Kousei: But if what I'm feeling is the same thing you are... then I'm in love too. Kousei: In love with you, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Ah... Urk... Kousei: I love you too, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: S-So... Kousei: I want you to go out with me. Mei: ...... Mei: Ahhh... Mei: I'm a total mess of emotions right now... Kousei: Me too... My face must be burning up right now. Mei: ...... Kousei: ...... Mei: ...... Kousei: Uh... if you don't mind... Mei: Huh? Kousei: Could I call you by your first name? It'd feel oddly formal... if I kept using your last name. Mei: Y-Yeah, I agree... Go ahead. You don't have to use an honorific either... if you don't want. Kousei: Oh... Mei: Yeah. You can just call me Mei. Kousei: M... M-M-M... Mei: You're stammering so much... Kousei: I-I can't help it. I've never called you this before... Mei: That's fine. I can be patient. Kousei: M-Mei... Mei: There you go. Ehehe... Kousei: What about you? Mei: Huh? Kousei: Will you start calling me by my name? Mei: Senpai? Kousei: That's not what it says on my birth certificate. Mei: Urk... Mei: ...... Mei: Kousei... san? Kousei: You can drop the honorific too. Mei: Well... I mean, I'm younger than you, so... Mei: But maybe I could call you Kou-kun instead-- Mei: No, wait. That's even more embarrassing. Kousei: Yeah... That's pretty embarrassing for me too. Mei: Well, for now... I'm only going to use your first name when we're alone together. Kousei: A-Alright. I guess we wouldn't want the others to tease us about it. Mei: E-Exactly. Kousei: ...... Mei: ...... Kousei: Y-Yeah. I mean, if that's okay with you... Mei: O-Of course it is! Mei: ...... Mei: Finally... I'm your girlfriend! "

Mei: Senpai... I love you. Mei: I love the way you thank me, even when I've barely done anything... Mei: I love the way you're so nice to me, and lend an ear to all my worries... Mei: And I love so many other things about you too. Mei: So please... Mei: ...... Mei: Please... go out with me. Mei: Please... take me as your girlfriend. Mei: I... want to be with you from now on, Senpai. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Right now... my heart's also hammering like crazy. Kousei: When I thought you were avoiding me... it made me feel so lonely and so worried. Kousei: I was afraid you didn't like me, and I became really depressed. Kousei: Especially when you ran off without giving me any chocolate. Kousei: But then--you messaged to ask if we could meet. My heart wouldn't stop pounding on the way here. Kousei: This whole day's been a roller coaster of emotions for me. Kousei: But if what I'm feeling is the same thing you are... then I'm in love too. Kousei: In love with you, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Ah... Urk... Kousei: I love you too, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: S-So... Kousei: I want you to go out with me. Mei: ...... Mei: Ahhh... Mei: I'm a total mess of emotions right now... Kousei: Me too... My face must be burning up right now. Mei: ...... Kousei: ...... Mei: ...... Kousei: Uh... if you don't mind... Mei: Huh? Kousei: Could I call you by your first name? It'd feel oddly formal... if I kept using your last name. Mei: Y-Yeah, I agree... Go ahead. You don't have to use an honorific either... if you don't want. Kousei: Oh... Mei: Yeah. You can just call me Mei. Kousei: M... M-M-M... Mei: You're stammering so much... Kousei: I-I can't help it. I've never called you this before... Mei: That's fine. I can be patient. Kousei: M-Mei... Mei: There you go. Ehehe... Kousei: What about you? Mei: Huh? Kousei: Will you start calling me by my name? Mei: Senpai? Kousei: That's not what it says on my birth certificate. Mei: Urk... Mei: ...... Mei: Kousei... san? Kousei: You can drop the honorific too. Mei: Well... I mean, I'm younger than you, so... Mei: But maybe I could call you Kou-kun instead-- Mei: No, wait. That's even more embarrassing. Kousei: Yeah... That's pretty embarrassing for me too. Mei: Well, for now... I'm only going to use your first name when we're alone together. Kousei: A-Alright. I guess we wouldn't want the others to tease us about it. Mei: E-Exactly. Kousei: ...... Mei: ...... Kousei: Y-Yeah. I mean, if that's okay with you... Mei: O-Of course it is! Mei: ...... Mei: Finally... I'm your girlfriend! \n\nWhile these examples may provide some guidance, evaluate their relevance to the current conversation.

            "Mei: Our new cafe, Cafe Stella, will be opening soon! We hope to see you there! Nozomi: If you'd like, please help yourselves to one of our madeleines! Go ahead, they're free! Pedestrian A: Mhh, these are great! Kanna: Thank you very much! Once we open for business, we'll be selling a variety of other cakes and baked good as well, so come check us out, if you're interested! Pedestrian A: Hmm... Natsume: W-We hope to see you there! Pedestrian B: Huh? Oh, um, sure! Natsume: If you'd like, please try one of our free samples too! Pedestrian B: A-Alright... Kousei: Oh, hello. You're, er, that employee from Patisserie Sourian, right? Cake Store Worker: Yes. Cake Store Worker: Not at all. I didn't do anything, really. But, umm, I have to ask. Cake Store Worker: How is Shioyama-san doing? Kousei: She's doing just fine. In fact, she's already found a new job. Kousei: She's the one who baked that madeleine you have. Cake Store Worker: What? So she works at this cafe? Kousei: Yep. We're planning to open next week. Cake Store Worker: Really? I had no idea. Kousei: We'll have other freshly-baked sweets and pancakes on opening day, if you're interested. Cake Store Worker: I may just have to stop by then. But anyway, I'd better get going. Kousei: I hope to see you there next week. Cake Store Worker: Of course. Suzune: They should be cool enough now. Suzune: There we go. Phew, looking good. Very good. Here's your strawberry tartlet. What do you think? Suzune: For the last time... It doesn't LOOK delicious; it IS delicious. Mei: Well, I certainly bet it is, but since I haven't tasted it yet, I can't say for sure, can I? Mei: So having said that, let me have a teensy tiny little bite of-- Nozomi: Hands off, missy. You can have some AFTER we take some pictures. Don't forget; this is for our Instogram. Mei: Ahaha! Sorry! Kousei: Alright, let's do this. Nozomi: I guess they don't pay professional photographers for nothing. The pictures they use on restaurant menus usually look way more appetizing. Suzune: This photo, um, actually makes it looks rather UN-appetizing. Or is that just me? Kousei: No, you're definitely right. Not that I can really say anything, since I'm the one who took it. Kousei: I'll try taking a few more and see if we get a lucky shot. Mei: Wait, Senpai! I have a suggestion. Why don't we try switching locations? Kousei: What would that do? Mei: There's a special trick to taking delicious pictures of food, you see. Mei: Ah--not to say the tart doesn't look delicious as it is, of course. It most certainly does. Suzune: Good save. Mei: Phew... So, as I was saying, some girls in my class taught me this super cool trick when taking food pictures! Kousei: Okay. I'm listening. Mei: Allow me to explain! Mei: From what I'm told, you want to take pictures somewhere with a lot of light. Near a windowsill, for example. Kousei: Oh. Mei: Next, you remove any unnecessary objects. Hands, flowers, whatever--get 'em all out of the shot. Mei: The object should be photographed close up, at an angle. Also, it shouldn't necessarily be dead-center in the image, but a little off to the side. Kousei: Interesting. Nozomi: I tried asking around too, and apparently there are a ton of easy-to-use apps that allow you to enhance photos. Mei: Oh, right! My friends also recommended me some photo-editing apps we could use. Nozomi: The girls in your class are pretty knowledgeable about this stuff, huh? Mei: They all love taking selfies. Mei: Both the really girly girls like you, Nozomi-chan, and even girls that act like sleazy old men. And especially the ones addicted to Instogram. Kousei: Well, either way, I'm glad we have you, Hiuchidani-san. Kousei: Without your guidance, we'd be stuck with these crappy pictures I took. Mei: Well, don't thank me just yet... Ka-chik. Mei: How's that look? Suzune: That's amazing. Just look at how shiny the glaze is. Nozomi: Oh my gosh! Nozomi: Kousei-kun's picture actually looks kind of gross when compared to this. Kousei: I'd have to agree. Mei: I can't believe it either. This turned out way better than I thought it would. Mei: I'll send this pic to my friends and ask them what they think. Kousei: Good idea. Let us know what they say. Mei: Aye, aye. Nozomi: How many followers do we have on Instogram right now, by the way? Mei: Barely any. But, I mean, we've only posted a couple basic announcements. Kousei: Still, it's above zero, isn't it? Nozomi: Yeah. As long as we have some, then we know our flyers worked to some extent. Kousei: I wonder if there's anything we can do to get more followers? Mei: There's no special trick, really. You just gotta put in the effort. Mei: Which means posting tons of pretty pictures, and including all the right hashtags so people can find them. Kousei: Ah, okay. Kousei: So you're saying we'll naturally gain more followers if we keep posting more pics of the cakes Suzune-san bakes for us? Suzune: Don't pin this all on me. Our menu also includes pancakes, omelet rice, pasta, coffee, and tea too, in case you've forgotten. Suzune: In my opinion, we should start by photographing all the items on our menu. Mei: Oh, good idea. Let's do that first. Suzune: So make sure you cook up your best for us, okay? Kousei: I'll try. Nozomi: I know it's important to upload pictures of our food, but don't you think it'd feel a little bland if that's ALL we post? Nozomi: Maybe we could post some casual photos every now and then? Or would that be unprofessional? Kousei: I don't think it's a bad idea. Kousei: Posting a variety of pictures might help us gain more followers. As long as we do it in moderation. Mei: Oh! My friends mentioned that too. Apparently, pictures of cats get a lot of impressions. Kousei: Hmm. Mei: Yeah, I suppose we can't just pick some stray cat off the street. Oh--one of my friends responded! Mei: \"Whoa! That looks delish! I'll definitely come order that once you guys open,\" she says! Mission success! Mei: Oh, there's more! \"Try angling it to the side a bit, and zooming in a little closer.\" Nozomi: Seriously? I thought we already had it pretty close. Mei: I guess we wanna eliminate as much of the unnecessary stuff in the background as possible. Hmm. Like this, maybe? Nozomi: Nice! That's gotta be perfect. Mei: Let's do one more. Suzune: Well, I'll leave you girls to it. Once you're done, feel free to eat the tart. Mei: You don't have to tell us twice! Suzune: You're coming with me, Kousei. We're making pancakes to take pictures of next. Kousei: Yes, ma'am! "

Mei: Hehe. I'll be sure to let my grandma know. Have as many as you want! Suzune: Hey, Kousei! Is it ready yet? I'm already getting full from all these kelp rolls! Kousei: Sorry for the wait. I just finished now. Mei: But you added some kind of smoked ingredient, didn't you? Kousei: You'll see. Go ahead and try it. Suzune: Uh-huh. Mei: ...... Suzune: ...... Mei: Oh? Suzune: Something tastes different. It's a lot more fragrant when I bite into it. Mei: It can't be the bacon, right? Where's this smoky flavor coming from? Suzune: It doesn't seem to be the vegetables, either... What exactly did you do? Kousei: It's the black pepper. That's what I smoked. Mei: Ohh! It's the seasoning! Kousei: Yeah. In a way, black pepper is actually the main ingredient in carbonara. That's where the name of the dish comes from, in fact. Suzune: It's derived from the Italian word for charcoal burner, right? Because there's supposed to be so much pepper on it that it turns black. Kousei: Exactly. I was contemplating whether or not to smoke the salt, but I thought that would change the flavor too much. Kousei: So I decided to smoke the pepper instead. This way it adds a nice kick without destroying the balance of the dish. Suzune: You're right. It really does add a nice kick. It's amazing how a small addition can make such a big difference. Suzune: Even though the seasoning is fundamentally the same, the flavor has a lot more depth. Mei: This is amazing! Just like authentic carbonara! Not that I know what authentic carbonara tastes like, but still! Kousei: Glad you like it. I only just finished smoking the pepper, so the smell might be a little harsh-- Kousei: But as long as I let it sit for a while, it should disappear. Then all I need to do is mix it with some regular black pepper to fine tune the flavor. Suzune: Sounds good. It could use a bit of adjusting, but I definitely think this is good enough to serve to our customers. In all honesty, this really is delicious. Kousei: Thanks. What about you-- Mei: Phew! That was good! Kousei: Wow. Not even a crumb left. Mei: It was too good! Just like real Italian cuisine! Not that I know what real Italian cuisine tastes like, but still! Suzune: You already said that earlier. I get what you're trying to say, though. Kousei: Ahaha... I wasn't expecting this much of a reaction. I'm flattered. Mei: Seriously, it was delicious! You're a genius, Senpai! Kousei: O-Oh stop it... Suzune: Well, since Mei-san is showering you in praise, I'm going to be a little more critical. Suzune: Like you said before, the dish still needs some balancing. Kousei: I know. It's got a pretty strong flavor, so I'm gonna try letting it mellow overnight next time. Suzune: Instead of trying to figure out everything on your own, though, you should ask the others at the cafe to taste-test your dish first. Suzune: Then you can decide if you want to tone it down, or if you actually want to emphasize that distinct flavor. Mei: Ohh, I see! The more unique it tastes, the more likely it is to grab people's interest! Suzune: Exactly. But you might get differing opinions on which one is better, which'll make it harder to decide. Suzune: Still, it's up to you. At the very least, I don't think anyone's going to object to you adding this dish to our menu. Kousei: Alright. I'll give it a shot. Kousei: And thanks, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Huh? Kousei: I wouldn't have come up with this idea without you, so thanks. Mei: Please! All I did was suggest the first thing that came to mind. Mei: Don't underestimate your own genius, Senpai! This really is amazing! Kousei: Th-Thanks. Suzune: Ahem. Kousei: Wh-What? Suzune: We're all out of cheese and sausages, so I'm gonna need you to make me some more. Kousei: You already ate them all? I wanted some too, you know. Suzune: Oh, stop griping. C'mon! Kousei: Alright, alright. Fine. Mei: Senpai! I want to try smoking some other things too! Kousei: Sure. I'll rummage around my fridge and see what else we can toss in the smoker. Mei: This is gonna be great! Kanna: Here's to another great year! Let's all do our best! Suzune: Alrighty. Ready to get back to work? Kousei: Yes, ma'am. Kousei: Not so much changed as added a new twist. I tried smoking the pepper first. Natsume: I can't say it looks or smells particularly different, though... Kousei: You'll see once you try it. Nozomi: Well, I'm gonna go ahead and dig in! Nozomi: That faint hint of smokiness... It's amazing how much difference it makes. Natsume: You said you smoked it yourself? Kousei: Yep. It was all Hiuchidani-san's idea. Mei: Don't be silly. You came up with the idea to smoke the black pepper. Mei: All I did was suggest that we try to make our own bacon. Natsume: Ah. So you spent the break thinking up ways to improve our menu... Natsume: That's very commendable of you. I'm impressed. Kousei: Thanks. How do you think it tastes? Kanna: I, for one, think it's delicious. It gives the dish a lot more added depth. Nozomi: I think so too. This seems like it'd be a real crowd-pleaser. Natsume: It certainly is delicious, but... Kousei: But? Natsume: I feel like the pepper's unique smokiness has a sort of... mature taste to it. Natsume: It's definitely not bad by any means, but--and this is just my personal opinion... Natsume: But I think I actually prefer the regular carbonara. Natsume: So while I'm all for adding this to our menu, I don't think it should replace the original version. Nozomi: You said you added the smoked black pepper to the pasta at the end, right? Kousei: Yeah, I did. Nozomi: In that case, why don't we just serve our regular carbonara with a shaker of smoked black pepper on the side? Nozomi: That way, customers can add as much or as little as they want. Natsume: How would we know how much to prepare in advance, though? Some customers might use a lot more than others. Suzune: A lot of beef bowl restaurants used to do the same thing with their special shichimi spices, but they had to stop the practice a little while back. Suzune: Some customers were using unbelievable amounts of spice, which ended up hurting their profits. Nozomi: Oh... I guess that won't work then. Kanna: It seems like our safest option would be to add this smoked pepper version as a separate item on the menu. Kousei: Alright. So I have all the judges' approval? Kanna: Absolutely. I think this would make a fine addition to our menu. Nozomi: Me too. Natsume: Me three. Kanna: What do you think, Mikado-san? Mikado: I believe Natsume mentioned earlier that this dish had a rather mature taste. However, many of our customers also come here specifically for our coffee and tea. Mikado: Judging from what I have gathered, this would suit their preferences well. Mikado: Therefore, I am in agreement. Kousei: Thank goodness... Mei: Way to go, Senpai! Kousei: Thanks! Kousei: I was just gonna do it at home, actually... Mikado: Among other problems, that would be quite expensive. I would not recommend you do that. Kousei: I guess that's true. Mikado: I do have some other ideas you may wish to consider. Are you free to talk after this? Kousei: Sure. I've got time. Kanna: In that case, let's call it a day here. See you tomorrow, everyone. Natsume: See you tomorrow. Nozomi: See you tomorrow! Kousei: Phew... Kousei: Huh? Hiuchidani-san? Mei: Hey. Kousei: What are you still doing here? Mei: I was waiting for you to finish. Kousei: You could've waited inside. Mei: Ahaha. I didn't want to bother you guys. Mei: Anyway, I know I should've said something earlier... but would you mind walking me home? Kousei: Sure. I don't mind. Let's go. Mei: Thanks! Mei: Congratulations on getting your new recipe approved, by the way. Kousei: Well, you helped with that. Mei: Not at all. You did this on your own, Senpai. Kousei: Nah, it's all thanks to you. I would've never come up with this idea on my own. Kousei: Seriously, thank you. I'm really grateful. Kousei: This might sound kind of melodramatic... but I think I've gained a little more confidence in myself now. Mei: Ehehe... You're gonna make me blush. I don't mean to sound melodramatic either, but, like... Mei: You've done a lot for me as well, Senpai. Ever since you've helped me open up about my left eye, I feel like a huge weight's been lifted off my shoulders. Mei: That's why I wanted to be able to return the favor if I could. Mei: I'm glad I managed to be of some small help to you. Kousei: It wasn't small at all. You were a big help. Kousei: I was hoping to do something like this before I had to deal with my exams, so I'm glad it all went so well. Mei: Oh, your exams are coming up? Kousei: At the end of the month, yeah. Mei: Does that mean you're gonna be working fewer hours? Kousei: No, I'll be working the same as usual. I'll do fine as long as I pay attention in class. Kousei: And I can always study after work too. Mei: You're a pretty diligent student, aren't you? Kousei: I don't know about that... I'm just the sort of guy who hates procrastinating. Mei: That's what it means to be diligent, Senpai. I think that's something to be proud of. Kousei: Nah, trust me... I can be pretty lazy when I want. Mei: But in front of me, at least, you're always hardworking and dependable. Kousei: Okay, sheesh. Stop flattering me. It's gonna go to my head. Mei: Ahaha! Alright. Mei: Well, good night, Senpai. Kousei: Good night. And sorry you had to wait for me earlier. Mei: That's okay. I waited because I wanted to congratulate you. Mei: Anyway, see you tomorrow! Kousei: Yeah. See you tomorrow.

Looks like I'm all out of beer. Mei: Would you like some tea? I haven't drunk directly out of this one yet. Suzune: Sure. By the way, these kelp rolls are delicious. Mei: Hehe. I'll be sure to let my grandma know. Have as many as you want! Suzune: Hey, Kousei! Is it ready yet? I'm already getting full from all these kelp rolls! Kousei: Sorry for the wait. I just finished now. Mei: But you added some kind of smoked ingredient, didn't you? Kousei: You'll see. Go ahead and try it. Suzune: Uh-huh. Mei: ...... Suzune: ...... Mei: Oh? Suzune: Something tastes different. It's a lot more fragrant when I bite into it. Mei: It can't be the bacon, right? Where's this smoky flavor coming from? Suzune: It doesn't seem to be the vegetables, either... What exactly did you do? Kousei: It's the black pepper. That's what I smoked. Mei: Ohh! It's the seasoning! Kousei: Yeah. In a way, black pepper is actually the main ingredient in carbonara. That's where the name of the dish comes from, in fact. Suzune: It's derived from the Italian word for charcoal burner, right? Because there's supposed to be so much pepper on it that it turns black. Kousei: Exactly. I was contemplating whether or not to smoke the salt, but I thought that would change the flavor too much. Kousei: So I decided to smoke the pepper instead. This way it adds a nice kick without destroying the balance of the dish. Suzune: You're right. It really does add a nice kick. It's amazing how a small addition can make such a big difference. Suzune: Even though the seasoning is fundamentally the same, the flavor has a lot more depth. Mei: This is amazing! Just like authentic carbonara! Not that I know what authentic carbonara tastes like, but still! Kousei: Glad you like it. I only just finished smoking the pepper, so the smell might be a little harsh-- Kousei: But as long as I let it sit for a while, it should disappear. Then all I need to do is mix it with some regular black pepper to fine tune the flavor. Suzune: Sounds good. It could use a bit of adjusting, but I definitely think this is good enough to serve to our customers. In all honesty, this really is delicious. Kousei: Thanks. What about you-- Mei: Phew! That was good! Kousei: Wow. Not even a crumb left. Mei: It was too good! Just like real Italian cuisine! Not that I know what real Italian cuisine tastes like, but still! Suzune: You already said that earlier. I get what you're trying to say, though. Kousei: Ahaha... I wasn't expecting this much of a reaction. I'm flattered. Mei: Seriously, it was delicious! You're a genius, Senpai! Kousei: O-Oh stop it... Suzune: Well, since Mei-san is showering you in praise, I'm going to be a little more critical. Suzune: Like you said before, the dish still needs some balancing. Kousei: I know. It's got a pretty strong flavor, so I'm gonna try letting it mellow overnight next time. Suzune: Instead of trying to figure out everything on your own, though, you should ask the others at the cafe to taste-test your dish first. Suzune: Then you can decide if you want to tone it down, or if you actually want to emphasize that distinct flavor. Mei: Ohh, I see! The more unique it tastes, the more likely it is to grab people's interest! Suzune: Exactly. But you might get differing opinions on which one is better, which'll make it harder to decide. Suzune: Still, it's up to you. At the very least, I don't think anyone's going to object to you adding this dish to our menu. Kousei: Alright. I'll give it a shot. Kousei: And thanks, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Huh? Kousei: I wouldn't have come up with this idea without you, so thanks. Mei: Please! All I did was suggest the first thing that came to mind. Mei: Don't underestimate your own genius, Senpai! This really is amazing! Kousei: Th-Thanks. Suzune: Ahem. Kousei: Wh-What? Suzune: We're all out of cheese and sausages, so I'm gonna need you to make me some more. Kousei: You already ate them all? I wanted some too, you know. Suzune: Oh, stop griping. C'mon! Kousei: Alright, alright. Fine. Mei: Senpai! I want to try smoking some other things too! Kousei: Sure. I'll rummage around my fridge and see what else we can toss in the smoker. Mei: This is gonna be great! Kanna: Here's to another great year! Let's all do our best! Suzune: Alrighty. Ready to get back to work? Kousei: Yes, ma'am. Kousei: Not so much changed as added a new twist. I tried smoking the pepper first. Natsume: I can't say it looks or smells particularly different, though... Kousei: You'll see once you try it. Nozomi: Well, I'm gonna go ahead and dig in! Nozomi: That faint hint of smokiness... It's amazing how much difference it makes. Natsume: You said you smoked it yourself? Kousei: Yep. It was all Hiuchidani-san's idea. Mei: Don't be silly. You came up with the idea to smoke the black pepper. Mei: All I did was suggest that we try to make our own bacon. Natsume: Ah. So you spent the break thinking up ways to improve our menu... Natsume: That's very commendable of you. I'm impressed. Kousei: Thanks. How do you think it tastes? Kanna: I, for one, think it's delicious. It gives the dish a lot more added depth. Nozomi: I think so too. This seems like it'd be a real crowd-pleaser. Natsume: It certainly is delicious, but... Kousei: But? Natsume: I feel like the pepper's unique smokiness has a sort of... mature taste to it. Natsume: It's definitely not bad by any means, but--and this is just my personal opinion... Natsume: But I think I actually prefer the regular carbonara. Natsume: So while I'm all for adding this to our menu, I don't think it should replace the original version. Nozomi: You said you added the smoked black pepper to the pasta at the end, right? Kousei: Yeah, I did. Nozomi: In that case, why don't we just serve our regular carbonara with a shaker of smoked black pepper on the side? Nozomi: That way, customers can add as much or as little as they want. Natsume: How would we know how much to prepare in advance, though? Some customers might use a lot more than others. Suzune: A lot of beef bowl restaurants used to do the same thing with their special shichimi spices, but they had to stop the practice a little while back. Suzune: Some customers were using unbelievable amounts of spice, which ended up hurting their profits. Nozomi: Oh... I guess that won't work then. Kanna: It seems like our safest option would be to add this smoked pepper version as a separate item on the menu. Kousei: Alright. So I have all the judges' approval? Kanna: Absolutely. I think this would make a fine addition to our menu. Nozomi: Me too. Natsume: Me three. Kanna: What do you think, Mikado-san? Mikado: I believe Natsume mentioned earlier that this dish had a rather mature taste. However, many of our customers also come here specifically for our coffee and tea. Mikado: Judging from what I have gathered, this would suit their preferences well. Mikado: Therefore, I am in agreement. Kousei: Thank goodness... Mei: Way to go, Senpai! Kousei: Thanks! Kousei: I was just gonna do it at home, actually... Mikado: Among other problems, that would be quite expensive. I would not recommend you do that. Kousei: I guess that's true. Mikado: I do have some other ideas you may wish to consider. Are you free to talk after this? Kousei: Sure. I've got time. Kanna: In that case, let's call it a day here. See you tomorrow, everyone. Natsume: See you tomorrow. Nozomi: See you tomorrow! Kousei: Phew... Kousei: Huh? Hiuchidani-san? Mei: Hey. Kousei: What are you still doing here? Mei: I was waiting for you to finish.

Kousei: Mhhh?! Ahh! Kousei: Crap. I started sucking them again unconsciously. Kousei: Just what is it about nipples that fascinates men so much? Kanna: You make it sound like some sort of philosophical question... Kanna: Gosh. Please don't unconsciously suck on my breasts. What are you, some kind of titty-sucking goblin? Kousei: Your boobs are just too tempting, Kanna. Kanna: That's not a compliment, and I don't appreciate it. Kousei: Wait, wait. I wasn't fooling around with you while you were asleep, I swear. Kousei: I just woke up with your nipples already in my mouth. Kousei: Though, well... I guess I can't deny I might've taken off your clothes while I was still half-asleep... Kanna: *sigh*... It's fine. I'll let you off this time, since I may or may not have been half asleep too. Kousei: What do you mean? Kanna: That's a secret. Kanna: Anyway, it's getting chilly, so I'm pulling my shirt down. Kousei: Aww... Kousei: AHAHA! Perish the thought, m'lady. Kanna: Why do you randomly talk all weird like that? Kousei: Don't worry about it. Anyway, good morning. Kanna: Good morning. Would you like me to make you a cup of coffee again? Kousei: Sure, that'd be great. Actually, why don't I make breakfast? Kousei: I was thinking toast, a fried egg... maybe a salad. That's not too plain, is it? That's all I can really make, to be honest. Kanna: That sounds wonderful. \n\nWhile these examples may provide some guidance, evaluate their relevance to the current conversation.

            "Suzune: Crud. Looks like I'm all out of beer. Mei: Would you like some tea? I haven't drunk directly out of this one yet. Suzune: Sure. By the way, these kelp rolls are delicious. Mei: Hehe. I'll be sure to let my grandma know. Have as many as you want! Suzune: Hey, Kousei! Is it ready yet? I'm already getting full from all these kelp rolls! Kousei: Sorry for the wait. I just finished now. Mei: But you added some kind of smoked ingredient, didn't you? Kousei: You'll see. Go ahead and try it. Suzune: Uh-huh. Mei: ...... Suzune: ...... Mei: Oh? Suzune: Something tastes different. It's a lot more fragrant when I bite into it. Mei: It can't be the bacon, right? Where's this smoky flavor coming from? Suzune: It doesn't seem to be the vegetables, either... What exactly did you do? Kousei: It's the black pepper. That's what I smoked. Mei: Ohh! It's the seasoning! Kousei: Yeah. In a way, black pepper is actually the main ingredient in carbonara. That's where the name of the dish comes from, in fact. Suzune: It's derived from the Italian word for charcoal burner, right? Because there's supposed to be so much pepper on it that it turns black. Kousei: Exactly. I was contemplating whether or not to smoke the salt, but I thought that would change the flavor too much. Kousei: So I decided to smoke the pepper instead. This way it adds a nice kick without destroying the balance of the dish. Suzune: You're right. It really does add a nice kick. It's amazing how a small addition can make such a big difference. Suzune: Even though the seasoning is fundamentally the same, the flavor has a lot more depth. Mei: This is amazing! Just like authentic carbonara! Not that I know what authentic carbonara tastes like, but still! Kousei: Glad you like it. I only just finished smoking the pepper, so the smell might be a little harsh-- Kousei: But as long as I let it sit for a while, it should disappear. Then all I need to do is mix it with some regular black pepper to fine tune the flavor. Suzune: Sounds good. It could use a bit of adjusting, but I definitely think this is good enough to serve to our customers. In all honesty, this really is delicious. Kousei: Thanks. What about you-- Mei: Phew! That was good! Kousei: Wow. Not even a crumb left. Mei: It was too good! Just like real Italian cuisine! Not that I know what real Italian cuisine tastes like, but still! Suzune: You already said that earlier. I get what you're trying to say, though. Kousei: Ahaha... I wasn't expecting this much of a reaction. I'm flattered. Mei: Seriously, it was delicious! You're a genius, Senpai! Kousei: O-Oh stop it... Suzune: Well, since Mei-san is showering you in praise, I'm going to be a little more critical. Suzune: Like you said before, the dish still needs some balancing. Kousei: I know. It's got a pretty strong flavor, so I'm gonna try letting it mellow overnight next time. Suzune: Instead of trying to figure out everything on your own, though, you should ask the others at the cafe to taste-test your dish first. Suzune: Then you can decide if you want to tone it down, or if you actually want to emphasize that distinct flavor. Mei: Ohh, I see! The more unique it tastes, the more likely it is to grab people's interest! Suzune: Exactly. But you might get differing opinions on which one is better, which'll make it harder to decide. Suzune: Still, it's up to you. At the very least, I don't think anyone's going to object to you adding this dish to our menu. Kousei: Alright. I'll give it a shot. Kousei: And thanks, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Huh? Kousei: I wouldn't have come up with this idea without you, so thanks. Mei: Please! All I did was suggest the first thing that came to mind. Mei: Don't underestimate your own genius, Senpai! This really is amazing! Kousei: Th-Thanks. Suzune: Ahem. Kousei: Wh-What? Suzune: We're all out of cheese and sausages, so I'm gonna need you to make me some more. Kousei: You already ate them all? I wanted some too, you know. Suzune: Oh, stop griping. C'mon! Kousei: Alright, alright. Fine. Mei: Senpai! I want to try smoking some other things too! Kousei: Sure. I'll rummage around my fridge and see what else we can toss in the smoker. Mei: This is gonna be great! Kanna: Here's to another great year! Let's all do our best! Suzune: Alrighty. Ready to get back to work? Kousei: Yes, ma'am. Kousei: Not so much changed as added a new twist. I tried smoking the pepper first. Natsume: I can't say it looks or smells particularly different, though... Kousei: You'll see once you try it. Nozomi: Well, I'm gonna go ahead and dig in! Nozomi: That faint hint of smokiness... It's amazing how much difference it makes. Natsume: You said you smoked it yourself? Kousei: Yep. It was all Hiuchidani-san's idea. Mei: Don't be silly. You came up with the idea to smoke the black pepper. Mei: All I did was suggest that we try to make our own bacon. Natsume: Ah. So you spent the break thinking up ways to improve our menu... Natsume: That's very commendable of you. I'm impressed. Kousei: Thanks. How do you think it tastes? Kanna: I, for one, think it's delicious. It gives the dish a lot more added depth. Nozomi: I think so too. This seems like it'd be a real crowd-pleaser. Natsume: It certainly is delicious, but... Kousei: But? Natsume: I feel like the pepper's unique smokiness has a sort of... mature taste to it. Natsume: It's definitely not bad by any means, but--and this is just my personal opinion... Natsume: But I think I actually prefer the regular carbonara. Natsume: So while I'm all for adding this to our menu, I don't think it should replace the original version. Nozomi: You said you added the smoked black pepper to the pasta at the end, right? Kousei: Yeah, I did. Nozomi: In that case, why don't we just serve our regular carbonara with a shaker of smoked black pepper on the side? Nozomi: That way, customers can add as much or as little as they want. Natsume: How would we know how much to prepare in advance, though? Some customers might use a lot more than others. Suzune: A lot of beef bowl restaurants used to do the same thing with their special shichimi spices, but they had to stop the practice a little while back. Suzune: Some customers were using unbelievable amounts of spice, which ended up hurting their profits. Nozomi: Oh... I guess that won't work then. Kanna: It seems like our safest option would be to add this smoked pepper version as a separate item on the menu. Kousei: Alright. So I have all the judges' approval? Kanna: Absolutely. I think this would make a fine addition to our menu. Nozomi: Me too. Natsume: Me three. Kanna: What do you think, Mikado-san? Mikado: I believe Natsume mentioned earlier that this dish had a rather mature taste. However, many of our customers also come here specifically for our coffee and tea. Mikado: Judging from what I have gathered, this would suit their preferences well. Mikado: Therefore, I am in agreement. Kousei: Thank goodness... Mei: Way to go, Senpai! Kousei: Thanks! Kousei: I was just gonna do it at home, actually... Mikado: Among other problems, that would be quite expensive. I would not recommend you do that. Kousei: I guess that's true. Mikado: I do have some other ideas you may wish to consider. Are you free to talk after this? Kousei: Sure. I've got time. Kanna: In that case, let's call it a day here. See you tomorrow, everyone. Natsume: See you tomorrow. Nozomi: See you tomorrow! Kousei: Phew... Kousei: Huh? Hiuchidani-san? Mei: Hey. Kousei: What are you still doing here? Mei: I was waiting for you to finish. Kousei: You could've waited inside. Mei: Ahaha. I didn't want to bother you guys. Mei: Anyway, I know I should've said something earlier... but would you mind walking me home? Kousei: Sure. I don't mind. Let's go. Mei: Thanks! Mei: Congratulations on getting your new recipe approved, by the way. Kousei: Well, you helped with that. Mei: Not at all. You did this on your own, Senpai. Kousei: Nah, it's all thanks to you. I would've never come up with this idea on my own. Kousei: Seriously, thank you. I'm really grateful. Kousei: This might sound kind of melodramatic... but I think I've gained a little more confidence in myself now. Mei: Ehehe... You're gonna make me blush. I don't mean to sound melodramatic either, but, like... Mei: You've done a lot for me as well, Senpai. Ever since you've helped me open up about my left eye, I feel like a huge weight's been lifted off my shoulders. Mei: That's why I wanted to be able to return the favor if I could. Mei: I'm glad I managed to be of some small help to you. Kousei: It wasn't small at all. You were a big help. Kousei: I was hoping to do something like this before I had to deal with my exams, so I'm glad it all went so well. Mei: Oh, your exams are coming up? Kousei: At the end of the month, yeah. Mei: Does that mean you're gonna be working fewer hours? Kousei: No, I'll be working the same as usual. I'll do fine as long as I pay attention in class. Kousei: And I can always study after work too. Mei: You're a pretty diligent student, aren't you? Kousei: I don't know about that... I'm just the sort of guy who hates procrastinating. Mei: That's what it means to be diligent, Senpai. I think that's something to be proud of. Kousei: Nah, trust me... I can be pretty lazy when I want. Mei: But in front of me, at least, you're always hardworking and dependable. Kousei: Okay, sheesh. Stop flattering me. It's gonna go to my head. Mei: Ahaha! Alright. Mei: Well, good night, Senpai. Kousei: Good night. And sorry you had to wait for me earlier. Mei: That's okay. I waited because I wanted to congratulate you. Mei: Anyway, see you tomorrow! Kousei: Yeah. See you tomorrow.

So you spent the break thinking up ways to improve our menu... Natsume: That's very commendable of you. I'm impressed. Kousei: Thanks. How do you think it tastes? Kanna: I, for one, think it's delicious. It gives the dish a lot more added depth. Nozomi: I think so too. This seems like it'd be a real crowd-pleaser. Natsume: It certainly is delicious, but... Kousei: But? Natsume: I feel like the pepper's unique smokiness has a sort of... mature taste to it. Natsume: It's definitely not bad by any means, but--and this is just my personal opinion... Natsume: But I think I actually prefer the regular carbonara. Natsume: So while I'm all for adding this to our menu, I don't think it should replace the original version. Nozomi: You said you added the smoked black pepper to the pasta at the end, right? Kousei: Yeah, I did. Nozomi: In that case, why don't we just serve our regular carbonara with a shaker of smoked black pepper on the side? Nozomi: That way, customers can add as much or as little as they want. Natsume: How would we know how much to prepare in advance, though? Some customers might use a lot more than others. Suzune: A lot of beef bowl restaurants used to do the same thing with their special shichimi spices, but they had to stop the practice a little while back. Suzune: Some customers were using unbelievable amounts of spice, which ended up hurting their profits. Nozomi: Oh... I guess that won't work then. Kanna: It seems like our safest option would be to add this smoked pepper version as a separate item on the menu. Kousei: Alright. So I have all the judges' approval? Kanna: Absolutely. I think this would make a fine addition to our menu. Nozomi: Me too. Natsume: Me three. Kanna: What do you think, Mikado-san? Mikado: I believe Natsume mentioned earlier that this dish had a rather mature taste. However, many of our customers also come here specifically for our coffee and tea. Mikado: Judging from what I have gathered, this would suit their preferences well. Mikado: Therefore, I am in agreement. Kousei: Thank goodness... Mei: Way to go, Senpai! Kousei: Thanks! Kousei: I was just gonna do it at home, actually... Mikado: Among other problems, that would be quite expensive. I would not recommend you do that. Kousei: I guess that's true. Mikado: I do have some other ideas you may wish to consider. Are you free to talk after this? Kousei: Sure. I've got time. Kanna: In that case, let's call it a day here. See you tomorrow, everyone. Natsume: See you tomorrow. Nozomi: See you tomorrow! Kousei: Phew... Kousei: Huh? Hiuchidani-san? Mei: Hey. Kousei: What are you still doing here? Mei: I was waiting for you to finish. Kousei: You could've waited inside. Mei: Ahaha. I didn't want to bother you guys. Mei: Anyway, I know I should've said something earlier... but would you mind walking me home? Kousei: Sure. I don't mind. Let's go. Mei: Thanks! Mei: Congratulations on getting your new recipe approved, by the way. Kousei: Well, you helped with that. Mei: Not at all. You did this on your own, Senpai. Kousei: Nah, it's all thanks to you. I would've never come up with this idea on my own. Kousei: Seriously, thank you. I'm really grateful. Kousei: This might sound kind of melodramatic... but I think I've gained a little more confidence in myself now. Mei: Ehehe... You're gonna make me blush. I don't mean to sound melodramatic either, but, like... Mei: You've done a lot for me as well, Senpai. Ever since you've helped me open up about my left eye, I feel like a huge weight's been lifted off my shoulders. Mei: That's why I wanted to be able to return the favor if I could. Mei: I'm glad I managed to be of some small help to you. Kousei: It wasn't small at all. You were a big help. Kousei: I was hoping to do something like this before I had to deal with my exams, so I'm glad it all went so well. Mei: Oh, your exams are coming up? Kousei: At the end of the month, yeah. Mei: Does that mean you're gonna be working fewer hours? Kousei: No, I'll be working the same as usual. I'll do fine as long as I pay attention in class. Kousei: And I can always study after work too. Mei: You're a pretty diligent student, aren't you? Kousei: I don't know about that... I'm just the sort of guy who hates procrastinating. Mei: That's what it means to be diligent, Senpai. I think that's something to be proud of. Kousei: Nah, trust me... I can be pretty lazy when I want. Mei: But in front of me, at least, you're always hardworking and dependable. Kousei: Okay, sheesh. Stop flattering me. It's gonna go to my head. Mei: Ahaha! Alright. Mei: Well, good night, Senpai. Kousei: Good night. And sorry you had to wait for me earlier. Mei: That's okay. I waited because I wanted to congratulate you. Mei: Anyway, see you tomorrow! Kousei: Yeah. See you tomorrow. Mei: ...... Mei: Hmm... Exams... \n\nWhile these examples may provide some guidance, evaluate their relevance to the current conversation.

Natsume: Kousei and I work at the same cafe. As for what I like about him... Natsume: Well, I enjoy being with him. Despite how he looks, he can also be pretty manly. But I guess I'd say the thing I like most about him is-- Student C: Is? Natsume: Honestly, I'm not sure. Natsume: But I love him a lot. All Three: Ahhh! Female Student B: Ohmigosh, you're SOOO adorable! Student C: You're head over heels for him, aren't you? Female Student A: So does that mean you're the one who asked him out? Natsume: Hmm. It's kind of hard to say. Technically, he's the one who confessed to me. Natsume: But I did kiss him before that. Student C: You kissed before you even started dating? Whoa, girl! Natsume: W-Well, you know. We were watching the sunrise on New Year's, and I got swept up in the moment... Female Student B: Oh, wow. So you two really haven't been going out for long. Student C: So did you guys do the deed outside after that kiss? Natsume: N-No, we didn't! Female Student B: Are you stupid? It's way too cold around this time of year to be having sex outdoors. Female Student A: So you're saying it'd be fine if it were summertime?! Student C: Sorry, Shiki-san! Are we making you uncomfortable? Natsume: No, not particularly... Female Student B: Wait. Are you still a virgin, by any chance? Female Student A: Oh my gosh! Have a little more tact, will you? Natsume: It's fine... Um, I'm not a virgin anymore. All Three: Whoa! Female Student A: You gotta tell us! How was it? Natsume: W-Well, it hurt. Student C: Not surprising. Natsume: But it felt good too. Female Student B: Really? Student C: Your boyfriend--um, Takamine-kun, was it? Has he been with a lot of other girls before you? Natsume: I doubt it. He said it was his first time too. Female Student B: Y'know, when I lost my virginity, I bled like hell. Female Student A: So the blood part is true? Student C: Wait, are you... Female Student A: Urk... Y-Yeah, I'm still a virgin! So what?! Female Student B: Hey, I never said there was anything wrong with that! Better to stay a virgin than to get impatient, throw it away, and end up with a crappy experience. Student C: Yep. You want your first time to be something memorable. Don't you agree, Shiki-san? Natsume: Huh? O-Oh, yeah. It definitely hurt, but it was a really wonderful experience. All Three: Whoa... Natsume: I-I mean, yeah, I agree--you shouldn't just throw away your virginity. Female Student A: A-Alright. I guess I'll just wait for the right guy to come along. Female Student A: Still, I'm kinda scared. Out of curiosity, how bad does it hurt? Female Student B: It's kinda hard to put into words, honestly. It was like an \"Eek!\" if that makes sense. Student C: For me, it was more like... \"Hngh!\" Female Student A: Pretty bad, I take it... Female Student A: What about you, Shiki-san? Natsume: For me, I guess it was only about an \"Ouch!\"... Female Student B: Lucky you. Female Student A: Is there some way to make it hurt less? Natsume: I have no idea. I'm not exactly an expert myself. Student C: Foreplay's probably the most important thing, don't you think? Student C: Then again, some guys have dicks so big it doesn't matter how wet you are. Female Student B: Yeah. Ultimately, it's gonna depend on your partner. Some guys are way too horny and wanna put it in without any foreplay, for example. Female Student A: What should I do if that happens? Student C: Hmm. You could make him cum once, and hopefully that calms him down some. Female Student A: Yeah, but how? Student C: With a handjob or a blowjob. Female Student A: A handjob? Natsume: A blowjob... Student C: You could also go for a thighjob, or an armpitjob--or get creative and go for a hairjob, a footjob, or even a shoulder-blade-job. Female Student B: Sheesh. You've done it all, haven't you? Wait--shoulder blades?! How does that even work?! Student C: What do you mean? You just--wait a minute. Student C: Are you interested in trying out some of this stuff too, Shiki-san? Natsume: Yesn't. Female Student A: What? Was that a yes or a no? Female Student B: Correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like a yes to me! Natsume: Have a good day. Kanna: Good job today, guys. Natsume: Yeah. You too. Suzune: It's been a while now since New Year's, but how are the numbers looking? Kanna: Thankfully, the number of customers hasn't declined in the slightest. Natsume: In fact, we might be getting even more than before, thanks to your Mont Blanc. Suzune: Wow, really? I'm glad all that effort paid off then. Kousei: Must've been a lot of work. Suzune: Well, y'know. It's not easy steaming chestnuts, hollowing them out, then straining them. And you gotta do everything by hand, otherwise the aroma and the texture just won't be the same. Kousei: Should I start coming to work a bit earlier to help out? Suzune: Wow. I thought you hated waking up early. Kousei: I do, but I can deal with it if you need the help. Suzune: Well, I kinda hate to ask you to... Kousei: Why's that? Suzune: You've seem kind of worn out these past few days, if you know what I mean. Kousei: ...... Kousei: I've, uh... been doing a lot of studying. My finals are coming up. Suzune: Well, as someone who lives in the same apartment building, let me give you a bit of advice. You might want to try keeping your voice down while you're \"studying.\" Kousei: ...... Natsume: Don't look at me, idiot. Her room is way too far away from yours; there's no way she'd be able to hear us. Kousei: Ah... Suzune: Hehehe. Well, all jokes aside. Suzune: I appreciate the offer, but I shouldn't be making other employees do extra work. If there's a problem, it's the system that needs to be improved. Kousei: You say that, but you're the one who always ends up doing the brunt of the work, Suzune-san... Suzune: Well, I guess that's just the price I pay for doing things my way. Either way, I shouldn't be pushing the responsibility onto the part-timers. Suzune: You've got exams coming up, don't you? Are you feeling confident about those? I wouldn't want to be responsible for your graduation being pushed back a year. Kousei: Don't worry. Despite what you may think of me, I do take my classes seriously. Natsume: I'm confident enough that I won't need to do any last-minute cramming either. Suzune: Great. Kanna: Still, let us know if you need time off. We'll do our best to handle things here on our own. Natsume: Thanks. I appreciate it. Kousei: So, where to today? Your place, or mine? Natsume: Hmm. Let's go to your place. I want to warm up under your kotatsu. Kousei: Alright. Kousei: I still have some hotpot ingredients leftover from last time too. Natsume: Sounds good. Let's have that. Kousei: Man, they were delicious. Natsume: If I make them, I'll probably end up making a lot, so let's save it for next time, and invite the others over. Kousei: Alright. Kousei: But speaking of which--what ever happened to that qipao you wore during New Year's? Natsume: What is it with you and your cosplay fetish? Kousei: I'm sorry, but you just looked way too cute in it. Kousei: Not to say that you don't normally look cute, because you do. Every day. Natsume: Alright, fine. I'll wear it for you next time, if I'm in the mood. Natsume: Phew. That was good. Kousei: Yep. Natsume: Here, let me clean up. Kousei: Nah, I'll do it today. Natsume: You sure? Well, how about I make us a cup of coffee or tea then? Kousei: Hmm. I could definitely go for a cup of coffee. Kousei: But all I have is the instant stuff. Natsume: Where is it? Kousei: Oh, it's on that shelf up there. The tea's up there too. Only tea bags, though. Natsume: Nope. I'm just waiting for the tea to steep. Kousei: You have to steep tea bags too? Natsume: You don't have to, but the tea's a lot more fragrant this way. Kousei: Huh. Well, I'll be waiting over here. Natsume: Okay. Kousei: Phew. Sure is cold tonight. Kousei: Rokurou-san did seem pretty happy with how things turned out. Natsume: What's that? Kousei: Nothing. Just talking to myself. Natsume: Oh. Well, here's your coffee. Kousei: Sorry I only have tea bags for you. Natsume: I don't really mind. Anyway, scooch over. I need to warm myself up too. Kousei: O-Oh, uh, okay... Kousei: Not much space, though. Natsume: What, do you want me to move? Kousei: I never said that. Kousei: You just don't, err, initiate this sort of... physical intimacy very often. Kousei: It's usually me who does it. Natsume: The only thing you initiate is se... sex, Kousei. Kousei: I won't deny that. But I do like cuddling like this too. Kousei: Especially when you're the one seeking it, Natsume.

Maybe up the order limit to twenty-five. Kanna: Sounds good. Anyway, I'm sure you can guess why I've asked you two to stay behind. Mei: This is about my eye again, isn't it? Kanna: We just want to know how things are progressing, so this shouldn't take too much of your time. Has anything changed with your eye since we last spoke? Mei: No. I still don't know how to release my butterflies... Kanna: Not to worry. I'm certain you'll get there eventually. Mikado: Our main purpose in opening this cafe has always been to collect butterflies. Thanks to you, that task has been proceeding expeditiously. Mikado: Allow me to thank you for your hard work once again. We owe you our gratitude. Mei: A-All I'm doing is catching butterflies. I'd wouldn't exactly call that \"hard work\"... Mei: B-But either way, I'll continue to do my best to help! Mikado: Thank you. We appreciate it. Mei: ...... Mikado: But while I appreciate your efforts, I will not be transforming into a cat. Mei: Okay. I'm sorry. Kanna: Allow me to thank you as well, Takamine-san. Kousei: Huh? Why me? Kanna: While it was mere coincidence that brought you here to work with us, you've become an invaluable member of our team. Kanna: Many of our customers even come to our cafe specifically to eat your dishes now. Kanna: So thank you very much. You've been an incredible help to us all. Kousei: Well, I mean... this was all because of that \"problem\" I had with my soul in the first place... Kousei: But I'm glad you appreciate me. Honestly, this job has been pretty fulfilling for me too lately. Mikado: Indeed. It would appear your soul's condition has been greatly improving. Kanna: You can't let your guard down just yet, but as long as you keep heading in the right direction, you won't have anything to worry about. Kousei: Phew. That's a relief to hear. I owe it all to Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Huh? Kousei: Thanks for guiding me in the right direction. Mei: N-No, I didn't do anything. Kousei: You did. Thank you for everything. Mei: I-I... Mei: ...... Mei: U-Um, was there anything else you wanted to discuss? Kanna: No, I believe that's it. Mei: In that case, I've got something I need to do, so--! Mikado: Alright. Then we apologize for keeping you. Mei: That's okay! Anyway, I'll be going now! Kousei: Let me walk you-- Mei: Good night! Kousei: Huh? Kousei: Y-Yeah, I am... Kanna: Good night. Kousei: Yeah. Good night... Kousei: ...... Kousei: I should've known... Mei: Y-You're fine. Kousei: Freaking out? Mei: Y-Yeah... I... Um... Mei: ...... Mei: Oh, gosh... I'm so nervous... Mei: U-Umm... I think it would take too long to explain myself, so... h-here! Mei: Yes. It's... my Valentine's Day gift... to you. Kousei: Chocolate! Mei: Y-Yes. It's chocolate, and it's, um... handmade. Kousei: Handmade! Mei: Wow, you're really excited about this... Suzune-san taught me how to make it, so it should taste alright... I think. Kousei: Oh... Is that why you've been going home together lately? Mei: Yeah. I've been going to her apartment so she could teach me. Mei: She's also been helping me by asking you about your preferences and stuff... Kousei: My preferences? Oh, wait. Mei: Ahaha... Sorry. I guess I just felt kind of embarrassed... Kousei: Is that why the others said they weren't giving me any chocolate this year? So this would be a surprise? Mei: What? I don't know anything about that... Mei: But the others knew I was planning on giving you my own chocolate, so... I guess that could be why they did that... Kousei: Phew. I thought for sure you hated me or something... Mei: Wh-What?! Of course not! Why would you think that? Kousei: I mean, you've been avoiding me lately, haven't you? Mei: I-I wasn't... I mean... Well, maybe a little... Kousei: See? Mei: That's only because I didn't want you to find out I was preparing chocolate for you... Mei: But... I'm sorry for acting so weird. I didn't mean to give you the wrong idea. Kousei: It's alright. I've been really anxious these past few days, so it's a relief to know the truth. Mei: Urk... I'm sorry... Kousei: Handmade chocolate, though... This is more than I expected. Thank you. Mei: Um, if you'd like... you're welcome to go ahead and eat it... Kousei: Right now? Mei: Yeah. I actually brought you a fork too. Kousei: To be honest, I was planning to go home and savor it there... Mei: N-No, please! You can't! You can't keep me waiting that long! Mei: My heart's already pounding so fast it's about to explode! Mei: I need to know how you think it tastes right now... or else I'm going to die! Kousei: A-Alright. I'll have a bite... Mei: Please do! There are two inside, so at least try one of them! Right now! Mei: Something like that. It's called a chocolate fondant. Kousei: Sounds fancy. Was it hard to make? Mei: Not at all. Suzune-san was there to guide me through every single step. Mei: Ah, but just for the record--I made this all by myself! And I think I did a pretty good job! Mei: Though, um... it was a lot crispier on the outside when it came out of the oven, but it might be a bit soggy by now. Mei: But it shouldn't taste bad! This was Suzune-san's own personal recipe! I baked it with the utmost care! Mei: The flavor should be to your liking as well! So p-please, go ahead and try some! Kousei: Alright... don't mind if I do then. Mei: H-Help yourself! Kousei: ...... Mei: H-Hello? Kousei: ...... Mei: Senpai? Kousei: ...... Mei: Um... Does it... taste bad? Kousei: It's delicious. Mei: R-Really? Oh, thank goodness! Kousei: Oh god... It's so delicious... Mei: Wait, what? Huh? Kousei: How? How can something taste THIS good?! Mei: O-Oh, come on... You're exaggerating... Kousei: *sniffle*... Mei: Wait, are you crying? You're not pretending, are you? No way. Like, seriously? You're seriously crying? Kousei: I can't help it... Mei: O-Okay? Kousei: Everyone kept saying they wouldn't be giving me any chocolate... Mei: Oh... right. They said it'd be a hassle to get return gifts for everyone. Kousei: Even Nozomi, who usually gives me chocolates every year... gave me nothing. Mei: Wait, every year? Oh, right. You and Nozomi-chan are childhood friends. Kousei: Yeah, but she said she'd only been giving them to me out of force of habit... Mei: Oh... Err... I'm not sure what to say to that. Kousei: In the end, the only person who gave me chocolates was you... And handmade chocolate too... Kousei: Thank you... Thank you, Hiuchidani-san! Mei: I didn't think you'd be THIS emotional... but I'm glad you like it. Mei: But I can't say I was expecting you to start crying... It's a little, um, creepy. Kousei: Yeah, I know. I guess I tried too hard to sell it. Mei: Ah! I KNEW you were pretending, you stinker! Mei: Do you really mean that? Kousei: Yeah. I mean it. Seriously. Kousei: I could finish off both these chocolates right here if I'm not careful. Mei: Phew... Kousei: There's no way you could've gone wrong with Suzune-san's recipe. Mei: Yeah, but still... Kousei: Besides, even if it DID taste bad, I'd never say it to your face. Mei: What? So it really DOES taste bad?! Kousei: No, no. It's delicious. Really. Mei: *sigh*... My heart's pounding so much. Like, I've been feeling so anxious lately. That's why I've been acting so weird... Mei: When I was making the chocolate by hand, I began to understand how you feel, Senpai. Mei: Making food for someone else to eat is incredibly stressful and nerve-wracking... Mei: But it's also really fun, trying to make something that the person will like. Mei: And when you do get that confirmation from them that they like it... Mei: It makes you happier than words can describe! Kousei: I already told you. Why don't you believe me? Mei: Because I'm worried! Kousei: Didn't you taste it yourself beforehand? Mei: Well, yeah. I tried one I made from the same batch, but still... Kousei: It was delicious, wasn't it? Mei: It was, but this one's gone all cold! It's not FRESH! Kousei: Even so, it tastes delicious. Mei: Really? Really, really? Kousei: If you're really that worried about the taste, why don't you try some yourself? Kousei: See? I told you. Mei: Phew... Wait. Ah... Ahh! Kousei: What? Mei: Th-Th-Th-That was... an i-i-indirect k-ki--! Kousei: Oh, right. Sorry. You're pretty sensitive about these sorts of things, aren't you? Mei: O-O-Oh, no! It doesn't bothe--well... i-it does, I guess... Kousei: My bad. I totally forgot. Mei: I-I mean... As long as it's you, I... Mei: ...... Mei: U-U-Umm! Kousei: Hm? Mei: Suzune-san told me something... Kousei: Yeah? Mei: She said that you'd be happy receiving any kind of chocolate for Valentine's Day... Kousei: It's true. I'm pretty thrilled right now. Thank you, seriously. Mei: You're welcome... But she also said that... if I gave you handmade chocolate... Mei: Then... Umm... Kousei: Hm? Mei: Then you'd... umm! Kousei: Yeah? Mei: You'd think that... it meant I had genuine feelings for you... Kousei: O-Oh, come on! I can't believe she told you that too! Mei: Y-Yes... That's what she said... Kousei: I, er, I mean... I was only half-joking when I said that... Mei: You were... joking? Kousei: Y-Yeah. I was just messing with her... Kousei: B-But don't worry! I'm not dumb enough to think you like me just because of a couple chocolates! Mei: ...... Mei: I wouldn't mind... if you thought I did... though. Kousei: O-Okay? Kousei: ...... Kousei: Wait, what?! Mei: ...... Kousei: ...... Kousei: ...... Mei: Um... Mei: ...... Mei: During our girls' night out the other day... everyone kept asking me about that time we went to the pool together... Mei: Eventually, the conversation turned to... whether or not I had f-feelings for you, Senpai... Mei: I said I didn't know... but everyone else said it was obvious that I did... Mei: I thought they might be right... but I've never had any sort of romantic experience before... so I wasn't sure. Mei: I can't say I really understand my own feelings... but at the very least, I do know that you're a very important person to me. Mei: That's... what I wanted to tell you today. Mei: But... Mei: ...... Mei: Just now, I realized that... I really do... love you, Senpai. Mei: I mean, love is supposed to make your heart pound, isn't it? But when I'm with you, it's almost the opposite... I feel so relaxed that I thought it couldn't be love. Mei: But right now... my heart is pounding like crazy. Even though all I'm doing is telling you how I feel... my chest feels like it's about to burst. Mei: When I made up my mind to give you these chocolates... and when I decided to ask Suzune-san to teach me how to make them... Mei: While I practiced... This morning... During work... And while I was sitting here waiting for you earlier too... Mei: My heart wouldn't stop pounding. Mei: You wouldn't believe how nervous I felt. Mei: The truth is... I've had feelings for you all this time. Mei: So it's time I worked up the courage to say it. Mei: I... I think I love you, Senpai. Mei: No, wait... That doesn't sound right... Mei: ...... Mei: Senpai... I love you. Mei: I love the way you thank me, even when I've barely done anything... Mei: I love the way you're so nice to me, and lend an ear to all my worries... Mei: And I love so many other things about you too. Mei: So please... Mei: ...... Mei: Please... go out with me. Mei: Please... take me as your girlfriend. Mei: I... want to be with you from now on, Senpai. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Right now... my heart's also hammering like crazy. Kousei: When I thought you were avoiding me... it made me feel so lonely and so worried. Kousei: I was afraid you didn't like me, and I became really depressed. Kousei: Especially when you ran off without giving me any chocolate. Kousei: But then--you messaged to ask if we could meet. My heart wouldn't stop pounding on the way here. Kousei: This whole day's been a roller coaster of emotions for me. Kousei: But if what I'm feeling is the same thing you are... then I'm in love too. Kousei: In love with you, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Ah... Urk... Kousei: I love you too, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: S-So... Kousei: I want you to go out with me. Mei: ...... Mei: Ahhh... Mei: I'm a total mess of emotions right now... Kousei: Me too... My face must be burning up right now. Mei: ...... Kousei: ...... Mei: ...... Kousei: Uh... if you don't mind... Mei: Huh? Kousei: Could I call you by your first name? It'd feel oddly formal... if I kept using your last name. Mei: Y-Yeah, I agree... Go ahead. You don't have to use an honorific either... if you don't want. Kousei: Oh... Mei: Yeah. You can just call me Mei. Kousei: M... M-M-M... Mei: You're stammering so much... Kousei: I-I can't help it. I've never called you this before... Mei: That's fine. I can be patient. Kousei: M-Mei... Mei: There you go. Ehehe... Kousei: What about you? Mei: Huh? Kousei: Will you start calling me by my name? Mei: Senpai? Kousei: That's not what it says on my birth certificate. Mei: Urk... Mei: ...... Mei: Kousei... san? Kousei: You can drop the honorific too. Mei: Well... I mean, I'm younger than you, so... Mei: But maybe I could call you Kou-kun instead-- Mei: No, wait. That's even more embarrassing. Kousei: Yeah... That's pretty embarrassing for me too. Mei: Well, for now... I'm only going to use your first name when we're alone together. Kousei: A-Alright. I guess we wouldn't want the others to tease us about it. Mei: E-Exactly. Kousei: ...... Mei: ...... Kousei: Y-Yeah. I mean, if that's okay with you... Mei: O-Of course it is! Mei: ...... Mei: Finally... I'm your girlfriend! "

My face must be burning up right now. Mei: ...... Kousei: ...... Mei: ...... Kousei: Uh... if you don't mind... Mei: Huh? Kousei: Could I call you by your first name? It'd feel oddly formal... if I kept using your last name. Mei: Y-Yeah, I agree... Go ahead. You don't have to use an honorific either... if you don't want. Kousei: Oh... Mei: Yeah. You can just call me Mei. Kousei: M... M-M-M... Mei: You're stammering so much... Kousei: I-I can't help it. I've never called you this before... Mei: That's fine. I can be patient. Kousei: M-Mei... Mei: There you go. Ehehe... Kousei: What about you? Mei: Huh? Kousei: Will you start calling me by my name? Mei: Senpai? Kousei: That's not what it says on my birth certificate. Mei: Urk... Mei: ...... Mei: Kousei... san? Kousei: You can drop the honorific too. Mei: Well... I mean, I'm younger than you, so... Mei: But maybe I could call you Kou-kun instead-- Mei: No, wait. That's even more embarrassing. Kousei: Yeah... That's pretty embarrassing for me too. Mei: Well, for now... I'm only going to use your first name when we're alone together. Kousei: A-Alright. I guess we wouldn't want the others to tease us about it. Mei: E-Exactly. Kousei: ...... Mei: ...... Kousei: Y-Yeah. I mean, if that's okay with you... Mei: O-Of course it is! Mei: ...... Mei: Finally... I'm your girlfriend! \n\nWhile these examples may provide some guidance, evaluate their relevance to the current conversation.
