Nene: No, I already brought all the ingredients I need. So, would it be alright if I go ahead and start cooking now? Shuuji: Sure, I'll help. Let's make dinner together. That way we can spend more time together.  Nene: Yes, that's true. Shuuji: The bath is ready. You can go in first. Nene: Okay, thank you. "

Nanao: ...It's said that we evolved a sense of taste in order to judge whether something is dangerous or okay to eat. Shuuji: O-Okay? Nanao: However, humans have no need for that anymore. Instead, they only use it for enjoying the taste of food. Nanao: People living in this day and age never even think about the original purpose of their taste buds anymore. Shuuji: ......

Well then, let your big sis here lend you an ear. Touko: Talking to someone might help you sort out your thoughts, no matter who it is. Shuuji: ...Thank you. Touko: It makes sense that you'd be worried about the hole in your heart, given that you were born with that magic of yours. Shuuji: Right... I mean, I still don't really understand much about it. Touko: Yeah, and it's not like you got it because you wanted it. Shuuji: ...But it's true that my ability is what allowed me to start dating Meguru, so I don't hate it anymore. Touko: That's good. There's no point in hating it, so that's for the best. Shuuji: Right. I realize that my ability is a part of who I am, and Meguru loves me along with it. Touko: Ohh, what an awesome thing to say. You looked really cool there. Shuuji: Thank you... But, how do I put it... Touko: Hm? Shuuji: Meguru seems desperate to fill the hole in my heart... which only makes me feel worse about the situation. Touko: Say, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Yeah...? Touko: Magic is granted to people with wishes they want fulfilled, yeah? Shuuji: That's what I've heard. I don't know what Ayachi-san and Shiiba-san's wishes are, though. Touko: I see. But... Touko: ...What about your magic? Shuuji: Huh? Touko: Well, you have magic too, right? Shuuji: Yeah, but I just inherited it from my mom. Touko: But from what I've heard, your magic is similar but different. Shuuji: Well... Yeah... Touko: So I'm wondering why you have it. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: ...... Touko: Hm? Shuuji: Thank you. Touko: Don't thank me. I was just thinking aloud a little. Shuuji: Still. Shuuji: Meguru, sorry! Meguru: What?! Meguru: Umm, what is it...? Shuuji: I have to go now. There's somewhere I gotta go today. Meguru: O-Okay... Meguru: A-Alright then, Senpai. Umm... See you tomorrow! Shuuji: Yeah, see you tomorrow. Meguru: ...... Shuuji: Hello. Thanks again for the help a while back. I'm wondering, can you spare another moment for me? Nanao: Hmm... Okay. I'll close the cafe. Shuuji: Huh? Nanao: You've come here looking for help with something, right? Have a seat here and wait a moment. Shuuji: ...Thank you. Shuuji: ...What do you think, Souma-san? Nanao: I figured you might come to me with those questions one day... Which is why I've given them a lot of thought myself. Shuuji: I'd really appreciate it. Nanao: A witch may be gathering other people's heart fragments, but those are just the ingredients. The magic is formed according to the contractor's own wish and feelings. Nanao: So yes, it exists to fulfill their wish. Nanao: And like I told you before, there is no doubt that the ability you possess is magical in nature. Shuuji: ...But it's not like I got this ability because I was trying to fulfill some wish. Shuuji: ...Right. Nanao: And since it's magic, it also has a purpose that goes along with it. Nanao: Both you and your mother should have different purposes. Nanao: Your magic and hers are similar, but not the same. You possess your own magic. Shuuji: Which means my ability must have some kind of purpose... Shuuji: But, still― Nanao: I have a question I'd like to ask you first. Shuuji: Ah, s-sure. Nanao: Correct me if I'm wrong, but is it possible that you've been sensing the emotions of everyone other than Meguru less lately? Shuuji: Um... Yeah. I have been. Nanao: So then... Nanao: Doesn't that mean that a degree of directionality or selectivity has developed for your ability? Nanao: Basically, it's becoming possible for you to control it. Shuuji: ...... Nanao: How you absorbed the Meguru's fragments a while back is another example. Nanao: You were present for several other occasions where fragments were collected, but that was the only time you absorbed them during the collection process. Nanao: Don't you think the reason for that lies within you? Not that you did this intentionally, of course. Shuuji: So I've become able to control my ability... Nanao: ...Your magic is an extremely unusual case. Nanao: But nonetheless, it is still magic. So what this all comes down to is... Nanao: What is it you really wish for? The answer to that question is the key to everything. Shuuji: What I wish for... Nanao: Maybe your heart is waiting for you to find the answer to that question. Nanao: Maybe you're subconsciously aware that such an answer exists. Shuuji: ...... Nanao: Have a sip of coffee. Shuuji: ...Yeah, good idea. Nanao: Glad to hear that. Nanao: ...It's said that we evolved a sense of taste in order to judge whether something is dangerous or okay to eat. Shuuji: O-Okay? Nanao: However, humans have no need for that anymore. Instead, they only use it for enjoying the taste of food. Nanao: People living in this day and age never even think about the original purpose of their taste buds anymore. Shuuji: ...... Nanao: But that purpose is clear and immutable. Nanao: You have it to protect your very life. "

Shuuji: That just means she isn't very used to playing games in general. It's better not to overdo it in the beginning. Meguru: True. But, Nene-senpai, does this club not have much to do or something? It's been like this every day lately. Nene: It is not like we get a people coming in asking for help every day. There are a lot of slow days too. But once someone does come, a whole bunch usually follow. Shuuji: Oh, yeah? Is that so? Meguru: That's surprising. With who's running the club, I figured you'd have a full house every day. Nene: It used to be like that in the beginning, but then I figured that all the casual visitors would drive the ones with more serious issues away. Meguru: Ahh, got it. That's why I haven't been seeing anyone stopping by for fun. Shuuji: By the way, Inaba-san. Meguru: Yeah? Shuuji: How's it going in your class? I mean, you're here all the time these days. Meguru: Hmm, not bad... I guess. I found some girls who play MonHun with me, like I said. Meguru: But things would get annoying if I stood out too much. Besides, spending time with Nene-senpai is so fun! Nene: ...... Meguru: Ah! But I definitely feel more comfortable there than before. Really, thanks for what you did for me. Shuuji: That's great. Meguru: I decided to handle the rest myself. So far, so good. Shuuji: On that note, do any of your friends in class have any worries or problems? Meguru: Huh? Let me think... Hmm... Shuuji: No one comes to mind? Like, no one who looks really depressed lately or anything? Shuuji: I figured there'd be some with romantic concerns or something. Is there not any talk like that going around? Meguru: Well, some girls are like that, but... that can actually be a pretty touchy subject among girls. Shuuji: Because it's embarrassing? Meguru: There's that, but when girls discuss love-related stuff with other girls, they're doing it to keep each other in check. There are some mind games at play, so they pick and choose when to talk. Nene: To... keep them in check? Meguru: Yeah. When they say \"I'm in love with A-kun,\" what they're really saying is \"I've called dibs on A-kun, so you girls keep your hands off him, alright?\" Nene: That's what they mean when they say that? I had no idea... Shuuji: Is it first come, first served or what? Meguru: Things can get ugly for you if you don't catch all the hidden meanings behind what other girls say. Meguru: Like, you'd get into serious trouble even if A-kun confessed to you on his own. Shuuji: I don't see how you could be to blame for someone confessing to you... And it doesn't matter how the one being confessed to feels? Meguru: That's just how it is. It's an ironclad rule among girls. Especially for those from the same cliques. Shuuji: How can you talk about this so casually? I don't know if I could deal with having to follow such an absurd rule.  Shuuji: I dunno. I guess it depends... At least, I feel like when guys bring up that kind of thing, it's to ask for advice and not to keep each other in check. Shuuji: So, what if you have girls like Ayachi-san who all sorts of students consult? Girls who go to her genuinely want advice, right? Meguru: Nene-senpai, are you often asked \"Who do you have a crush on?\" before someone consults you? Nene: Now that you've mentioned it, I do get that question a lot. Shuuji: And how do you answer? Nene: Truthfully. There is no one like that. Meguru: Which means they always confirm if Nene-senpai is a potential rival before consulting her. Shuuji: Huh. Interesting. Shuuji: What if she happened to have a crush on the same person? Meguru: \"Ohh, I see. What now? I have a crush on him too... But I don't stand a chance against you, do I?\" Meguru: Like that, she would look pitiful and corner Nene-senpai into saying something like \"That's not true. You should fight for him.\" And so Nene-senpai would end up rooting for her. Meguru: The point of all that would be to mark her territory and say \"Stay away,\" no questions asked. Shuuji: Holy crap... That's intense. Meguru: So yeah, that's why girls tend not to consult each other on romance. Shuuji: Uh, you do realize that you're a girl too, right? Meguru: Hmm... But come to think of it, I feel like Kawakami-kun looked kinda down... Shuuji: Is that a classmate of yours? Meguru: Yeah. He's one of the boys from my class. He was looking pretty depressed, when he's usually laughing and goofing off with his friends.  Meguru: Okay! He might still be in the classroom. I'll go and check. Nene: Ah, but... Won't that be a bother to you? Meguru: Not at all. Am I... being annoying? Nene: No, absolutely not. If Kawakami-kun really is worried about something, then I would like to help him. Meguru: Then I'll go and look for him. You've helped me, so I want to repay the favor. Please let me help, if you don't mind. Nene: Inaba-san... Thank you. Please help us out, then. Meguru: Yeah! Okay, I'll be on my way! Kawakami?: Hey, what's the deal, Inaba?! Why'd you drag me here...? Meguru: You've got something worrying you, right? Something you can't figure out? We want to help you. Really. This isn't a prank or anything. Kawakami?: Yeah, but... Meguru: Nene-senpai! I brought him over! Nene: Thank you, Inaba-san. Meguru: Hehehe～ I'm glad you're happy. Nene: Thank you, but...

Shuuji: Oh, sorry. We were kinda in our own world there. Tsumugi: It's okay, don't worry. I'm completely used to that by now. Meguru: That just makes it more embarrassing! This is all your fault, Senpai! Shuuji: Yeah, okay. It's always my fault. Nene: It is great to see that you two are as close as ever. Nene: But I don't know how to feel about you two resolving everyone's problems by yourselves... Tsumugi: I know, right? There's nothing for us to do. Nene: Yeah. I feel kind of left out. Nene: But I don't think the two of us can keep up with those two. Tsumugi: Yeah, no kidding. Hoshina-kun and Meguru-chan are both super good at picking up on everyone's worries and feelings. Nene: Yes. It's unbelievable when you think about how they were just a year ago. Shuuji: Were we really that dense in your eyes? Meguru: You had your ability, so I wouldn't say you were outright dense. I think she's talking about how you were kinda out of touch with some things? Meguru: Right, Nene-senpai? It's hard to believe how this guy used to be, huh? Tsumugi: Err, you know you're in the same boat, right? Meguru: No way! You were talking about me too?! I thought I was really good at picking up on things! Nene: In your case, you were either too considerate or not at all. You were either on or off, with nothing in the middle. Meguru: Ugh... Y-Yeah, that sounds about right... Now I'm depressed. Tsumugi: B-But that's not the case anymore, so don't worry about it! You two are now the stars of the club! Tsumugi: How did you two become so good at this, anyway? Meguru: Well... I dunno. How did we? I just sorta became able to pick up on things better... Shuuji: Well, Meguru and I were both really bad at socializing in general. Shuuji: But now that I have Meguru, I can look back on my past self more objectively... That's probably helping a lot. Nene: I see. Maybe you're right. Tsumugi: Oh, so it's thanks to your relationship with Meguru-chan? Meguru: Senpai... Shuuji: Hahaha. Well, maybe that's just how I want to see it. Meguru: No, I think so too! I also wanna see that way too! Meguru: Nene-senpai, Tsumugi-senpaai! Hoshina-senpai loves me as much as ever♪ Nene: Mmph. I-I can't breathe, Inaba-san... Tsumugi: Ahaha, at least that hasn't changed about her... Except for the added boyfriend brag. Shuuji: Yeah, that's my Meguru, alright. Tsumugi: Right. \"Your\" Meguru-chan. Shuuji: Well, it just seemed like the right thing to say here. Tsumugi: Right, right. Togakushi-senpai would've loved it if she heard that. Tsumugi: I'm gonna text her and tell her you said that later today. Shuuji: No, please don't! Nene: I would appreciate it if you could help with that again. Meguru: Sure! It's for you two, after all. Meguru: I got her number, so she'll probably come if I contact her. Shuuji: Cool. Maybe you should ask her to bring along the friend she made up with too. Meguru: Yeah. The other girl was worried too, so she should also have fragments to get now that they've made up. Tsumugi: ...You talked to her friend too? Shuuji: Yeah. There are always at least two sides to these kinds of situations, so we went to see the other girl too. Meguru: Anyway, I think there's gonna be fragments for the both of you this time. Tsumugi: You really have thought of everything! Nene: Thank you very much. Alright, then... Tsumugi: Now! Tsumugi: Nice, got 'em all♪ Meguru: Ooh! Great job, Tsumugi-senpai, Nene-senpai! Nene: Inaba-san, no one else can see us right now... Meguru: Oh, right! If someone saw me, they'd think I'm some crazy girl shouting at nothing. Nene: Yes. Hence, I would like you to remain as stoic as possible, like Hoshina-kun. Meguru: Come to think of it, you've been pretty quiet, Senpai... Shuuji: Oh, uh... yeah. Shuuji: I was just thinking how it's strange that I can still see them when they're in witch form, even though I don't have my magic anymore. Nene: Perhaps that's because the results of your magic are still lingering. Nene: You may have lost your ability to use magic once your wish came true, but Inaba-san still has your crystallized feelings. Shuuji: I see. So that's why I can still see you. And Meguru can see you because she has the product of my magic. Nene: P-Please don't look at me too much... It's embarrassing, plus I feel bad for Inaba-san... Meguru: Hey, isn't it about time we get back? We just talked about how it would be bad if anyone else saw us! Shuuji: Oh, whoops. Okay, let's head back to the clubroom. Shuuji: Um, are you upset about something? Meguru: You were looking at Nene-senpai and Tsumugi-senpai back when they retrieved those fragments, weren't you? Shuuji: Obviously. They were right there in front of us. Meguru: You were gawking at them... Especially Nene-senpai with her ridiculously sexy outfit! You couldn't be more of a super perv if you tried. Shuuji: Why are you only mad about this now?! Meguru: So, can you tell me that their outfits didn't even slightly turn you on? Shuuji: ...No, I can't. Meguru: Thought not. Shuuji: What do you expect?! Anyone would stare at such a revealing outfit! Meguru: I. Don't. Care. Shuuji: Look... I'm seriously sorry. Please cheer up, Meguru! Meguru: No can do. I'm jealous. Meguru: Take this♪ Shuuji: ...What? Meguru: I'm jealous, so now I'll win you back by doing this♪  Shuuji: Oh, you were only playing around? Phew. Don't scare me... Meguru: Well, I didn't know for sure! I can't tell whether you're speaking the truth when you use words alone. Meguru: So I gotta do this instead. Shuuji: ...And what is this telling you? Meguru: That you really are thinking I'm the only girl for you, right? Shuuji: Actually, I was thinking, \"Man, Meguru's boobs sure are small.\" Meguru: So you really were checking out their boobs! You're such a creep. You'll never change, will you? Meguru: Now I'll never let go of you! Shuuji: Yeah, please don't. You'll stop by my place today, right? Meguru: Of course! Gotta keep our promise to always stay together♪ Meguru: So, Senpai, was that true? Am I really the only girl for you? Shuuji: Do I really need to spell it out? Meguru: I want to hear it from you. It'd make me happy if you said it clearly. Shuuji: ...You will forever and always be the only girl for me. No one else could ever compare to you. Meguru: Heh, hehehe... Meguru: ...Thanks. You're also the only one for me... Ehehe... Rub, rub♪ "

Shuuji: Well, we still have 10 minutes before it's time. She shouldn't be too long... Kawakami: Honestly, I expected you to be dead last, Inaba. Meguru: Mgh. Judging people on appearances is a little rude, you know.  Shuuji: Nah, you're not late or anything. Don't worry about it.  Nene: Sorry... It took me a bit of time to get myself ready... Shuuji: Oh, I see. But hey, the outfit looks great on you. Super cute, Nene. Nene: Th-Thank you... Hehehe. Kawakami: ...Is the difference really that noticeable? I mean, sure, she looks cute like she always does, but I dunno... Meguru: What are you saying? The difference is HUGE. Her hair ends are trimmed, and her cuticles also look perfect. I'd totally bet she's been to a beauty salon.  Kawakami: You serious...? I can't see squat. Heck, like, is it even possible to tell differences in something like trimmed hair ends? Meguru: Actually, popular guys notice these things.  Kawakami: Oh... No wonder Hoshina-senpai did. It's crazy that he's so attentive to detail. Meguru: Hmm... I don't know about that. In his case, I feel like it isn't visual awareness that led to it, but a little thing called \"situational\" awareness.  Shuuji: ...... Meguru: But you better keep in mind, complimenting for the sake of complimenting is a no-no. Kawakami: Ah, okay. Interesting.  Shuuji: ...... Nene: Yes. Kawakami: So where're you gonna be going? Shuuji: Hmm... I like the arcade. Meguru: An arcade for the first place? Very interesting choice. Kawakami: Umm, according to what I've read, arcades aren't a good spot to go on a date... Shuuji: That's just in general. With everything, it really just depends on you and your partner, and your tastes and interests.  Nene: I quite like arcades myself. I've never actually been to one proper, though, so I'm fairly excited for this.  Meguru: Whoa, really?  Nene: I have entered one before, but we were short on time then, so all we did was go to the photo booth. Kawakami: Ohh, okay... Kawakami: So it's the same with dates as it is with shaggin'! Can't go by the books! Shuuji: Yes, but PLEASE don't say that out loud, for Christ's sake!! Meguru: Shaggin? What does that mean? Kawakami: Nah, it's nothing! Just forget I said that, Inaba. Meguru: Hmm. Something smells veeery fishy.  Shuuji: Come on, we're going.  Kawakami: Ah, we're gonna tail you guys from a short distance.  Nene: Oh, you are? I was under the impression we would all stay together... Meguru: Oh no, that'd make things way too awkward for you two.  Kawakami: I wanna know how couples act naturally, is all. If we constantly interrupted y'all with comments and whatnot, that'd pretty much defeat the purpose. Kawakami: Just forget about us two and do your thing. Go on, go on. Shuuji: It's kind of hard to do that when we know we're being watched... Shuuji: No point in dawdling around here forever. Let's go, Nene. Nene: Yes, I'm ready.  Shuuji: If you want, sure. Do you like them? Nene: I do like them, yes... But more so, I thought it would be nice to have some sort of physical object to remember our dates by.  Nene: Do you remember how you suggested we get a cork board before?  Shuuji: So that's what you want... Shuuji: Alright, then! In that case, I'm gonna get you a plushie as a present today. Nene: A plushie? Shuuji: Yep. One from those claw machines. And we can even include it in the picture we take! Nene: Oh, that's a fantastic idea. I'd love that. If you can get one, that'd be wonderful. Shuuji: Almost there, almost there... And, now! Nene: Please don't drop it, please don't drop it... Shuuji: I guess there has to be a way... "

Nene: Whatever the case, try not to feel so useless. Nene: There's no doubt all the fragments we've gotten back so far are thanks to the, umm... p-power of your love. Meguru: Ah... Nene-senpaaai! Touko: Lost in thought, huh? Shuuji: Ah... Hey there, Togakushi-senpai. Touko: Can't bear to face Inaba-san? Shuuji: No, that's not it... Touko: Alrighty. Well then, let your big sis here lend you an ear. Touko: Talking to someone might help you sort out your thoughts, no matter who it is. Shuuji: ...Thank you. Touko: It makes sense that you'd be worried about the hole in your heart, given that you were born with that magic of yours. Shuuji: Right... I mean, I still don't really understand much about it. Touko: Yeah, and it's not like you got it because you wanted it. Shuuji: ...But it's true that my ability is what allowed me to start dating Meguru, so I don't hate it anymore. Touko: That's good. There's no point in hating it, so that's for the best. Shuuji: Right. I realize that my ability is a part of who I am, and Meguru loves me along with it. Touko: Ohh, what an awesome thing to say. You looked really cool there. Shuuji: Thank you... But, how do I put it... Touko: Hm? Shuuji: Meguru seems desperate to fill the hole in my heart... which only makes me feel worse about the situation. Touko: Say, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Yeah...? Touko: Magic is granted to people with wishes they want fulfilled, yeah? Shuuji: That's what I've heard. I don't know what Ayachi-san and Shiiba-san's wishes are, though. Touko: I see. But... Touko: ...What about your magic? Shuuji: Huh? Touko: Well, you have magic too, right? Shuuji: Yeah, but I just inherited it from my mom. Touko: But from what I've heard, your magic is similar but different. Shuuji: Well... Yeah... Touko: So I'm wondering why you have it. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: ...... Touko: Hm? Shuuji: Thank you. Touko: Don't thank me. I was just thinking aloud a little. Shuuji: Still. Shuuji: Meguru, sorry! Meguru: What?! Meguru: Umm, what is it...? Shuuji: I have to go now. There's somewhere I gotta go today. Meguru: O-Okay... Meguru: A-Alright then, Senpai. Umm... See you tomorrow! Shuuji: Yeah, see you tomorrow. Meguru: ...... Shuuji: Hello. Thanks again for the help a while back. I'm wondering, can you spare another moment for me? Nanao: Hmm... Okay. I'll close the cafe. Shuuji: Huh? Nanao: You've come here looking for help with something, right? Have a seat here and wait a moment. Shuuji: ...Thank you. Shuuji: ...What do you think, Souma-san? Nanao: I figured you might come to me with those questions one day... Which is why I've given them a lot of thought myself. Shuuji: I'd really appreciate it. Nanao: A witch may be gathering other people's heart fragments, but those are just the ingredients. The magic is formed according to the contractor's own wish and feelings. Nanao: So yes, it exists to fulfill their wish. Nanao: And like I told you before, there is no doubt that the ability you possess is magical in nature. Shuuji: ...But it's not like I got this ability because I was trying to fulfill some wish. Shuuji: ...Right. Nanao: And since it's magic, it also has a purpose that goes along with it. Nanao: Both you and your mother should have different purposes. Nanao: Your magic and hers are similar, but not the same. You possess your own magic. Shuuji: Which means my ability must have some kind of purpose... Shuuji: But, still― Nanao: I have a question I'd like to ask you first. Shuuji: Ah, s-sure. Nanao: Correct me if I'm wrong, but is it possible that you've been sensing the emotions of everyone other than Meguru less lately? Shuuji: Um... Yeah. I have been. Nanao: So then... Nanao: Doesn't that mean that a degree of directionality or selectivity has developed for your ability? Nanao: Basically, it's becoming possible for you to control it. Shuuji: ...... Nanao: How you absorbed the Meguru's fragments a while back is another example. Nanao: You were present for several other occasions where fragments were collected, but that was the only time you absorbed them during the collection process. Nanao: Don't you think the reason for that lies within you? Not that you did this intentionally, of course. Shuuji: So I've become able to control my ability... Nanao: ...Your magic is an extremely unusual case. Nanao: But nonetheless, it is still magic. So what this all comes down to is... Nanao: What is it you really wish for? The answer to that question is the key to everything. Shuuji: What I wish for... Nanao: Maybe your heart is waiting for you to find the answer to that question. Nanao: Maybe you're subconsciously aware that such an answer exists. Shuuji: ...... Nanao: Have a sip of coffee. Shuuji: ...Yeah, good idea. Nanao: Glad to hear that. Nanao: ...It's said that we evolved a sense of taste in order to judge whether something is dangerous or okay to eat. Shuuji: O-Okay? Nanao: However, humans have no need for that anymore. Instead, they only use it for enjoying the taste of food. Nanao: People living in this day and age never even think about the original purpose of their taste buds anymore. Shuuji: ...... Nanao: But that purpose is clear and immutable. Nanao: You have it to protect your very life. "

            "Shuuji: Then let's do that. Time is precious, so let's spend it together.  Nene: Yes, I don't want to have to be apart from you anymore... I love you, I love you so much... I don't want to live a single day without you! Shuuji: I love you too. Nene: A little... Nene: But right now... I'd prefer that. Shuuji: Are you a masochist or what?  Nene: I could be. Maybe I want you to tie me up. So hug me tight... Don't let go. Shuuji: Maybe today is just different. My heart's so full of love and happiness right now. It feels so much warmer than usual.  Nene: As is mine. Here, see for yourself... Do you feel it? Shuuji: Yeah. I can feel your body so keenly... You're really soft. Nene: Hey, now's not the time for sexual remarks. Also... I don't like the sound of that. It's like you're saying I'm flabby... Shuuji: Sorry, Nene. Nene: More importantly, you haven't properly answered my question. Can you sense my feelings right now? Shuuji: Yeah, I can. I can feel your warmth and love so much... It's making my chest heat up like a furnace.  Nene: I just feel so safe and secure when you hold me like this. I've been alone this whole time... and I was scared. So, so scared... I haven't even been able to sleep properly as of late.  Nene: But tonight I think I'll be able to get a good night's sleep... If I'm not careful, I might not even be able to wait until we get back to the apartment... Shuuji: Is that, um... an invitation? Nene: An invitation for... what? Shuuji: Well, you know... Don't make me spell it out. Nene: Wait... EEK?! N-N-N-N-No, what are you thinking?! I wasn't suggesting we... have sex outside before going back... Get your mind straight! Shuuji: I'll admit I was talking about sex, but I WASN'T talking about doing it outside! Sheesh! Nene: Ah... urk... ughhh... Nene: Look, I wasn't getting at that or whatever you're thinking! I-I really am just sleepy! Shuuji: O-Oh, okay... Nene: We're going to do something tomorrow that... requires energy? Huh? Wait? D-Don't tell me... Y-You want to have tons of rough sex...? Shuuji: What? I was just thinking we could on a date or something... Nene: O-Oh... right. Nene: Ah――!! Wh-Why is my mind so dirty right now... This is so embarrassing... Shuuji: So... what do you want? We can go on a normal date, or we can go to your place and have tons of rough sex. If you want the latter, I can do that. Nene: N-No thank you. The former will do! Shuuji: ...Okay. Shuuji: Not that I mind... But we are in public. Are you okay with people seeing us? Nene: Well... ugh... urgghhhh... That would be embarrassing... But I don't want to move from this place right now. That's more important. Nene: I'm willing to put up with other people seeing if it means I can feel this warmth. So please keep holding me. Hug me as tight as you can.  Shuuji: ...Okay. "

            "Wakana: If you're just normal friends and nothing more, then you shouldn't do it. That about sums it up. Shuuji: I see. That's good to know. Wakana: Okay. It's about time for me to head home too. Shuuji: Sorry I dragged you along with me. And thanks. Wakana: You're welcome. Okay then, good luck. Shuuji: See ya. Nene: The sun is starting to set. What does Kawakami-kun's schedule say from here on? Shuuji: Nothing special. They'll eat dinner together somewhere, then he'll see her home. Meguru: And where does he plan on eating? Shuuji: He put down a somewhat fancy place. Let's see... Ah, this one. Look, it's this one in the pamphlet.  Nene: This restaurant, huh... Meguru: It looks pretty expensive. Shuuji: I don't think the prices will be that outrageous, but yeah, it doesn't seem cheap. I guess he wants to make their first date something special. Meguru: I get that, but this might be going too far... Nene: Maeda-san would get nervous and worry about the price if it's too expensive. Shuuji: Yeah, but he'll be covering the bill, won't he? Meguru: But then she'll feel like she's mooching off of him. I don't think Maeda-san would be happy with that. Shuuji: I see. Nene: Wouldn't somewhere you can relax be better? A place more fitting for students. Meguru: I know how Kawakami-kun feels, but yeah... I think she'd accept an average-tasting dinner if it means she can have a good time with him, yeah? Shuuji: Hmm... You have a point. What about ramen, then? Meguru: No. Ramen is a clear no-go. Nene: As a girl, I'm sure she'll dress up for her first date, so she would be worried about the broth spatters. Food with a strong smell is also bad for the same reason. Shuuji: Then what about... a Raizeriya? The food is good, it's cheap, and it's got a pretty casual atmosphere. Meguru: Sure, the food is good there and it's fitting for students. But going to a cheap chain restaurant on the first date...? Well, I'm sure Maeda-san would be okay with that. Nene: It might be Kawakami-kun who has a problem with that, since he planned out this date so meticulously. Shuuji: True... He's a guy, after all. He has his pride. Meguru: I guess Kawakami-kun can keep his choice as a last resort, but he should play it safe and ask her where she'd like to go first. Meguru: After all, what you feel like eating depends on your mood. Nene: I agree. Shuuji: But then he'd get the old \"Anything goes,\" swiftly followed up by \"Really? THAT place?\" once you suggest something. Meguru: That's a pretty jaded outlook on women. I don't think Maeda-san would embarrass her date like that. Nene: And wouldn't a conversation about food preferences help liven things up? Meguru: You know it, Nene-senpai! Getting to know each other more like that is a nice thing. Nene: I believe the best way would be to discuss where to go together, with Kawakami-kun's choice being presented as an option. Shuuji: While we're at it, what are your thoughts on the whole date plan itself? Meguru: Hmm... It's okay, but it does feel like he's going for a little too much. Meguru: Things like going to the movies and window shopping are good and all, but it might be a little tiring with the lack of breaks. Nene: If he wants to go see that movie, it might be a good idea to relax in a cafe afterwards. Shuuji: I see. Nene: Apart from that, how about making sure he watches Maeda-san carefully? Shuuji: What do you mean? Nene: There's a lot to watch out for, such as not walking too fast. Her feet might start hurting depending on what shoes she wears. Meguru: On that note, you're walking too fast, Senpai. That's not good. Shuuji: Whoops... I wasn't thinking about that at all. Meguru: That kind of casual kindness makes girls pretty happy. Shuuji: I'll watch out for that from now on. Shuuji: Okay. I'll put all of our advice together in a text... Something like this, I guess? Meguru: Are you done? Shuuji: Yep. I also made sure to double-check it. Nothing important was left out. Nene: Well then, what shall we do now? Go home? Meguru: Huh?! Go home?! I thought we were having dinner together, so I told my parents not to make me anything! Nene: Then I don't mind going somewhere to eat. Are you coming along, Hoshina-kun? Shuuji: I don't see why not. It would beat making something for myself at home. Meguru: Do you make your own dinners? Shuuji: Yeah. All the household tasks are my job. My mother passed away a while ago, so it's just me and my dad. Meguru: Oh. Umm... Shuuji: Don't worry, I don't mind talking about it. I actually really hate it when people get awkward about it. Meguru: O-Okay. Roger that. Shuuji: Eating out is alright on your end, Ayachi-san? Nene: Yes. I live by myself, so there won't be a problem. Meguru: You live by yourself? That's pretty cool! Nene: Really? I personally don't think it's anything that great. Shuuji: Yeah, I imagine the downsides outweigh the upsides. Shuuji: Sure, but what should we eat? Nene: I'm fine with anything. There's nothing I dislike. Shuuji: What are you in the mood for, though? Anything you've been craving? Meguru: Oh, I know! Give me a \"shi\"! Give me a \"su\"! It's \"shisu\"! Shuuji: How old are you, again? Are you my grandmother? Who says it like that these days? Meguru: Hey, I'm a lovely young maiden! My stuffed animals tell me so every night! Shuuji: ...You still talk to your stuffed animals? Meguru: Huh? Oh... I kinda talk to my stuffed animals sometimes when I'm alone. I've been trying to drop the habit, but it's hard to do so... Meguru: Is that weird? Meguru: Ugh... I figured. I want to get rid of that habit. I've been trying hard to drop it, but... old habits die hard, I guess. Shuuji: Well, I'm sure you can if you keep trying. Meguru: Right! Yeah, I'll give it my best! Shuuji: What's the problem? You don't have to stop if you don't want to. Meguru: Really? Shuuji: Just maybe don't go around advertising the fact. Shuuji: Though, I'm totally cool with it. Meguru: Thank you for saying so. Shuuji: So, should we go with Inaba-san's request, then? Nene: Umm... Can you eat \"sheaths\"? Isn't that the stuff that covers cables? I don't know of any food like that... Shuuji: Huh?! How did you get to \"sheath\"?! It's \"shisu\"! Nene: Huh? It's not sheath? Then, am I the only one who doesn't know what this \"shisu\" is? Meguru: I wouldn't say that... It's something people used to say decades ago. \"Shisu\" is basically... Meguru: Man, having to explain your joke like this is really embarrassing. Shuuji: It'll be easier to just go and show her. Let's head to a shisu place. Looks like Ayachi-san is interested enough. Nene: Oh, I see. \"Shisu\" is a transposition cipher of \"sushi.\" Now it all makes sense. Meguru: T-Transposition cipher? S-Senpai, what the heck is that? Now I feel like the stupid one. Shuuji: Huh? It's a form of encryption where characters or group of characters are shifted. Meguru: Another critical hit?! I'm the only stupid one here?! Shuuji: Ayachi-san, are you okay with sushi? Conveyor belt sushi, even. Nene: Yes, I'm okay with this. I'm looking forward to it, actually. I've never been to a sushi restaurant like this before. Meguru: Oh, really? Nene: I almost never eat out. I'm getting rather excited! Nene: Is that so? Wow, amazing... Meguru: That's a big fat lie. Stop trying to trick her into embarrassing herself, Senpai. Shuuji: I didn't actually expect her to believe me... Sorry. Nene: No, it's okay. More importantly, look at it go round and round... Ah, there's even pudding! Shuuji: Do you visit these kinds of sushi places often, Inaba-san? Meguru: Not on my own, but sometimes with my family. It's actually a lot rarer for me to go to normal sushi restaurants. What about you? Shuuji: ...Now that I think about it, I guess I hardly ever eat out either. Especially since my dad often works weekends. Though, it's not like it's my first time at a place like this. Nene: By the way, umm, what is this faucet-like thing? Meguru: Oh, well, these kinds of sushi places are self-serve, so― Shuuji: Hey, you ever hear the joke about how you're supposed to wash your hands with that faucet before eating? Nene: Is that so? That's very convenient. Meguru: Hey! Don't! You'll get burned! Stop misleading her, Senpai! You're filling this poor novice's head full of lies! Shuuji: Sorry, Ayachi-san. That was a nasty joke. That is a hot water dispenser for tea. You can find teabags inside the box there. Be careful; it's hot. Nene: Oh, so it's for tea. I would have fallen for that if you hadn't told me. Shuuji: Yeah, it is... Gotta say, you look like you're having a blast. Nene: To be honest, I've always wanted to go to a conveyor belt sushi restaurant once. I could never muster the courage to go by myself. Meguru: True, going to this kind of place alone is hard. Well, I'm glad we came here if you're enjoying it. Nene: I got a tuna! You two aren't going to take anything? Meguru: Ah, excuse me! Some flounder, please! Nene: ......? Shuuji: Ah, I'll take some sea bream and albacore roe. Clerk: Flounder, sea bream and albacore roe, alright. Thank you very much! Nene: ―――, ......, ―――, ...... Nene: Umm, Hoshina-kun, Inaba-san. Aren't you supposed to take your sushi from the conveyor belt? Meguru: Generally, yeah. But these days a lot of restaurants accept direct orders. Shuuji: Yeah, some places even have menus. Nene: ...Oh, I see. "

Meguru: ...You seem surprisingly normal. Shuuji: What's that supposed to mean? Meguru: Well, with the concert coming up, I was pretty sure you'd be a nervous wreck right about now. Shuuji: I'm pretty damn nervous. There's still a lot of time, though, so it hasn't really sunk in yet. Shuuji: Plus, there's a bunch of stuff I have to help with first. Meguru: The guys are making jack-o'-lanterns, right? Shuuji: Yup, we'll be carving pumpkins till the cows come home. Meguru: It's great that you're motivated, but please be careful. It'd be awful if you cut your fingers or something. Shuuji: Of course I will. Shuuji: So, what're we gonna do with the pumpkin guts? It'll be a bit of a waste to throw it all away. Meguru: We're gonna make cookies and pudding and stuff to have as snacks for the partygoers. Shuuji: Really? Pumpkin cookies and pudding, huh? Sounds tasty. Meguru: I'll give you a taste of mine if the concert is a success. Shuuji: Huh? Are you making them too? Meguru: Didn't anyone ever tell you not to judge a book by its cover?! I'll have you know I'm totally awesome at making snacks! Shuuji: ...... Meguru: Hey! You don't believe me, do you?! You don't believe me at all! Shuuji: No, I do. Meguru: Liar! You totally don't. Fine, then. I'll just have to prove it. Meguru: You better make sure the concert is a success so you get to eat my hand-cooked snacks! Promise me! Shuuji: This just adds to the pressure, really... Shuuji: But I'll do as best I can. Meguru: Then I'll do the best I can to make you something delicious! Meguru: Yeah, looks good. It suits you to a T. Nene: Really? Great. Meguru: What about me? Am I wearing this properly? Nene: Yes. It's very cute. Meguru: Thank you very much. Ehehe. Tsumugi: *sigh* So lucky... I wish I could wear cute clothes too. Shuuji: Was a costume too much for you, Shiiba-san? Tsumugi: Yeah, unfortunately... The outfit the Fashion Design Club made was so cute and girly! I just loved it! Tsumugi: But because of that... I couldn't handle it. Shuuji: I-I see... Shuuji: Well, don't let it get you down. You'll be able to wear whatever you want once you collect enough fragments. It won't be that long now. Tsumugi: Yeah, thanks. Touko: Hey, what about me? Am I wearing this properly? You can't see anything you shouldn't, can you? Shuuji: ...Y-You're fine. Everything important is covered up... I think. That's a pretty wild costume. Touko: Even I'm a little embarrassed wearing this. But I have to since the Fashion Design Club went through all the trouble of making it for me. Shuuji: ...Is our Fashion Design Club full of guys or something? Touko: No. It doesn't have any boys; only girls. Shuuji: I see... There sure is a lot on display for clothing made by girls... Tsumugi: Well, Togakushi-senpai has a great figure. Anyone with some fashion sense would want to make her costume revealing to accentuate her figure. Shuuji: Is that how it works? Meguru: 'Kaaay! Nene: Ah, don't you have to set things up for your band, Hoshina-kun? You can go ahead. Just leave this to us. Tsumugi: Good luck with the show! Shuuji: Thanks. Wakana: Huh? You've already changed, Hoshina? Should I go and change too? Shuuji: Nah, this is just a simple cloak that's easy to get on and off. You can change after we're done setting up. Wakana: 'Kay. Hideaki: I'd like to set up the drums now. Is it cool if I go in there? Shuuji: Yeah, should be fine. Ayachi-san and the others are already in there. Go do what you need to. Hideaki: Gotcha. Wakana: Well then... Guess we should do a final rehearsal? Shuuji: Yeah. Shuuji: How're you feeling? Is that cold gone yet? Wakana: Yeah, I'm fine. What about you? Shuuji: Never felt better. Wakana: Then let's do this! Shuuji: Yeah! Nene: Right, it's about time. Shuuji: Y-Yeah... Meguru: Your voice is kinda shaky. You okay? Shuuji: Y-Yeah, I'm fine. I can do this. Just gotta do it like I did in practice. Hideaki: Though, repeating what you did in practice is never easy in an actual live show. Wakana: Kaidou! What're you trying to make him nervous for?! Hideaki: I didn't mean to... I'm just wondering, is he really gonna be okay getting up on stage like this? Tsumugi: Hoshina-kun, you're looking a little pale. Touko: Are you sure you're okay? Shuuji: I'm fine. Totally fine. There's no running away from this now. I'm always ready for action when push comes to shove! Hideaki: That macho nonsense is fine if it helps calm your nerves... but you do realize your fly's down, right? Shuuji: What?! Whoa, since when?! How long has it been open for?! Shuuji: Shut up! And next time you notice someone's fly is down, let them know more discretely! Hideaki: My bad. I just noticed as I was talking. Shuuji: Man... Tsumugi: ...He looks nervous. Touko: I don't think I've ever seen Hoshina-kun this shaken up before. Meguru: W-Well, it's better than him suddenly realizing how nervous he is on stage. Nene: ...It's almost time for the show to start. We don't really have any time to help you calm down... Shuuji: I'm fine. I can do this. Wakana: ...... Touko: Ah, it's about time I made the starting announcement. Shuuji: Yeah, please do. I doubt giving me more time will help me relax. If anything, I'll probably feel much better once I'm on stage. Touko: ...Really? Okay then. Hideaki: Alright, guys. Let's try to have fun out there. If we look like we're enjoying ourselves, then the audience will enjoy themselves too. I say this from experience. Shuuji: ...Alright, let's go! Hideaki: That's the spirit! Wakana: Let's do this. Hideaki: Man, it's been forever since I was last on stage! Shuuji: Kariya... Wakana: You've practiced so hard to get here. You even kept at it after hurting your fingers. Wakana: You did great in practice, so you'll be fine here too. You've got this. Shuuji: ...... Wakana: If you lose your way on stage, then just calm down and listen to what I'm playing. Let that guide you. Wakana: Don't let the anxiety crush you, and enjoy the show. Wakana: This is your first time on stage, and it might be your last. Even if you mess up, you don't want to walk away from this with regrets. So give it all you have. Shuuji: Yeah. I don't have to do everything perfectly. All that matters is that the crowd enjoys themselves. Wakana: Right. So let's have fun out there! You and me, together. Shuuji: ...Yeah. Let's enjoy this. Shuuji: Yeah! Touko: Next up, we have a performance from our volunteer band. Is everything ready? Then the stage is all yours! Wakana: We're going to play a song for you all to kick this party into high gear. Wakana: We formed our band in a rush just for this occasion, so we can only play one song. Wakana: But we're going to pour our hearts and souls into that one song, so we hope you all enjoy it! "

Tsumugi: I think he got away with around half of them, but at least we managed to protect these. Tsumugi: See, Akagi? Doesn't it hurt to have your own heart taken from you? Tsumugi: Isn't it just awful? Tsumugi: So I don't want you doing the same thing... even if you need more fragments. Tsumugi: I'll be sure to work harder. Just don't do it, okay? Akagi: *sniff* *sob*! Akagi: I thought I was doing the right thing, but I wasn't at all... Shuuji: ...Akagi? Akagi: It was the most important promise to me! Akagi: And yet... I've let other things become more important than it. Akagi: Enough to make our promise grow hazy in my memory... Akagi: So... So when the boy told me I was still nowhere near human, it stung. Shuuji: Huh? Akagi: It's already been fifty years. I should have been faster! Akagi: I should have fulfilled my dearest promise in that time, but I strayed off course. Akagi: I tried to go back to my usual single-minded ways, but failed... Is it because I'm so far from being human that I couldn't? Akagi: It... It was the thing most precious to me... So why did I...?! Akagi: I'm worthless. As an alp, and as a human. Shuuji: I'm sorry, Akagi. I was mistaken. Shuuji: We always try to go back to our usual selves as well. Shuuji: You're already plenty human. Akagi: Shuuji... Tsumugi: I think so too, Akagi. Akagi: Tsumugi... Thank you. Thank you to the both of you. Akagi: And thank you for protecting a part of my promise. Nanao: I couldn't match him in a footrace. Nene: I see. That's a problem. Nene: He has probably realized that we're after him now. Nanao: I imagine he'll change his den now that he knows Akagi found it. Nene: It will be much harder to track him down now. Tsumugi: Shuuji-kun? Shuuji: There's a way for us to find him. "

            "Tsumugi: So maybe Hoshina-kun's subconscious is reluctant to let go of them. That might be why I'm not getting any back. Meguru: Yeah... Sorry for kinda making you comfort me... Nene: Whatever the case, try not to feel so useless. Nene: There's no doubt all the fragments we've gotten back so far are thanks to the, umm... p-power of your love. Meguru: Ah... Nene-senpaaai! Touko: Lost in thought, huh? Shuuji: Ah... Hey there, Togakushi-senpai. Touko: Can't bear to face Inaba-san? Shuuji: No, that's not it... Touko: Alrighty. Well then, let your big sis here lend you an ear. Touko: Talking to someone might help you sort out your thoughts, no matter who it is. Shuuji: ...Thank you. Touko: It makes sense that you'd be worried about the hole in your heart, given that you were born with that magic of yours. Shuuji: Right... I mean, I still don't really understand much about it. Touko: Yeah, and it's not like you got it because you wanted it. Shuuji: ...But it's true that my ability is what allowed me to start dating Meguru, so I don't hate it anymore. Touko: That's good. There's no point in hating it, so that's for the best. Shuuji: Right. I realize that my ability is a part of who I am, and Meguru loves me along with it. Touko: Ohh, what an awesome thing to say. You looked really cool there. Shuuji: Thank you... But, how do I put it... Touko: Hm? Shuuji: Meguru seems desperate to fill the hole in my heart... which only makes me feel worse about the situation. Touko: Say, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Yeah...? Touko: Magic is granted to people with wishes they want fulfilled, yeah? Shuuji: That's what I've heard. I don't know what Ayachi-san and Shiiba-san's wishes are, though. Touko: I see. But... Touko: ...What about your magic? Shuuji: Huh? Touko: Well, you have magic too, right? Shuuji: Yeah, but I just inherited it from my mom. Touko: But from what I've heard, your magic is similar but different. Shuuji: Well... Yeah... Touko: So I'm wondering why you have it. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: ...... Touko: Hm? Shuuji: Thank you. Touko: Don't thank me. I was just thinking aloud a little. Shuuji: Still. Shuuji: Meguru, sorry! Meguru: What?! Meguru: Umm, what is it...? Shuuji: I have to go now. There's somewhere I gotta go today. Meguru: O-Okay... Meguru: A-Alright then, Senpai. Umm... See you tomorrow! Shuuji: Yeah, see you tomorrow. Meguru: ...... Shuuji: Hello. Thanks again for the help a while back. I'm wondering, can you spare another moment for me? Nanao: Hmm... Okay. I'll close the cafe. Shuuji: Huh? Nanao: You've come here looking for help with something, right? Have a seat here and wait a moment. Shuuji: ...Thank you. Shuuji: ...What do you think, Souma-san? Nanao: I figured you might come to me with those questions one day... Which is why I've given them a lot of thought myself. Shuuji: I'd really appreciate it. Nanao: A witch may be gathering other people's heart fragments, but those are just the ingredients. The magic is formed according to the contractor's own wish and feelings. Nanao: So yes, it exists to fulfill their wish. Nanao: And like I told you before, there is no doubt that the ability you possess is magical in nature. Shuuji: ...But it's not like I got this ability because I was trying to fulfill some wish. Shuuji: ...Right. Nanao: And since it's magic, it also has a purpose that goes along with it. Nanao: Both you and your mother should have different purposes. Nanao: Your magic and hers are similar, but not the same. You possess your own magic. Shuuji: Which means my ability must have some kind of purpose... Shuuji: But, still― Nanao: I have a question I'd like to ask you first. Shuuji: Ah, s-sure. Nanao: Correct me if I'm wrong, but is it possible that you've been sensing the emotions of everyone other than Meguru less lately? Shuuji: Um... Yeah. I have been. Nanao: So then... Nanao: Doesn't that mean that a degree of directionality or selectivity has developed for your ability? Nanao: Basically, it's becoming possible for you to control it. Shuuji: ...... Nanao: How you absorbed the Meguru's fragments a while back is another example. Nanao: You were present for several other occasions where fragments were collected, but that was the only time you absorbed them during the collection process. Nanao: Don't you think the reason for that lies within you? Not that you did this intentionally, of course. Shuuji: So I've become able to control my ability... Nanao: ...Your magic is an extremely unusual case. Nanao: But nonetheless, it is still magic. So what this all comes down to is... Nanao: What is it you really wish for? The answer to that question is the key to everything. Shuuji: What I wish for... Nanao: Maybe your heart is waiting for you to find the answer to that question. Nanao: Maybe you're subconsciously aware that such an answer exists. Shuuji: ...... Nanao: Have a sip of coffee. Shuuji: ...Yeah, good idea. Nanao: Glad to hear that. Nanao: ...It's said that we evolved a sense of taste in order to judge whether something is dangerous or okay to eat. Shuuji: O-Okay? Nanao: However, humans have no need for that anymore. Instead, they only use it for enjoying the taste of food. Nanao: People living in this day and age never even think about the original purpose of their taste buds anymore. Shuuji: ...... Nanao: But that purpose is clear and immutable. Nanao: You have it to protect your very life. "
