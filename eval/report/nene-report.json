            "Wakana: Ahh! Saturday was so fun! Hideaki: Sure was. The energy in the gym was the whole reason I wanted to start a band. Hideaki: I ended up quitting before I could experience something like that last time. I'm really happy I gave it another shot. Wakana: Yeah, same here! It felt sooo good! Hideaki: That's what she said. Wakana: Ugh, you're such a kid. Hideaki: You know... That cold look in your eyes is getting me excited in a whole nother way from the cheering... Wakana: And you're gross, too. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Oh, uh, I'm just thinking to myself. Tsumugi: Huh... Oh, are you thinking about keeping up the bass guitar? Shuuji: Like hell I am. It was fun, but it was hell on my fingers. I'm busy with the OC anyway. Shuuji: Like, if someone wanted me to perform for an event, I'd think about it. But no way am I doing it by myself. It's just way too much. Tsumugi: Really? Well then, what were you thinking about? Shuuji: Hmm... Shiiba-san, could you shake my hand? Tsumugi: Huh? I-I mean, I can... but why? Shuuji: Oh, whoops. Sorry for asking you to do that. Just forget about it; it wasn't for any special reason. Tsumugi: Huh? Ah... Wh-What do you mean? Like... don't ask me to do something so embarrassing if there's no good reason for it. Shuuji: I didn't mean to embarrass you. That was more embarrassing than I expected a handshake to be. Shuuji: A-Anyway, I got what I needed. Thanks. Tsumugi: Sure thing. Glad I could help you out somehow. Shuuji: ...... Tsumugi: ...... Tsumugi: So, um... Why are you still holding my hand? Shuuji: Oh, sorry. Wakana: Dunno. I gotta say, though, the way the two of you were holding hands and looking into each other's eyes was mighty suspicious. Shuuji: I swear it's nothing like that! Shuuji: I-I'm gonna go grab something to drink. Tsumugi: Okay, cool. See you later. Hideaki: He ran away. Wakana: He sure did. Tsumugi: Seriously, what was up with that? I kinda feel like I've just been toyed with... Shuuji: Whoa?! Touko: No need to act so surprised. Is seeing me that shocking? Shuuji: Oh, no, not at all. I was just thinking to myself. Touko: You were? You know, you get surprised far too often, Hoshina-kun. I'm pretty sure you reacted the exact same way when we first met, too. Shuuji: Yeah, actually. I remember that. Touko: Lost in thought again? Shuuji: Ah, sorry. Shuuji: So, what are you doing here, Senpai? Touko: I came to get a drink, of course. Shuuji: Oh, sorry. I'm blocking your way. Touko: It's okay. There's no rush. Shuuji: I was in the mood for something sweet. Touko: I like smoothies too. But I always worry about my weight when having such sugary drinks. Shuuji: Actually, this one doesn't have that many calories. Shuuji: And I don't think you have anything to worry about with your weight in the first place. Touko: Of course I do. I want a figure as perfect as Ayachi-san's. Shuuji: Really? You two are already pretty close, though. I think it's just a matter of personal taste at that point. Touko: I know I can never be like her, anyway. I'm not built that way... Shuuji: In my opinion, I don't see any need for you to change at all. You're fine the way you are. Touko: Really? Well, I'm happy to hear that, even if you're just being polite. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Huh? So...? So what? Touko: So, what were you thinking about? You can always talk to me if you have anything worrying you. Shuuji: Oh, it's nothing that serious. Touko: Don't worry, this won't count as your reward from the party. I'm just saying you can talk to me if you'd like. Touko: Come now. I'm your upperclassman, we're in the same club, and I'm even the former Student Council president. Whatever problems you have, you can lay them on me. Touko: Oh, but... I might not be of much help with any sexual stuff. I have no experience there. Shuuji: Oh, is that so? Touko: Oh, that's too bad. And here I was, trying to act like a good senior... Shuuji: Anyway, you decided to fully join the OC, huh? Touko: Yeah. I've also been working with the Student Council until now, so I didn't really have the time before. Touko: And I'll be a bother to Koshiji-san and the others if I stick around there. Shuuji: I don't think Koshiji-san would mind at all. Touko: Yeah, you're not wrong. But it'd be insensitive of me to use her just so I could go to the Student Council room. Touko: You know what I mean, don't you, Hoshina-kun? Shuuji: Yeah... Sorry. That was thoughtless of me. Touko: It's okay. It's just that the boundaries have already been drawn, and I don't think it'd be a good idea to overstep them. Touko: And in any case, they'd find it awkward having the former president hanging around the place. Shuuji: So then, you chose the OC? Touko: Yeah... I'm not getting in the way, am I? Shuuji: Not at all. I'm sure Ayachi-san and the others are delighted to have you. Touko: I think helping people solve their problems is admirable. Don't you agree? Shuuji: Yes. I think so too. Touko: That's why I want to help the OC. And I also thought I could help you too, if necessary... Touko: But if you're saying you're not troubled, then there's nothing I can do. You will come and talk to me if you need anything though, won't you? Shuuji: Yes, of course I will. Touko: You can come to me any time. Oh, and you better start thinking about your reward. Is there anything you'd like? Hmm... You can ask for anything you want. Touko: Though, it would be a bit of a problem for me if you asked for a naughty reward. Mufufu. Shuuji: I don't have the guts to ask something like that directly. Touko: Then... Could you ask something like that indirectly? Shuuji: Well... Um... I am a guy, and, err... it does interest me, so... Touko: You're so honest. I just love that about you. Shuuji: ...! Touko: Oh, lunch break is almost over. I better get back to class. Make sure you're not late either, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Yeah. Take care. Touko: See you at the OC～ Shuuji: She's always provocative and making dirty jokes, though... Wait a minute. Shuuji: I get the feeling her dirty side is all I ever think about whenever I talk to her. "

            "Koshiji: Our former Student Council President, Togakushi Touko-saaan! Touko: Hey everyone! Thank you! Thank you! Meguru: Ah, y-yeah, thanks... Though, I only finished eighth, which is nothing special... Female Classmate B: That's still amazing! An eighth place finish is really good with so many contestants! Female Classmate A: That's right! You look great in your costume! You should be proud of your ranking! Meguru: R-Roger... Female Classmate A: Ahaha, you're as stiff ever. Meguru: B-But the top spots are for all the popular students! Meguru: Like, Nene-senpai and Togakushi-senpai I can understand... But who was crazy enough to vote for me? Female Classmate B: I voted for you. Meguru: Whaaat?! Male Classmate A: Oh, I voted for you too. Meguru: What?! Wh-Why?! Why me?! Male Classmate A: Huh? Well, as thanks for helping me with that MonHun event a while back? Besides, you're the only one wearing a costume from our class. Female Classmate A: Yeah! Voting for a popular person like Togakushi-senpai is fine and all, but I'd rather vote for someone I actually know. Female Classmate B: Exactly! I'd rather vote for a friend I hang out with than some random popular girl. You gotta support your own. Meguru: Oh, uhh... Female Classmate A: Anyway, congrats Inaba-san! Meguru: Th-Thank you! Thank you so much! Meguru: ...Ah! Shuuji: You sure it's okay to ditch your classmates like that? Meguru: Oh, well, our conversation was just wrapping up... Meguru: Anyway, you gotta hear this! It's super amazing! Shuuji: Everyone seemed really happy for you. Meguru: They were! Everyone was psyched to see me finish in eighth! Meguru: They even all voted for me. Can you believe it? For me... Haha... Shuuji: That's great. Meguru: It is! I'm super happy about that. Though... I don't really get why. Meguru: It all seems so unreal... I can't believe my classmates are so happy for me. Meguru: Y-You think? Shuuji: I do. They wouldn't celebrate it so much otherwise. Shuuji: I mean, you were also really happy for our band performance, right? Meguru: Oh, y-yeah. Definitely! Seeing people I hang out with all the time perform like that was crazy amazing, and... Ah! Shuuji: Don't you think your classmates feel the same way? Meguru: O-Oh, of course. I see... Ehehe... That's right. So that's how everyone thinks of me. Meguru: Thank you, Senpai! I think I finally get it now. Shuuji: ...Though, it's a bit funny seeing a girl who was all \"I wanna be popular!\" suddenly worry about this stuff. Meguru: Ugh. Wh-What do you expect? Nothing like this has ever happened to me before! Meguru: But you don't have to point that kinda stuff out! You can be such a― Shuuji: No, for real. I'm really happy for you. I've been worrying about you, you know? Meguru: ...Huh? Shuuji: I was the one who helped you with your problem, so I was wondering about how things were going for you. Meguru: You were... concerned about me? Shuuji: Well, yeah. You seemed happy, so I figured things were going well... Shuuji: But now I can rest easy having seen the results for myself. Meguru: ...... Meguru: So then... it was you who was concerned about me the whole time. Meguru: Earlier you said I was showing concern for you, but it was actually the other way around... Shuuji: Let me say it again. I'm really happy to see you making such good friends. Meguru: Th-Thanks! Meguru: Umm, it's all thanks to you... Shuuji: Yeah. It was definitely worth voting for you. Meguru: ...What? Shuuji: What's wrong? Meguru: A-Aaaah! Wh-Why did you vote for me?! Shuuji: Why? Well... Because I thought your costume suited you better than anyone else's. Meguru: Oh, I know! You were just concerned about me. You must've voted for me out of pity or something. Shuuji: Nope. You're just really cute. Meguru: How can you just go and say that?! Shuuji: Why are you so surprised? Meguru: W-Well, because! You said I'm c-c-c-cu... Shuuji: Obviously, it would take more than your classmates to get you into eighth place. Shuuji: There's gotta be a ton of other people who voted for you. That just proves how cute you are in that costume, if you ask me. Meguru: A-And you think so too?! Shuuji: Yeah, of course. Meguru: ――― Meguru: Wha?! F-For real?! Shuuji: Yeah. I think your wolfgirl costume is a perfect match for your cheerful and slightly mischievous personality. Shuuji: You weren't able to win against Ayachi-san and Togakushi-senpai, but I would say that's simply because they're more popular. You're definitely on par with them, though. Meguru: Ah, aah, aaaa! Shuuji: You're also really cute when you're flapping your mouth like that. Meguru: Whaaat?! You're saying all of this stuff on purpose, aren't you?! Shuuji: Hahaha. You noticed? Meguru: You're the worst! How could you?! You don't actually think that I'm cute, do you?! Shuuji: No, I do. I wasn't lying. Meguru: ～～～?! Shuuji: Oh. Hey, Shiiba-san. Tsumugi: Huh? What's wrong? Your face is really red, Meguru-chan. Meguru: It's nothing... Don't worry about it... Ugh. Tsumugi: O-Okay...? Shuuji: You were looking for us? Tsumugi: Oh, yeah. I got something here from Togakushi-senpai. Shuuji: A camera...? Tsumugi: She said that since you'll only wear these costumes for today, she wanted to take some pictures to commemorate the event. Shuuji: Oh, yeah. That's a good idea. Shuuji: You're taking a picture of me too? Tsumugi: Of course～ You're wearing a costume too, silly. Shuuji: Well, I guess... But would she really want a pic of me? Tsumugi: Huh? Why wouldn't she? Shuuji: I'm not nearly as photogenic as Inaba-san. Besides, this is kinda embarrassing... Meguru: In that case, Senpai! Shuuji: Hm? Meguru: Let's take the pic together! Meguru: There's no problem with both of us being in the same photo, is there? Tsumugi: No, that's fine. Actually, maybe that's even better. Meguru: Alright, let's do this! Come on, Senpai! Shuuji: O-Ouch! Don't slap me on my back! Meguru: Oh, geez, there you go again! You're doing this on purpose, aren't you?! I can't believe you! Meguru: Now I won't be happy until we take this photo together! Okay, Tsumugi-senpai. Go ahead and do it! Tsumugi: Ahaha. Alright! Shuuji: Yeah, because of you. Since you apparently won't be happy until we do this. Meguru: ...... Tsumugi: Okay, I'm taking it now. Shuuji: Gotcha! Meguru: ...Wouldn't it be boring if all we do is stand next to each other? We don't take a pic like this every day. Shuuji: Huh? Meguru: So... Meguru: There! Shuuji: ?! Meguru: It's to commemorate the party! We need to look like we're having a good time! Shuuji: S-Sure, but... Shuuji: Wait a minute! Didn't you say a while ago that clinging onto a guy is obscene?!  Meguru: You're bringing that up now?! That's the only thing that's sexual harassment here! This doesn't count! Meguru: Besides, I'm not clinging to you! I just got a little excited and am sticking a little close to you. That's all! Shuuji: What kind of excuse is that?! Shuuji: Wh-What is it? Meguru: Senpai, are you actually embarrassed? Shuuji: ?! N-Not at all! Meguru: Reeeally? Your face is totally red! Meguru: And all I did was get a little close to you. Nihihi... I made your heart skip a beat, huh? Shuuji: Don't act so triumphant! You just took me by surprise! Meguru: Ahahaha! So you admit it now? Meguru: I see, I see. You're always so depressed, but you can actually be pretty cute too♪ Shuuji: Gah... Meguru: Oh, wait a second. I want to make the best of this and get even closer. There♪ Shuuji: Wha?! Tsumugi: Whoa... Y-You're so bold, Meguru-chan. You've practically glued yourself to him. Meguru: Well, just look at him! Hoshina-senpai is blushing so much! Shuuji: You were so embarrassed just a few minutes ago... Meguru: Feel free to hug me back. That is, if you have the balls to. Ahaha! Tsumugi: A-Are you ready too, Hoshina-kun? Shuuji: No wait... Since she said I could... Shuuji: Take this!  Meguru: Hyaahn?! Shuuji: Huh? Shuuji: E-Err, I just pulled you a little closer to me... Look. Meguru: Ahh! Waahhh?! B-But you're touching my waist... Yaahn! Meguru: W-Well, it's okay to stay like this. As long as you lighten your grip a little. Shuuji: ...What? Meguru: I'm the one who said you could hug me back. Meguru: Besides, I already knew that you're a super perv... when I clung to you like this... Shuuji: ...... Meguru: Ahh, geez! Just hurry and take the pic, Tsumugi-senpai! Tsumugi: O-Okay! Meguru: Hey, Senpai, look into the camera! Shuuji: O-Oh, yeah! Tsumugi: Okay then... Say cheese! Meguru, Shuuji: Cheese! Nene: Nnmmph! You mean while you're hugging me like this? It would defeat the point if you can't see my costume well, though... Meguru: Maybe, but I can't help it. You're so cute, and I love you so much! Meguru: Nene-senpai, hug me back. Come on! Touko: Hehehe... Inaba-san's been taken from you, huh? Shuuji: You saw us together? Touko: Of course. I wanted to make sure Shiiba-san was taking photos of everyone like I asked. Touko: Which was when I found you taking advantage of the party to get all touchy-feely with Inaba-san. Shuuji: D-Don't go making crap up like that. You say it like I was making a move on her. Touko: But you had your hand around her waist and were holding her tight, weren't you? Touko: You looked like you were claiming her as yours. Mufufu... Shuuji: Stop embellishing the facts! Shuuji: She hugged me and told me to do the same. So I just obliged. That's all... Touko: Oh? Like she's hugging Ayachi-san right now? Shuuji: Yeah... That's right...? "

Shuuji: Your advice really helped me a lot. So thank you for that.  Touko: It wasn't much of anything special, but if it helped, then I'm glad.  Touko: Fights happen from time to time in relationships, no matter how much you love each other. You just have to not be stubborn about things, and consider what you truly value.  Shuuji: Yeah. I think you're completely right with that. "

Don't go back to sleep on me. It's time to get up. Shuuji: It has to be a dream. No other reason you'd be in my room first thing in the morning... Mmm, I love you, bed. Nene: Stop talking nonsense and get up. We need to get to school.  Shuuji: Mhh... Nene: You're just pretending to be asleep, aren't you? If you don't get up... I won't be happy with you.  Shuuji: Oh... And what are you gonna do...? Nene: I'll forcibly get you up... Mhh *kiss* Shuuji: Mhhh?! Shuuji: N-Nene...? The real Nene? This is real? It's not a dream? Nene: Good morning. Shuuji: M-Morning... B-But why am I... Shuuji: Oh no, you don't have to worry about that.  Shuuji: Besides, it's the guy's job to comfort his girlfriend when she's feeling scared.  Nene: But you had to stay over here because of that... Surely your father wasn't too pleased... Shuuji: Eh, he didn't care. Heck, when I told him I was sleeping over at a friend's place, he was practically jumping for joy. Said he was glad I've been making friends.  Nene: That's relieving.  Shuuji: Oh, heck yeah I would! Thanks for doing this, Nene. Nene: Oh no, it's nothing worth mentioning... Also, I made lunch for us too, so let's eat together later at school. Shuuji: Perfect. I can't wait.  Nene: You do like rice, don't you? Here, I have some for you.  Shuuji: Ah, yeah, thanks. Shuuji: Nope, just savoring this bliss. Waking up to breakfast is a nice feeling.  Shuuji: It's almost like we're married.  Nene: ...... Nene: Th-That might be true... You're going to make me blush if you say that.  Nene: Please help yourself. Shuuji: ...Hm? What're you so giddy over? Nene: And I got to spend the night with you too, so that meant I could watch you as you slept.  Shuuji: ...Stop, you're embarrassing me.  Nene: It made me really happy. I got to see a face of yours I've never seen before.  Shuuji: Is it really that special? Well, I guess it has to be a little different... But hey, do you think I've been acting a little childish around you?  Shuuji: I kinda sat down and thought about it once, and I let you spoil me quite a bit.  Nene: Do you think so? I, um... Didn't really notice that. I thought it was the other way around, really... Nene: Oh, but I can see what you're talking about. You can be quite childish at times.  Shuuji: So you do think so...? Nene: Fueh?! W-Well... umm... I-I'm fine with it. I don't mind it at all. I mean, it did, umm... f-feel good when you... Shuuji: ...What? Nene: Y-You know, wh-when you sucked on my boobs... You were almost like a baby, and I found that really cute... I also enjoyed it, so well... I don't mind you being childish.  Shuuji: THAT'S what you think of when I say childish?! Nene: Nghhh... Gosh! Stop making me talk about these things in the middle of the street! Nene: I'll say it again, okay? I'm totally fine with it. I love everything about you. Your childish side... Your kind, gentle side―everything.  Shuuji: Me too. I love everything about you, from how you can be so cute, to how you can be childish and stubborn.  Shuuji: I also like how dirty you can be.  Nene: Nnh―――! Nene: ...Well, I don't like how much of a meanie-pants you are. If you tease me too much, I won't like you anymore. Shuuji: What...? You won't... like me? Nene: ...... Nene: Urk... Nene: Ngggghhhhhhh...! Shuuji: ...... Nene: D-Don't give me those puppy-dog eyes! I was lying, okay? I didn't mean it! Nene: You know I'd never stop liking you.  Shuuji: Phew. That's a relief.  Nene: ...You're such a meanie, Shuuji-kun. Shuuji: Sorry. But if there's one other thing I love about you, it's you and your cute reactions. Nene: Don't think you can weasel your way out of any situation just by telling me you love me. I'm not that gullible.  Shuuji: Huh? Nene: ...Do you have something to say?  Shuuji: Ah, err... No. Forget it. Tsumugi: Hey there. Nene: Good morning, Inaba-san. Good morning, Shiiba-san. Shuuji: Morning. Meguru, Tsumugi: ...... Nene: I-Is everything okay? You're staring at me rather intently. Do I have bed head or something? Meguru: Oh, hardly. You look absolutely fantastic.  Tsumugi: We're just glad to see you two back together.  Meguru: Everything seems to be back to normal, and we're happy for you two.  Shuuji: Sorry for worrying you. Tsumugi: But man, I am soo relieved.  Nene: I'm very sorry for all the trouble we caused you. But it's alright now. I've decided not to lie to myself any further, so we're going to be back to normal from now on. Meguru: That's perfect.

Shuuji: ...... Nene: ...... Shuuji: ...Yeah, there is. Nene: Could you tell me about it? Shuuji: Okay. The truth is, as embarrassing as it is to admit... Shuuji: It's about Meguru. I like her. I really like her. Nene: ...I see. Shuuji: I don't think she hates me or anything, but my power can only read feelings, not thoughts... Shuuji: So...

Meguru: Can't you read my feelings right now? Shuuji: Well... Meguru: Then read them! I'm terrible at expressing my feelings, and I hate it! Meguru: Besides, unlike you, I can't tell anything at all... Meguru: That's why I keep agonizing over this... Meguru: About how you think of me. Meguru: About whether you feel the same as I do.

            "Guy: What's up? You took on someone else's work again, didn't you? Shuuji: For a Library Committee member, yeah. Apparently, there's something important going on today she can't put off. Guy: Library Committee? Oh... You mean Akita? Guy: She's probably just playing you. There's a reason people call her the \"mixer queen.\" That thing she can't put off is 100\\% just another mixer. She was even talking about the details in the classroom. Shuuji: Oh, a mixer... I see. I suppose that does involve her future, in a way. Guy: Don't tell me you already knew? Shuuji: Kind of. I didn't know what exactly she was doing, but I did have the feeling it wasn't as important as she made it sound. Shuuji: Well, I could have, but... I just figured that I may as well do it if she already has other plans. Guy: Shuuji... Seriously... Hideaki: Want me to tell them no for you? Shuuji: Don't bother. I appreciate the offer, but I'm not a little child; I'm perfectly capable of saying no when I really don't want to do something. Hideaki: ...And yet I've never seen you do so. Shuuji: Well, I don't have much to do after school, anyway. And it's not like people ask me for help every day. Hideaki: But that doesn't mean you should work for these people while they're out having fun. Hideaki: Whatever. How many times have we had this exchange now? I'm sick of telling you this all the time. Shuuji: Sorry. Shuuji: Not really... I don't have any good reason for it. Shuuji: I just figure that being nice to girls could come in handy someday. Hideaki: At this rate, those leeches will suck you dry, dude. Shuuji: I'm obviously not gonna be as lax with my money. Shuuji: It's just... I can't stand that awkwardness you get when turning people down. Anyway, it's different when I have something to do myself, but I don't mind helping when I'm free. Hideaki: ...I swear, you're gonna get scammed real hard at some point, and it'll suck. Girl: Yeah, I can see it now. It's scary just thinking about it. Hideaki: I know, right? You're with me, aren't you, Wakana-chan? Girl: Yeah. It's not normal to accept every single request, if you ask me. You're not hiding something from us, are ya? Shuuji: Err... Wakana: If I had to guess, maybe he's a hardcore masochist? Shuuji: That's a rather extreme assumption. Hideaki: A hardcore masochist?! I see. So you've been taking on all this work in order to get turned on at school... I never would've expected it... Hideaki: You should've told me we were comrades! Shuuji: Keep your fetishes to yourself, dude! You're freaking me out! Wakana: Huh? You mean having girls work you like a dog DOESN'T turn you on? Shuuji: It really stings to see you so genuinely confused by that. Shuuji: And really, girls shouldn't talk about fetishes in the broad daylight. Wakana: What kind of sexist BS is this? Girls are allowed to talk about sex too. Shuuji: Sure, but usually you keep that sort of talk between girls. Shuuji: You got the hots for me or something? Wakana: Hahaha. Nice joke. I know you don't mean that. Hideaki: Though, it is true that girls talking about that stuff can give us guys the wrong idea. Wakana: Well, we only do so around guys we have no interest in. It's just a normal way to make conversation. Don't read too much into it. Shuuji: Either way, I don't get especially happy or anything when people work me. Hideaki: Yeah, sure. Says the guy who takes every request that comes his way. Shuuji: Well... It's just... Shuuji: Won't girls really like me if I never turn them down? Wakana: Ahahahaha! Not at all. If anything, it makes you look like a dumbass. Shuuji: Man, it stings when you say that so bluntly. Hideaki: You need to turn people down every once in a while. You'll get taken advantage of if you let them think you're so soft. Shuuji: You think I'll get taken advantage of...? Now you're just exaggerating. Wakana: I'm not. There are some nasty girls out there who will totally suck you dry with the way you are now. Shuuji: As if. You're clearly overthinking. Wakana: Tch, tch. You're being naive. Women can be much more calculating than you think. Hideaki: They'll make you pay for their food, for movie tickets, and even for accessories like purses! And all they'll give in return is a \"That was a fun way to kill some time. Thanks! See ya♪\" without any progress between the two of you. Hideaki: And then right after that, they'll suddenly call you and ask you to come pick them up because they missed the last train! For freaking real?! There's mischievous and then there's just plain evil! Wakana, Shuuji: ...... Hideaki: Ah?! S-Sorry guys, all my pent-up frustration just kinda exploded there. Shuuji: Looks like you've been through some serious shit, man. Hideaki: Yeah... I used to mess around a lot. But it's all in the past now. Wakana: That sounds like a real nasty girl you ran into. Shuuji: But getting used like that actually made you happy, didn't it? Hideaki: Well... Yeah, a little. Wakana: Ugh, are you grinning?! What a masochist... Terrifying. Shuuji: I seriously don't get how someone can feel pleasure from being treated so crappily. Hideaki: Hehe... That figures. You two are just greenhorns, after all. Shuuji: I'm not planning on ever becoming a masochist veteran. Shuuji: I wouldn't want that... Alright. I'll be more careful from now on. Hideaki: Have you guys forgotten that I'm right here? Hearing that really hurts, you know? Shuuji: I've got a question. Wakana: Go ahead, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: How do I avoid being taken advantage of while coming off as soft? Wakana: Coming off as soft is already a given? Shuuji: I just feel like I'd get on the girls' bad sides if I suddenly changed my whole attitude, which is scary in its own way. Wakana: Well, I guess that's possible. Hideaki: If you want an example of someone who's kind but doesn't get taken advantage of... Wakana: There's Ayachi-san. Hideaki: Oh, right. She's a perfect example. Girl: Yes? You called me? Hideaki: Whoa! A-Ayachi-san?! Ayachi-san: I'm sorry to have startled you. I just so happened to overhear my name when I was passing by. Ayachi-san: Is there something you need with me? Wakana: Oh, uh, don't worry about us. Your name just came up in our conversation. Hideaki: Yeah, we weren't gossiping about you or anything. Shuuji: Sorry if we offended you. Ayachi-san: Oh no, I'm not upset; I was just curious. Please don't mind me. Ayachi-san: Anyway, Kariya-san, about the thing from before... Wakana: Ah! Yeah, it's going great! That place you introduced me to is awesome! Things are going great thanks to you. Thanks so much! Ayachi-san: I'm happy to hear you like it there. Wakana: I'm really thankful to you. Ayachi-san: Please don't hesitate to visit the clubroom again should something else come up. Wakana: Thanks! I will! Schoolgirl B: Ah, Ayachi-saaan! Thanks for letting me borrow your notebook. You were a life-saver. And I have to say, the notes you took were super neat. You're awesome! Ayachi-san: Oh, it was no big deal. More importantly, are you feeling better now? Schoolgirl B: Yeah, I feel great! Ayachi-san: I'm glad to hear that. Is there anything else that is troubling you? Schoolgirl B: No, nothing at the moment. Ayachi-san: I'm willing to help you out or lend an ear to your worries anytime. It doesn't need to be school related; I'm happy to listen to private or other problems too. Schoolgirl B: Thanks. I'll be sure to stop by if something comes up. Ayachi-san: Yes, please do. Shuuji: Huh? Umm... What do you mean? Nene: I'd be glad to help if something should ever concern you. Shuuji: Oh, thanks. I'm happy for the offer, but there's nothing like that right now. Nene: Is that so? For some reason, I got the feeling that there's something worrying you... Shuuji: Y-Yeah...? Shuuji: Yeah...? Nene: No, I haven't... I just had a gut feeling about it. Wakana: Considering how many people you've helped, I think you're right to trust that feeling. Shuuji: What's that supposed to mean? The part about her helping people. Wakana: Oh, whoops... Right... Sorry, Ayachi-san! You're keeping this from the guys, aren't you? Nene: Oh, no, it's not that big of a secret, so don't worry about it. Nene: It would just be a problem for me if people showed up out of curiosity, so I'm asking that you only keep it to people who actually need help. Hideaki: ...? Did we overhear something we shouldn't have? Nene: It's nothing that big... I'm in the OC. Hideaki: OC? Shuuji: Um, you mean... the Occult Club? Nene: Yes. That's right. Shuuji: I didn't know we had one of those at this school. This is the first I'm hearing of it. Hideaki: Same here. And it's not just a circle, but an actual club? Nene: That's right. It's a club that's been around since before we entered this school. Though, I'm currently the only member. Nene: The Student Council has been on our case because of that... After all, the club doesn't do any sort of exhibitions or the like. Hideaki: So... do you research ghosts or something? Or maybe aliens? Nene: No, I am doing divination. \"Occult\" involves the entire spectrum of the supernatural. I am thankfully able to do as I please since I am the only member. Hideaki: By divination you mean, doing hand signs and being like \"And there we have it!\"? Shuuji: It's impressive how old that reference is. I don't think anyone is gonna get that. Wakana: You instantly recognizing it is just as impressive. I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. You guys are such geeks. Right, Ayachi-san? Nene: I obviously can't do Albino Snake Divination. Wakana: You know about it too?! Nene: Yeah, kind of, but I can only do tarot card reading. Divination is nothing more than a hobby for me, after all. Wakana: Anyway, she's also offering counseling there. Nene: It's really just part of the divination I'm doing. It hardly deserves to be called \"counseling.\" Nene: But if you want, don't hesitate to come over to my clubroom anytime, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Oh, sure. Thanks. Schoolgirl A: Ayachi-saaan! I need your help with our classic Japanese homework! Nene: Oh, of course. I'll be right there. Nene: Okay then. I must excuse myself now. Hideaki: She's almost a little too perfect to be real. Hideaki: But anyway, people consult her for a lot of stuff, huh? I would've expected that to turn into a big rumor. Wakana: It's well-known among girls. It'd be a big problem for Ayachi-san if the guys found out and caused a commotion, though. Hideaki: Ah, is that so... Maybe I should pay her a visit too, and then... Ehee! Shuuji: Allow me to read your thoughts: \"Maybe I could get closer to her.\" Hideaki: Huh?! What?! Espers are real? And you're one of them?! Wakana: What're you talking about? You couldn't have been more obvious. You were practically oozing with sleaze. Shuuji: You're even drooling some. Hideaki: Really?! Oh, you're right! Shuuji: I'm guessing that the girls don't spread that rumor around because of how many guys like you there are. Wakana: That's right. You two better keep this to yourselves. Hideaki: Sure. You bet! Shuuji: So anyway, did you also consult her about something, Kariya? I mean, you just thanked her and all. Wakana: I did. I really want something, but I was worried because I didn't have the money for it. Shuuji: What do you want? Wakana: Well... A guitar. Hideaki: A guitar? Sure didn't expect that. Shuuji: You can play the guitar? Well, I guess you wouldn't want one if you couldn't. Wakana: Yeah, a little. Wakana: It's been a few years now, and so I'd like to finally get my own guitar. Shuuji: Huh. My only musical experience comes from music class, though that was ages ago. Hideaki: I could probably play a bit better than Shuuji, then. I had a phase where I was really into music, and so I tried my hand at the guitar. Wakana: Oh, really? That's unexpected. Hideaki: Well, that was a while ago. So? Since you're saving up money, you gonna get a good one? Wakana: Yeah, I'd like a decent one, at least. Though, the prices of musical instruments are pretty crazy. Shuuji: True. Especially vintage instruments. The amount those go for is just bonkers. Wakana: Dad told me to get one with my own money. Would it have killed him to give me at least some of the money for it? Shuuji: So, how did Ayachi-san help you with that? Wakana: She introduced me to a part-time job. Wakana: And now I'm going to finally reach my goal with my next paycheck, meaning I'll be getting my guitar really soon♪ Uhehe. Hideaki: A part-time job, huh? That's nice. Maybe I could have her introduce me to one as well? Wakana: Allow me to read your thoughts: \"Maybe then, I could get closer to her. I could even ask her out on a date to 'repay her' with my first paycheck!\" Hideaki: Is everyone I know a freaking esper?! Shuuji: Look, anyone could guess as much. The fact that she was right just means you're simple. Hideaki: Wh-Whatever! Who cares! Besides, as a guy, I can't let an opportunity to get to know a cute girl like her slip by! Wakana: Well, you have a point... I guess. Shuuji: I'm guessing all the other single guys out there are looking for opportunities too. Student 2: What was it about? I-I want to know... Damn, I'm so jealous of them. Student 3: Damn it... I wanna chat with her too. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Uh... It's nothing. Hideaki: Don't act like this is none of your business. You'd love to get closer with Ayachi-san too, right? Why not get a tarot reading from her? She invited you for one, after all. Shuuji: I dunno... I'll swing by and ask for one once something comes up. Hideaki: What a waste. Wakana: I feel like she wouldn't like it if he went there without a good reason. Hideaki: Huh?! Really? Wakana: Nobody likes a guy who clearly has ulterior motives, you know? Hideaki: Except when you're hot. Wakana: Well, too bad you aren't. Hideaki: Wow! How could you?! Wakana: I don't think girls like Ayachi-san are that shallow. What matters is if you're attractive on the inside, not the outside. Hideaki: I see. Wakana: Besides, people with great personalities wouldn't approach her like that in the first place. Hideaki: Ugh... I guess it's game, set and match for me. Shuuji: Guys, we better head back to class. Afternoon classes are about to start. Wakana: Oh, yeah. Right. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: (Phew...) Shuuji: It's cool. Don't worry about it. Girl: Thanks. Okay then, bye-bye♪ Shuuji: See you tomorrow. Hideaki: So you're still doing this, huh? Shuuji: For today, yeah. It wouldn't be right to turn her down now after I already told her I'd do it. Wakana: Yeah, fair enough. Hideaki: *sigh*... Okay, fine. Want me to give you a hand? Shuuji: Err... Shuuji: I appreciate the sentiment, but no thanks. Hideaki: Knew you'd say that. Wakana: Yeah, it was practically a given. Shuuji: What do you mean? Hideaki: You're a real lone wolf, dude. Shuuji: Okay, look. All I'm doing today is entering some data into their computer database, so I really don't need your help. Shuuji: I'll ask you for help for sure next time something like this happens. Wakana: Stubborn to the end, I see. Hideaki: There's not supposed to be a \"next time.\" You're supposed to turn them down instead. Shuuji: Yeah, yeah. I know. Hideaki: Looks like he's gonna keep on helping people after this. Wakana: That's just how he is. It's not something that can be fixed that easily. Wakana: No point in nagging him about it any further. Hideaki: I'll be on my way, then. What about you, Wakana-chan? Wanna go somewhere if you're free? Wakana: Together with you? Hideaki: Yeah. Wakana: Just the two of us? Hideaki: Yeah! Wakana: Yeah, no way♪ Hideaki: Your blunt replies are too cruel! Wakana: I'm sorry, but I'm busy today. Hideaki: What plans? Wakana: That part-time job. Hideaki: The one Ayachi-san introduced you to? Wakana: Yep. So I don't have time today. Sorry. Hideaki: Work, huh... Well, I guess that's―Huh? Hold on a second. Hideaki: Then why did you ask if it would be the two of us?! Wouldn't that be completely irrelevant?! Wakana: That's just your imagination! Shuuji: If you have school in the day and work in the evening, then doesn't that mean you have no time for homework or studying? Wakana: Yeah, pretty much. I always end up crashing as soon as I come home from work... Wakana: Ugh, our next exams are gonna be rough... Once I get my new guitar, I'm gonna play that bad boy nonstop... Uhehe. Wakana: Oh! I'll be late if I keep standing around chatting like this. See you guys later! Gotta go! Shuuji: See you tomorrow. Hideaki: Don't trip on your shoelaces as you run! Shuuji: Well then, I'll head over to the library now. Hideaki: Yeah, see you. Shuuji: I've been told to come here and register some new books into the library catalog. Committee Girl: Huh? Umm... And you are? I don't remember you being in the Library Committee. Shuuji: I'm filling in for Akita from class 2-A. Apparently, she has something she can't call off and asked me to fill in for her. Committee Girl: Oh, really? If that's how it is... I guess that's alright. Okay, I'm counting on you, then. Shuuji: Sorry, but could you teach me how to do it? Committee Girl: Sure. It's not too hard. Could you sit down at the computer there? Shuuji: Yeah, sure. Committee Girl: So first, you open the database, and then... Okay, there we go. Committee Girl: See the different fields here? Category, title, author, publisher and so on. You have to fill all of them out. Shuuji: I only have to enter the data there and that's it? Committee Girl: Yeah, that's right. Click the register button once they're filled out, and then you'll be back at the main database interface again. Well? Think you can manage? Shuuji: Yeah, probably. Is it okay to ask you if I have any questions later? Committee Girl: Sure thing. Alright, the books you need to register are piled up over here. This is all of them. Shuuji: Got it. Shuuji: Mhm, nnngh... Committee Girl: Umm... You done yet? Shuuji: No, sorry. Shouldn't take much longer, though. Committee Girl: ...Oh. Shuuji: ...... Committee Girl: Huh? Shuuji: I doubt anyone is gonna come by this late anyway, and I can return the key to the faculty room myself once I'm done. Committee Girl: But you aren't on the committee... Shuuji: I've come here to work in place of a Library Committee member. I'm sure me being the one to lock the room up wouldn't be a problem. Committee Girl: You think? Committee Girl: O-Okay then... Could you please handle that for me? Here's the key. Shuuji: Yeah, sure. Committee Girl: Thanks a bunch! I'm off, then! Shuuji: Yeah, bye! Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: ...Hm? Voice: You're kidding me. I came to check up on them since they never came to return the key, and they're nowhere to be seen... I'll need to have a word with them. Girl: Umm, Sensei. Nene: Yes. Time slipped away from me. Sensei: Ah. Well, you shouldn't dawdle around here too much. Nene: Is... there one else here in the library? Sensei: It would seem so. I'm about to lock the room. Nene: I would like you to let me look something up before that. Could you lend me the key? Sensei: You want to look something up this late? Nene: Yes, just something about tarot cards. It won't take much time at all. I'll just need five... no, maybe twenty minutes. Please.  Sensei: ...Well, I suppose I can trust you. Okay, here's the key. Sensei: However, you are to return it to the faculty room within thirty minutes. And make absolutely sure that the room is locked when you leave. Nene: Understood. Thank you very much. Sensei: Alright, goodbye. Nene: Y-Yes... Goodbye... *pant* *pant*... Shuuji: (......?) Shuuji: (...What?) Nene: Ah... ah! Mh... Mhh, mh, mh, mhhh... Shuuji: ...... Nene: Mhh *huff*... *pant* *pant* Ah, aaaah... Fuaaaah... Shuuji: (*gulp*) Nene: No time. I need to hurry, or else... she'll come back... If she sees me doing this... Mhh, mh, mhh, mh!

I'm cumming, I'm cumming, I'm cumming, I'm cumming, I'm cumming! Nene: Mhh, mhhhhhhhhhhhh!! Nene: I don't want to move now, but she'll come to check otherwise... I need, to hurry... *pant*... *pant*... But I can't, get any strength, into my body... "

Meguru: You're the worst. Shuuji: ...I'm seriously sorry. Tsumugi: Well, it was break time, and the door was locked... You normally wouldn't think I could be changing inside. Shuuji: Err, well... Yeah. I didn't expect it at all. Nene: I'm very sorry. I should have informed Hoshina-kun beforehand. Tsumugi: You don't need to apologize. There was no time for that since it was just after P.E., right? So... No one is to blame there. Tsumugi: Really, don't worry about it. Actually, umm... Rather than you apologizing, I would like you to forget. Tsumugi: L-Let's just say you never saw anything. Shuuji: Got it. I haven't seen anything. Shuuji: I didn't see you in your underwear at all. Tsumugi: Fueeeeeeaaaahhh! Shuuji: Ahh! Sorry! I didn't mean to say that! I'll forget about it! I'll forget everything! Meguru: I can't tell if you're a pervert or just an idiot! Why would you go in for an extra blow in this situation, super-perv Senpai?! Shuuji: Yeah, I have no excuse. Shuuji: I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Meguru: But why were you changing in the clubroom, anyway, Shiiba-senpai? Nene: I suggested doing so because it looked like she was embarrassed by changing in the locker room. Nene: I already had the key on me, so the clubroom was the first room I thought of for changing in... Shuuji: Why was it embarrassing? You're all girls. Tsumugi: Well, umm... You see, I really surprised everyone when I entered the locker room to change before P.E. Tsumugi: And then actually changing was really embarrassing too. Shuuji: Because everyone was already looking at you? Tsumugi: Partly, yeah... But also, everyone else was able to skillfully change without fully taking off their uniforms. Shuuji: Without taking off their uniforms...? Like how elementary schoolchildren change into swimsuits? Tsumugi: Yeah, right... Shuuji: Girls do that even though it's only other girls in the locker room? Tsumugi: Yeah, they do. Shuuji: Is that common? Nene: Yes. Even when it's with other girls, it's still uncomfortable to be seen half-naked. Meguru: Right. And there's stuff like not wanting to be laughed at for the underwear you're wearing. Shuuji: Is that so? Nene: There's a lot to consider with underwear, such as the comfort level. You tend to wear your most comfortable underwear more often... Nene: But they wear out quickly when you do that, so... Ah! Don't make me say weird stuff like that! Shuuji: No! You did this yourself! Don't blame me for blurting that out on your own! Shuuji: I don't want to know about that kind of stuff, anyway! Tsumugi: But anyway, I can't get around taking off my pants, right? Which is why, umm... I can't avoid letting everyone see my underwear. Shuuji: Well... If you don't take measures beforehand, that's how it turns out, yeah. Tsumugi: Besides, everyone kept looking at me.  Tsumugi: \"She's wearing a boy's uniform, but what about her underwear? Is she wearing a chest binder?\" You could tell that's what everyone was thinking. Shuuji: Yeah, I can see that. Meguru: To be perfectly honest, I've been a little curious about that myself. Tsumugi: I-I'm wearing perfectly normal girls' underwear! I can't show you, though... Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Oh, uh, absolutely nothing! Meguru: But despite that, you ended up experiencing something even more embarrassing... Nene: But you can't keep changing in the clubroom, so we need to come up with another solution. Tsumugi: Right... *sigh* Meguru: Heh heh heh. This is my time to shine. Nene: What do you mean? Meguru: Remember how we talked about changing her hairstyle yesterday? Shuuji: Oh yeah... You mean how changing her hairstyle could change everyone's impression of her? Meguru: Exactly. So, I've already gotten everything ready! Tsumugi: R-Really?! Meguru: Yep! So please, sit down here! I'll do your hair for you. Tsumugi: U-Umm... Okay, thank you so much. Meguru: ～～～♪ Meguru: You have nothing to be embarrassed about! I'm so jealous of your glossy hair. I wish I had hair like that. Tsumugi: You shouldn't worry about that. I mean, your fluffy hair is totally cute. Meguru: I'd rather have it be glossy and silky. But really, your hair is just fantastic～ Nene: Is it that amazing? Meguru: Go ahead and touch it yourself, Nene-senpai. Nene: Okay then, if Shiiba-san doesn't mind... Nene: Wow, it really is smooth. How nice... I'm getting a little jealous myself. Meguru: Oh, please. You have no right to be jealous. Just look at how silky your hair is! Nene: Ah, d-don't! It tickles when you touch me there. Meguru: How interesting... Your nape is ticklish, is it? Tsumugi: Fueh? Ah, hey, sto―! Ahhnn! Shuuji: ...... Tsumugi: Geez, knock it off～ Nene: Inaba-san, no means no, okay? Meguru: 'Kay! Shiiba-senpai, sorry about that. I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable. Shuuji: Is it really that smooth? Mind if I― Nene, Meguru, Tsumugi: ...... Shuuji: Ah, right. Of course I can't. I just thought it wouldn't hurt to ask. Don't mind me. Tsumugi: Y-Yeah, okay. Nene: Shiiba-san, are there any specific hairstyles that you would like? Tsumugi: Let me think... Not really. Anything cute will do! Meguru: Anything cute? Roger that! Meguru: Then, I guess I'll go with this accessory... Or maybe this one? Which would look better? Nene: If she wants to look cute, then I would say this one here, no? Meguru: Ah! That one is great! Way to go, Nene-senpai! You have great taste. Tsumugi: U-Umm, I'm not really used to this kind of thing, so I'm kind of uneasy about it. Just take it slow, okay? Take it slow. Meguru: I'm not sure what there is to be uneasy about... But if that's what you want, then let's just go for a cute hairstyle with no accessories. Meguru: ～～～♪ Nene: A braided hairstyle? Like, in pigtails?  Meguru: Right. Some manga have pretty boys who wear braids, so I think it's worth a try. Tsumugi: I've never braided my hair before. Meguru: Don't worry about it. Your hair is long enough, and it's pretty easy to do. Meguru: Just divide the hair into three strands, cross one outer strand over the middle one, then the other, and... Meguru: Voila! What do you think, Shiiba-senpai? Tsumugi: Umm... Ah, good. It looks like I'm fine! "

            "Wakana: Ah! Yeah, it's going great! That place you introduced me to is awesome! Thanks so much! Nene: Oh, I didn't do anything special. I'm just glad that I was able to help. Please don't hesitate to stop by the clubroom again should something else come up. Wakana: Thanks! But I'll be fine. It's just working and earning the money from here on out, after all! Hideaki: ...Umm, may I ask a question? Wakana: Hm? What do you want? Hideaki: What're y'all talking about? And whose clubroom? Wakana: Oh... About that, umm... Do you want me to tell them, Ayachi-san? Nene: I don't mind. As long as you don't thoughtlessly spread it around, you can tell a few people. Hideaki: What's this? Some kind of secret? Nene: Nothing that important. She's talking about me being in the OC.  Shuuji: OC... You mean the Occult Club? Hideaki: Never knew we had a club like that at this school.  Nene: It has been around since before we were here, actually. Though, unfortunately, I'm the only current member.  Hideaki: So with this occult stuff... Are you researching ghosts, or like aliens, or something? Nene: No, I'm doing divination. \"Occult\" encompasses the entire spectrum of the supernatural. Wakana: And she also offers counseling as a bit of a side thing.  Shuuji: So I guess you went and asked for her help on something? Wakana: Yup. Hideaki: Huh. Didn't think someone like you actually worried about things.  Wakana: ...You're the last person I want to hear that from. Wakana: But yeah, it's nothing big really. I just don't have the money to buy something I want. Wakana: And when I went to her for help, she got me this great part-time job.  Nene: You're saving up for a guitar, right? Shuuji: Oh, you can play the guitar? Wakana: I can, actually. Though, I'm not really a pro or anything. Wakana: I found my dad's old guitar a while back, and he's been teaching me ever since. Apparently, he used to be in a band. Wakana: I've been going at it for a few years now, so I've been wanting to get my own, but the one I'm looking at's pretty darn expensive.  Shuuji: And that's why you went to Ayachi-san. I see.  Wakana: Basically, yep.  Hideaki: So you play the guitar, eh? Boy, that sure takes me back. Wakana: Can you play guitar too? Hideaki: If it's just simple chords and crap, yeah. I didn't play the guitar for very long. Nene: Right. You prefer the drums.  Hideaki: ...Huh? Wakana: You play the drums, Kaidou? Shuuji: Seriously? Hideaki: Y-Yeah... I played the drums seriously till about a year ago, during summer. How'd you know that, Ayachi-san? Nene: Ah...! Well, umm... Hideaki: Did you see one of our performances at a club? Wait, no, that can't be it. I definitely would've remembered seeing a pretty girl like you there.  Hideaki: There really weren't a lot of people there... What was it, then? Nene: Well, umm... er, that's... because... m-m-m-m-my divination. I learned that through divination. Hideaki: For frickin' real?! Dang, that stuff is crazy! I always thought it was kinda bogus, to be honest... Never thought you could legit figure out stuff like that.  Wakana: She has a pretty high accuracy rating, or so the girls say.  Shuuji: ...Oh, really? That's neat.  Nene: Umm, if you want to, Hoshina-kun... I could do one for you. Would that be something you're interested in? Wakana, Hideaki: ...... Shuuji: You mean... an actual prediction? Nene: Yes. So, do you want to? Is there maybe something that's been bothering you ever since you were a small child? Shuuji: Nnh―――! Nene: With things like those, it always feels better to talk about it with another person, so if you feel up to it, you're welcome to stop by the clubroom at any time.  Shuuji: ...... Nene: Nothing in particular. I was only proposing a common scenario. There wasn't any deeper meaning to it. Shuuji: Okay, then... Wakana: Did you see something with your divination about him? Nene: You could say so. Nene's Classmate B: Ayachi-saaan! I was gonna ask you something about our math class later on today; could you help me? It's my turn to get called on today. Nene: Ah, sure. Of course. Nene's Classmate B: You're the best! Thanks so much! Nene: Alright then. I'll see you three later.  Wakana: Yeah, bye. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: What can I say... Hideaki: Just make up a problem if you don't got one, sheesh. Just go for the divination so you can spend time alone with her. Man, I can't believe you.  Shuuji: She's helping people out of the kindness of her heart. It just feels wrong to go there with ulterior motives.  Wakana: It's funny you say that, Kaidou, because I didn't see her inviting you. She probably realized how much of a sleazeball you are.  Hideaki: ...Kinda hurts when you say that so bluntly, you know. Shuuji: Ngh―――! Wakana: Hoshina? What're you making that face for? Everything alright?  Shuuji: Ah, yeah. It's nothing.  Hideaki: Yeah, we better.  Wakana: Oh right, there's something I need you guys to do for me. It's about Ayachi-san's club she mentioned.  Shuuji: Ah, didn't she mention she didn't want us spreading it around thoughtlessly? Wakana: Yeah, that's what I was gonna say. Wakana: She's the only one in there, so if word gets out to the whole school, she'll end up swarmed by guys with ulterior motives.   Shuuji: Oh, so guys like Kaidou. Gotcha.  Hideaki: ...Well, I won't deny it. Wakana: So, like I was saying, it'd be a real problem for Ayachi-san if animals like that start barging in her clubroom. Wakana: Plus, like, it'd scare off girls actually wanting to go there for advice, right? So try to keep it to yourself as much as possible.  Hideaki: Sure thing. I won't tell a soul. Hideaki: Means I got an edge over those other guys anyways! Hideaki: Okay, got it. Shuuji: I'll keep my mouth shut too. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: It's no big deal. Girl: Thank you so much. Alright then, good luck♪ Shuuji: See you later.  Hideaki: So you still got roped into doing this, eh? Shuuji: I already said yes, so I can't just change my answer on her now.  Hideaki: Well... I guess that's fair enough. Shuuji: Besides, it's all simple stuff. Don't worry about it.  Hideaki: ...If you say so. But if you ever need me to do something, just hit me up. Wakana: Hoshina, are you sure you don't want any help? Hideaki: Hmm. I guess I can help too, if you want.  Shuuji: I appreciate it, you guys, but I'll really be fine.  Shuuji: You probably have better things to do with your time, anyways.  Wakana: ...Knew you'd say that. Hideaki: You never wanna take help when you get yourself into these situations.  Shuuji: D-Do I? I don't purposely try to... Besides, isn't it only natural for me to not want my friends taking time out of their schedule to help me do something I agreed to? Shuuji: All I'm honestly doing today is entering some data into their database. It's better that I do it alone, if anything.  Shuuji: But, if something like this does happen again, I will come to you guys. Hideaki: You should try not to get into these situations in the first place.  Shuuji: Ah, right. I'll keep that in mind.  Wakana: I'm sure you will. And next time a girl comes up to with something, you'll be too chicken to say no, and then we'll go through this whole thing again. Shuuji: Well, not that I have any problem to come to her with... Shuuji: I've been told to come here and register some new books into the library catalog. Shuuji: Sure.  Committee Girl: Huh? Shuuji: I doubt anyone is gonna come by this late anyway, and I can return the key to the faculty room myself once I'm done. Committee Girl: But... I'm on duty and you aren't even a Committee member... Shuuji: I'm a Library Committee substitute today. It'll be alright. Probably. Committee Girl: You think so? Committee Girl: ...I guess you're right. Okay, here's the key. I'll finish everything else, so just make sure you lock the library once you're done.  Shuuji: Will do. Committee Girl: Could you also turn off the computer before you leave? Shuuji: Oh yeah, of course. I won't forget. Take care on your way home.  Committee Girl: Yeah, thanks! You too. Bye. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Mhh... Now I feel a little bit better. Shuuji: ...That was cringe.  Wakana: \"Hoshina, are you sure you don't want any help?\" Hideaki: \"Hmm. I guess I can help too, if you want. \" Shuuji: They were kind enough to offer... Why didn't I take it? Shuuji: ...If I keep this up, I wouldn't blame them for not wanting to be my friend anymore.  Shuuji: Wait, I can't just bank on something like that happening. I need to put in effort myself. Shuuji: I really need to fundamentally change who I am.  Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: I think I'll come back here on another date. Checking out what kinds of books they have here could be a good way to kill some time.  Nene: I thought this was the right day... Nene: You said you'd fall in love with me... You promised me all I had to do was find you... So why is none of this working out?! Shuuji: Mh... Fuah, aaaaah... Shuuji: Morning. Hideaki: Oh, hey there.  Hideaki: How'd it go yesterday? Shuuji: Pretty swimmingly. I was done with everything before sunset. Akita: Good morning, Hoshina-kun! Shuuji: Oh yeah, hey, Akita-san. Akita: Really sorry about yesterday. I mean, having you fill in for me on such short notice. How'd it go? Shuuji: Great. Finished everything without a hitch, so you're all set. Akita: Wow, really?! Thanks so much! You're the best. Shuuji: Did everything go alright at your thing yesterday? Akita: Yep, you bet! Akita: Ah, right! I baked some cookies as thanks. Here you go! I baked them myself, too! Shuuji: Oh, thanks.  Hideaki: Listen, Akita. I know Shuuji's partly to blame for being such a sucker, but you gotta do these things yourself.  Akita: I know, I know. I apologized to him for it.  Akita: But yesterday really was an important, special day! It was super rare! Like hospital rare! Shuuji: \"Hospital rare\"? Is that your way of saying there was a physician at the mixer? That's pretty impressive. Akita: Ah... Akita: Mixer? What's that? I have no idea what you mean, eheh! Anyway, thanks a lot for yesterday☆ Shuuji: Guess that hospital whatever mixer went great for her.  Hideaki: You could've given her more shit for it, in my opinion... But I didn't like that sarcastic comment you threw in.  Shuuji: I can at least do that. I just hope it teaches her a lesson... But hey, I got some cookies out of it this time, so it's all good. Hideaki: Isn't that just her blatantly showing off, like \"I'm such an amazing, domestic girl☆\"? Shuuji: Doesn't change how happy I was. Hideaki: I can relate. You know they're playing you, but you just can't help but feel glad. Wakana: Morning! Shuuji: Ah, morning. Hideaki: Hey, Wakana-chan. Wakana: What are you guys talking about? Shuuji: The simple-minded nature of men. Wakana: What? Oh, don't tell me... You were talking about naughty topics you don't want a girl to hear about? Hideaki: We guys have our own secrets too. But it wasn't anything sex-related.  Wakana: I don't buy it. Wakana: Hm? What's up? Schoolgirl D: You got someone here to see you! Wakana: Who? Nene: ...... Nene: I need to talk with you about something... Do you have a moment? Wakana: Sure, but what's up? Is it about my part-time job? Nene: No, it's entirely unrelated to that to that... I have a favor I want to ask of you. Wakana: Sure... If it's something I can help you with... Nene: Okay then, umm... Come with me. Wakana: Huh? But the bell's about to― Nene: I promise it won't take long at all.  Shuuji: No idea. Maybe some girls only conversation? Hideaki: Man... That gets me kinda excited. Think it's about a crush? Shuuji: I don't think they're THAT good of friends... Shuuji: Who knows.  Hideaki: What'd she want?  Wakana: Oh, yeah. She just wanted me to relay a message to someone.  Hideaki: Huh? Why would she go to you for that? Wakana: Sorry, I promised not to tell anyone about it. I also can't tell you who the person is.  Hideaki: ...You're just getting me more curious.  Wakana: Oh, look, there's the bell. That means we're done talking here.  Hideaki: Well, shucks. Wakana: Here. For you.  Shuuji: What's this... An envelope? Is there a letter inside? "

Meguru: Besides, unlike you, I can't tell anything at all... Meguru: That's why I keep agonizing over this... Meguru: About how you think of me. Meguru: About whether you feel the same as I do. Meguru: About how I should convey my feelings. Meguru: I just... Meguru: Aah! Meguru: I love you too! Meguru: You said it! You finally said it, Senpai!

            "Nene: Good morning. Shuuji: I was just captivated by your smile. Nene: What? Ah... urk... There you go again, teasing and embarrassing me... Shuuji: Hey, it was the truth. Shuuji: Right. So any ideas? Any place you wanna go, or any things you wanna do?  Nene: Let's see... umm. Shuuji: It can be anything you want.  Shuuji: Ya? Nene: Yakiniku! I want to go to a yakiniku buffet. Shuuji: ...You wanna go to a buffet? Nene: Yes. I've always wanted to try going to those once... Is it too weird? I know, a buffet on our first date is a little... Shuuji: Nah, I don't mind going. It was just a little unexpected. Nene: Hmm... Karaoke, bowling, oh and also a photo booth... Shuuji: Quite a lot there.  Nene: I'm sorry. They're all things I've been interested in doing, but I could never work up the courage to go alone... Shuuji: Nothing wrong with that. It actually makes me happy that I get to do all these things with you.  Shuuji: Aight, we're gonna do all of 'em! We'll have some yakiniku, go to a karaoke bar, bowl, and take some pictures at a photo booth. Shuuji: Everything you want to do, Nene. Nene: ...Thanks! Shuuji: You did pretty good for your first time.  Nene: Umm, if it's alright by you... Could I make you one as well? Shuuji: Sure. Actually, I'd love that.  Nene: Okay! I'll be right back! Shuuji: Thanks, Nene. Shuuji: Dang, this is good! I just knew the ice cream cone you made me would be extra good. Nene: Thank you for the compliment. But I think the taste of the ice cream is the same no matter who makes it. Shuuji: That's how it should be, yeah. Which is why it's all the more a mystery that mine tastes so good.  Shuuji: Hm? What's wrong? Nene: You got a little bit of it on your face.  Shuuji: Where? Shuuji: Okay, thanks. Nene: You're welcome... Alright then, umm, umm... Nene: ...*lick* Shuuji: Nnh―――?! Nene: O-Okay. That was... all of it. Shuuji: Nene, did you just... Shuuji: Yeah, it's all good. Shocked me a bit, but I don't mind. I kind of enjoyed it, actually. Shuuji: So, um... yeah... Nene: ...... Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Hmm... You don't wanna do it again? Nene: Gosh... You'd better not move.  Nene: Mhhhh... *lick* Okay, that's all of it. Shuuji: ...... Nene: Th-That was the last time I'm doing it, though, okay? There are people around us... And it's way too embarrassing.  Nene: I wouldn't mind... But there's a place I'd like to go to. Would you care to come with me? Shuuji: Sure, but where are we going? Nene: Don't worry, it's somewhere close by. We can get there by foot. Shuuji: Okay. Shuuji: Wait... Shuuji: Our school? What are we doing here? Nene: Come on, we're not there yet! Shuuji: Ah, wait up. Nene? Nene: Of course. Some of our sports teams are having competitions fairly soon, so the school is remaining open on weekends for the rest of the year.  Shuuji: Oh, wow. I didn't know that.  Nene: But we might want to make sure nobody sees us. We could get in trouble since we don't have on our uniforms.  Shuuji: Got it. Shuuji: Hmm... I'd say either the locker or on the whiteboard.  Nene: Ah, I was thinking of the locker too. Since we both agree on it, I say we do that. And, perfect.  Nene: Looking at this really makes us seem like a true couple.  Shuuji: Huh? I mean, we've done plenty of things couples do thus far in our relationship... Nene: Yes, I do admit we've been pretty intimate... I know you mentioned it one time, how sometimes we seem more like a husband and wife.  Shuuji: Ah, right. I remember that.  Nene: It goes without saying that I've wholeheartedly enjoyed everything we've done in our relationship thus far... But new things can also be fun. Shuuji: Yeah, I completely agree. Nene: Perfect... I've had so much fun on our date that my mind is out of ideas. I'm completely satisfied.  Shuuji: Me too. I had so much fun with you today it was crazy.  Shuuji: But, the day's not quite over yet.  Nene: ...... Shuuji: You ready? Let's go eat dinner somewhere. Nene: I'd love to, but there's one problem... It seems my time is up. Nene: I would've wanted to eat dinner with you, too... If possible... But I don't think we have enough time left for that.  Shuuji: ...Oh. Nene: I want you to know, I truly had fun on our date. Getting to spend my day with you filled me with so much happiness. Nene: There are countless more things that I would love to do with you... But I won't say that I have regrets. I'm happy.  Nene: ...... Shuuji: Nene? Nene: ...... Nene: After I've gone... There's a chance the hole in your heart may reopen. I have to retrieve them to prevent that from happening. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Alright. Nene: You're not surprised, or anything? Do you really want to go forward with this so readily? Shuuji: I love you more than the world, Nene. And I know that you love me just as much, if not more.  Shuuji: So if this is what you want, then I'll go along with it. It's something I wanted to do, anyways. I don't want to leave you with any regrets. Shuuji: Come on, Nene, don't frown like that. Give me that beautiful smile that I know and love you for. Nene: I've... really changed. Before I met you, all I could think about was my contract... There very well could've been a hole in my own heart, just like yours.  Nene: But I was able to change myself for the better.  Shuuji: So was I. Meeting you made such a difference for me, Nene.  Nene: I love the person I've become since then. Returning to my previous self... It's a very sad thought to me now.  Shuuji: It's the exact same for me. Before summer break, I wasn't even capable of smiling from the bottom of my heart. I know how important and precious it is to smile now, thanks to you.  Nene: I want to protect you, Shuuji-kun. Because of the gratitude I feel towards you. Of course, I know I have no right to say that when I'm about to cause you so much pain.  Nene: It's selfish of me to force my own wishes on you, like I have some authority over you. I know I should feel ashamed of that.  Nene: But still, I want to see you smile. I want you to be happy even after I leave.  Nene: ...I'm so, so sorry for doing this. But I... want you to know... Nene: I truly love you from the bottom of my heart. Shuuji: I truly love you from the bottom of my heart too, Nene. Shuuji: You promised me you'd be smiling when you left.  Nene: ...... Shuuji: If you cried during our final moment together I'm sure you'd end up regretting it.  Shuuji: And just a minute or two ago, you said you didn't want any regrets. You'd ruin it all by doing something like that now.  Nene: This really is it... Shuuji: ...I guess so. Shuuji: That's enough.  Shuuji: I already know how you feel. And likewise, you know how I feel. Shuuji: So if you want to give me anything, give me a smile, Nene. And I'll give you one too, to wish you luck on your journey.  Nene: ...... Nene: Thank you. I'll find happiness, I promise. And furthermore, I'll find you, and we'll be happy together.  Shuuji: I know you can do it.  Nene: It will happen. You have my word on it.  Shuuji: Okay. Nene: It may take a bit of time... But I swear to you that I'll find you and make you happy. We'll both smile again, together, from the bottom of our hearts. Shuuji: Ah――! Nene: ...See you soon. "

Oh, and I guess yours too, if you're gonna be there anyway. Shuuji: ...Do you enjoy hurting your students' feelings? Kanae: I do when you give me such good reactions. Shuuji: ...... Kanae: Well, all jokes aside, I'll be dropping by your clubroom after school if Ayachi isn't going home. Shuuji: Okay. I'll let her know. Kanae: Yeah, please do. Wakana: Oh, he's back. Hideaki: What's wrong? Are you okay? It's not often you skip class. Shuuji: I wasn't skipping. I was sick, okay? Hideaki: You were walking and talking just fine though. Who are you kidding? Wakana: Right. You definitely didn't look sick to me. Shuuji: It's not good to make assumptions like that, guys. Wakana: Well, I doubt you skipped just for the hell of it. I'm sure you had a good reason. Hideaki: Though, taking Ayachi-san along wasn't the greatest idea, was it? Shuuji: ...Yeah, no kidding. Shuuji: ...That's really not the case. Wakana: Speaking of, where is she? She hasn't come back yet. Shuuji: Oh, about that... It seems she felt even sicker than me, so she decided to rest for a little bit. Hideaki: Yeah, there was something off about her. Wakana: Are you alright? I mean the both of you. Shuuji: Yeah, I feel fine again already. It seems the nap I took in the infirmary helped. Maybe I haven't been getting enough sleep. Wakana: Ahh, yeah, I know what you mean. You can get headaches from not sleeping enough. That's the worst feeling. It can make you feel really sick. Shuuji: Anyway, Ayachi-san said she'll be fine after a little bit of rest. I don't think there's anything to worry about. Hideaki: That's good. Shuuji: Ah, my textbooks from earlier are still out. I should put them away. Shuuji: Work again? You've been working pretty hard. Wakana: Yeah, thanks. I don't mind it though. It's pretty fun working there. Wakana: And even better, I'll be able to get some sick accessories for my guitar. Uhehe. Wakana: I know you're busy with your club, but stop by again sometime. I'll give you an extra special treat if you do. Shuuji: A \"special treat\"...? That's got a pretty dirty ring to it, you know. Shuuji: So, what're you planning? Wakana: My grip strength has gone up quite a bit since I've started playing, so how would you like my patented iron claw technique? Shuuji: Yaaay! That'd be the best freebie ever! Wakana: You say that like I'm usually not those things... Wakana: But okay. I'll be waiting for you. See you. Shuuji: Say hi to Souma-san for me. Nene: Oh yes, thank you. I'm fine now... Schoolgirl C: I see. Glad to hear that. Shuuji: Umm, Ayachi-san... Err, about earlier― Nene: %130;Huh? What did you just say? Shuuji: Anyway, will we have club today? Shuuji: Hisashima-sensei said she wanted to come by the clubroom and ask us for our help. Nene: Hisashima-sensei said that? Shuuji: Yeah, she did. So let's head to the clubroob. Nene: Umm! P-Please go on ahead. I can't, umm, move very fast today. Shuuji: Huh? Do you feel sick?! Or are you hurt somewhere?! Nene: No, nothing of the sort. Umm... It's kinda drafty today. Shuuji: Drafty? Nene: Yes, drafty... Nene: Wh-What I'm trying to say is that I'm wearing nothing under my skirt! I'm not wearing any panties, so it feels drafty... Nene: ...... Nene: ...Oh, I can't take this anymore! I want to cry... I'm going home. Shuuji: Wait, calm down. What about our club? Nene: That's your fault for shaming and teasing me! Shuuji: But I haven't done anything! Nene: You forced me into explaining that I'm not wearing any panties! Shuuji: You just went and told me that on your own! Though, I guess I may have sounded like I wanted to know. Sorry. I'm really sorry. So please calm down now. Shuuji: We have Hisashima-sensei coming over today, so you need to come to club if possible. Nene: ...... Nene: You're right. I'm sorry... I lost my head a little. Shuuji: Don't worry about it. Shuuji: But man, it would be great if we had some kind of secret weapon or something to help calm you down whenever you have one of those fits. Nene: A secret weapon? Shuuji: I'm just saying. I don't have any idea what that could be myself. Nene: A secret weapon... I'll give it some thought. Nene: Y-Yes. Umm... I'd feel a bit better if no one was around me while I walked... Shuuji: You really don't have it easy, do you? Nene: Y-Yes? Shuuji: Couldn't you just wear your P.E. shorts beneath your skirt? We had P.E. today, right? Nene: ...... Nene: Ah! Nene: Y-You should have said that sooner! I knew it. You really are having fun at my expense... You're so mean. Shuuji: I'm not! Nene: No, they don't. Most teachers don't know about the OC's actual activities, just like with the students. Meguru: So then, that makes this pretty unusual, yeah? Shuuji: I'm kinda scared. I wonder what this is going to be about. "

Shuuji: Well, we still have 10 minutes before it's time. She shouldn't be too long... Kawakami: Honestly, I expected you to be dead last, Inaba. Meguru: Mgh. Judging people on appearances is a little rude, you know.  Shuuji: Nah, you're not late or anything. Don't worry about it.  Nene: Sorry... It took me a bit of time to get myself ready... Shuuji: Oh, I see. But hey, the outfit looks great on you. Super cute, Nene. Nene: Th-Thank you... Hehehe. Kawakami: ...Is the difference really that noticeable? I mean, sure, she looks cute like she always does, but I dunno... Meguru: What are you saying? The difference is HUGE. Her hair ends are trimmed, and her cuticles also look perfect. I'd totally bet she's been to a beauty salon.  Kawakami: You serious...? I can't see squat. Heck, like, is it even possible to tell differences in something like trimmed hair ends? Meguru: Actually, popular guys notice these things.  Kawakami: Oh... No wonder Hoshina-senpai did. It's crazy that he's so attentive to detail. Meguru: Hmm... I don't know about that. In his case, I feel like it isn't visual awareness that led to it, but a little thing called \"situational\" awareness.  Shuuji: ...... Meguru: But you better keep in mind, complimenting for the sake of complimenting is a no-no. Kawakami: Ah, okay. Interesting.  Shuuji: ...... Nene: Yes. Kawakami: So where're you gonna be going? Shuuji: Hmm... I like the arcade. Meguru: An arcade for the first place? Very interesting choice. Kawakami: Umm, according to what I've read, arcades aren't a good spot to go on a date... Shuuji: That's just in general. With everything, it really just depends on you and your partner, and your tastes and interests.  Nene: I quite like arcades myself. I've never actually been to one proper, though, so I'm fairly excited for this.  Meguru: Whoa, really?  Nene: I have entered one before, but we were short on time then, so all we did was go to the photo booth. Kawakami: Ohh, okay... Kawakami: So it's the same with dates as it is with shaggin'! Can't go by the books! Shuuji: Yes, but PLEASE don't say that out loud, for Christ's sake!! Meguru: Shaggin? What does that mean? Kawakami: Nah, it's nothing! Just forget I said that, Inaba. Meguru: Hmm. Something smells veeery fishy.  Shuuji: Come on, we're going.  Kawakami: Ah, we're gonna tail you guys from a short distance.  Nene: Oh, you are? I was under the impression we would all stay together... Meguru: Oh no, that'd make things way too awkward for you two.  Kawakami: I wanna know how couples act naturally, is all. If we constantly interrupted y'all with comments and whatnot, that'd pretty much defeat the purpose. Kawakami: Just forget about us two and do your thing. Go on, go on. Shuuji: It's kind of hard to do that when we know we're being watched... Shuuji: No point in dawdling around here forever. Let's go, Nene. Nene: Yes, I'm ready.  Shuuji: If you want, sure. Do you like them? Nene: I do like them, yes... But more so, I thought it would be nice to have some sort of physical object to remember our dates by.  Nene: Do you remember how you suggested we get a cork board before?  Shuuji: So that's what you want... Shuuji: Alright, then! In that case, I'm gonna get you a plushie as a present today. Nene: A plushie? Shuuji: Yep. One from those claw machines. And we can even include it in the picture we take! Nene: Oh, that's a fantastic idea. I'd love that. If you can get one, that'd be wonderful. Shuuji: Almost there, almost there... And, now! Nene: Please don't drop it, please don't drop it... Shuuji: I guess there has to be a way... "

Shuuji: She said she'd come back after a short rest. Kanae: I hope so. There's actually a favor I want to ask of the Occult Club, so I was hoping I could see you after school. Shuuji: You?

Teachers shouldn't normally rely on their students like this, but the circumstances are pretty unusual here. Kanae: There is something I would really like Ayachi's help with. Oh, and I guess yours too, if you're gonna be there anyway. Shuuji: ...Do you enjoy hurting your students' feelings? Kanae: I do when you give me such good reactions. Shuuji: ......

Hideaki: What's wrong? Are you okay? It's not often you skip class. Shuuji: I wasn't skipping. I was sick, okay? Hideaki: You were walking and talking just fine though. Who are you kidding? Wakana: Right. You definitely didn't look sick to me. Shuuji: It's not good to make assumptions like that, guys. Wakana: Well, I doubt you skipped just for the hell of it. I'm sure you had a good reason. Hideaki: Though, taking Ayachi-san along wasn't the greatest idea, was it? Shuuji: ...Yeah, no kidding. Shuuji: ...That's really not the case. Wakana: Speaking of, where is she? She hasn't come back yet. Shuuji: Oh, about that... It seems she felt even sicker than me, so she decided to rest for a little bit. Hideaki: Yeah, there was something off about her. Wakana: Are you alright? I mean the both of you. Shuuji: Yeah, I feel fine again already. It seems the nap I took in the infirmary helped. Maybe I haven't been getting enough sleep. Wakana: Ahh, yeah, I know what you mean. You can get headaches from not sleeping enough. That's the worst feeling. It can make you feel really sick. Shuuji: Anyway, Ayachi-san said she'll be fine after a little bit of rest. I don't think there's anything to worry about. Hideaki: That's good. Shuuji: Ah, my textbooks from earlier are still out. I should put them away. Shuuji: Work again? You've been working pretty hard. Wakana: Yeah, thanks. I don't mind it though. It's pretty fun working there.

            "Shuuji: Thank you so much, Ayachi-san. Nene: ―――! Nene: I-It's nothing. Also, please don't look at me like that! Please, please, pretty please!! Shuuji: Huh? Why not? Nene: If you smile at me like that, I'll... I'll end up...!! Nene: I-I'll be right back. I have to go to the restroom! Shuuji: Ah, okay. I'll be here.  Shuuji: ...... Student: Umm... Excuse me. I heard that I could come here and get help with my problems, and I was wondering if that's true.  Meguru: Yep! We'll help you! Student: Oh, perfect! There was actually something I wanted to ask you all for help with. Touko: Come on inside and make yourself at home. Is that alright, Ayachi-san? Nene: Yes, of course. Please come in. We'll be glad to help you in whatever way we can.  Student: Oh, thank you so much! Excuse me.  Student: O-Oh, no! I'd actually prefer you to be here! You might be able to give me some good advice on this. Shuuji: Oh, really?  Student: Well, the thing is... like... Student: As you can see, I have quite the feminine body. And I also believe I'm pretty cute besides that.  Nene, Tsumugi, Touko, Shuuji: ...... Meguru: ...Say what? Nene: Umm, pardon me for interrupting, but do you mind if I ask you a question? Student: Sure. What is it?  Nene: I'm having a bit of trouble seeing where the problem lies, so let me ask you again... You really are seeking advice, yes? Student: What are you saying?! I have a legit problem on my hands here!! Nene: I-I'm sorry... Touko: Well, let's just calm down, guys. Wait until she's done, okay? Nene: You're right. I shouldn't have interrupted you there. Please continue. Student: No worries! So back to what I was saying.  Student: So... Huh? What was I talking about again? Tsumugi: Something about how you've never had problems getting boyfriends... Student: Ah, right! I'm cute, sexy, and I have a great body, so I can get a boyfriend pretty much at the drop of a hat.  Shuuji: Wow, she really emphasized that part... Shuuji: Umm... *cough* *cough* So continuing on? Student: Right. So I'm currently dating a guy right now, yeah? He's just so cute and adorable, and I want to smother him in affection. He almost seems like a little boy.  Shuuji: Okay... And? Student: But I'm not sure how he feels... I don't know if he loves me the same way... Shuuji: So, basically, let me get this right... You want to figure out how much he loves you? Student: Yeah, that's exactly it.  Touko: Umm, can I shoot you a quick question?  Student: Yeah, that's fine.  Touko: If you're saying this, does that mean you have reason to doubt the sincerity of his feelings?  Student: ...Unfortunately. It's been worrying me and stressing me out so much that I can't even get a good night's sleep anymore. My skin's going to be ruined if this keeps up. Nene: Would you feel comfortable sharing with us what that thing was? Student: Ah, sure. So, the thing is, he, umm... Student: Everytime we go on a date, he wants to do it afterward. Meguru, Tsumugi, Touko: ...What? Nene: ...Umm, sorry, but it's not anything like him acting distant, or cheating on you, or anything similar? Student: No, not at all! Maa-kun is so nice to me! Student: He treats me well, so I don't have any problems with that. But, well... Whenever it's date day, he always gets horny at the end and wants to have sex. Student: Do you think he really loves me?! I'm worried he might just be dating me for my sexy, bodacious body! Meguru: ...Why does she feel the need to add like two to three adjectives everytime she mentions her body.  Shuuji: Hey, they're all accurate.  Meguru: Kgh...!! Tsumugi: So, uh... Could you possibly tell us why you decided to come to us of all people for this problem of yours?  Student: Huh? Well, I heard I could get advice from Ayachi-san and Togakushi-senpai here.  Student: And both of them seem super experienced with stuff like this. I figured they'd have an answer for me in no time. Touko: I appreciate the compliment, but I don't know what to tell you. I don't have a lick of experience in that department. Student: Wow, really? I guess that just means you're so charming that you've never had any reason to doubt the guys you've been with! Amazing!! Touko: No, that's not what I meant! I've never actually had a boyfriend.  Student: What?! That's so unexpected!! Touko: Well, I didn't have time for boys. I was always too busy with my Student Council work. Well, what about you, Ayachi-san? Nene: I-I wouldn't be able to help with that either! Like, at all. Nene: Besides... I'm not one to look up to when it comes to romance. I'm even having related problems myself right now... Ah, err, forget I said that. Tsumugi: Yeah, I don't think I'd be much help either.  Shuuji: Huh? Me? Meguru: Yeah, you. None of us girls have any relationship experience, so our only option is to hear from the other side.  Shuuji: ...I guess that's the logical conclusion. Shuuji: Would he be after you so badly if he didn't love you? Student: Well, I've had previous boyfriends who wanted to do it all the time too, and it turned out they were only in it for the sex!! Shuuji: Man, what the hell do I know!! Shuuji: You mentioned you were going on dates. Are those proper dates? Shuuji: You do actual things, right? Not just, like... go straight to a love hotel, or wherever the spot is... and start going at it.  Student: Oh, of course we do! Maa-kun is so sweet, so we always go where I want to. Shuuji: He seems to be a fairly considerate guy, so I'd say he does love you.  Shuuji: It's hard for me to really determine anything more, since that depends on what kind of guy he is.  Student: Would you like to meet him, then? I really want to hear your opinion after you get to know him!!  Shuuji: %130;Are you serious?! Student: If you don't want to... I could have someone else from here do it.  Touko: I'm not sure that'd be a good idea. It might be best for a guy to evaluate him. Touko: If he was surrounded by girls, he might be too nervous to say anything. He'd probably feel more comfortable sharing his feelings with another guy.  Meguru: You have a point. Would be a problem if he entered defense mode. Tsumugi: I don't anyone's asked this, but does your boyfriend go here too? Student: Yeah, he does! He's a first-year like me, but we're in different classes. His name is Mikawa Masahiro. Meguru: Mikawa-kun? Wow... Talk about unexpected... Nene: Do you know him, Inaba-san? Meguru: Yup. He's in my class. He's cute and has a baby face, like she described, but wow... He's the last person I'd expect to be out having sex... Guess you really can't judge people by appearances. Student: Oh, let me tell you! He's cute as a button, but boy does he fuck like a tiger. Three rounds is his bare minimum, plus his dick is super thick. I almost pass out just from― Meguru: T-T-T-T-T-T-Too much information!! Student: Oh, sorry. I thought you were curious.  "

I know you can do it, Ayachi-san! Nene: Thank you for the compliment, but I really can't. I'm not good at being in front of crowds. Schoolgirl D: *sigh* Okay, I guess there's no changing your mind. Aww man, we could've hit it big... Schoolgirl D: Oh! But if you ever change your mind and wanna step onto the stage again, talk to me first! You gotta! Nene: *sigh* Very well.

Touko: Now, now, this just shows how wonderfully your band played, doesn't it? Nene: Yes, and that's an honor, and I'm truly grateful, but... it's rather draining...

Let's call it a day so you can take it easy. Nene: ...Very well. Thank you for looking out for me. Touko: Helping people is important, but you're not going to be able to help anyone if you get sick.

Touko: Oh my, what do you mean? I only made a simple observation. Shuuji: You know what you said, and you clearly did it on purpose. Touko: Mufufu. You're blushing, you know? Shuuji: I'm not used to stuff like this... Go easy on me, please. Touko: Okay, my bad. Well, it's getting late, so how about we start locking up? Shuuji: Yeah, let's. Shuuji: But, before that... Could I have a moment? Touko: Of course. There's no rush. Oh, have you decided to talk to me at last? Shuuji: It's more of a request, I guess? Touko: You need something from me? Touko: Oh, is this about your reward? Decided what you wanted, have you? Go on then, let's hear it. Touko: Please, be honest with me. How can I be of service? Shuuji: I'd just like to talk for a minute if you don't mind. Touko: You want to talk? But isn't that what we're doing right now? Or do you mean you want to talk about sex? Like pillow talk? Oh my, you naughty boy. Shuuji: Could you please cut it out with the dirty jokes? Shuuji: I don't want any kind of special conversation. Certainly not one about sex. I just want us to talk normally so I can learn more about you. Shuuji: I mean, yes, there is a reason I want to talk to you, but we don't have to talk about anything specific... A normal conversation will do just fine, really. Touko: You're really serious about this. My bad. I just went and poked fun at you like normal. Shuuji: No, it's fine. I mean, I know this is a bit out of the blue. Touko: What's this about, though? Why do you want to know more about me? Shuuji: Well, you see, errm... There's no big reason behind it. Shuuji: It's just, we're in the same club, but I barely know anything about you. When I realized that, it started to bother me and made me want to do something about it. Touko: Oh, I see. Shuuji: So I just thought we could hang out together a little, or something. Shuuji: So... is that a no, then? Touko: Chatting itself isn't a problem. I don't mind doing that. Shuuji: Oh, well, that's good... Touko: Well, chatting a little isn't much of a reward, is it? It's just a normal, everyday thing. Touko: So it doesn't feel right. Hmm... Oh, I know. Let's go somewhere on our next day off, just the two of us, and talk there. Shuuji: Huh? Just the two of us? Touko: Yeah, that's right. That'll make it nice and easy for us to talk, won't it? Shuuji: D-Do you mean like... Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Yeah, sounds great. Touko: It's settled, then! Your reward for doing a good job with the Halloween party is a date with me. I sound a bit arrogant, putting it that way. Ahaha. Shuuji: N-No, I don't think you did at all. Thank you very much, Senpai. Touko: No problem. Well then, I'm looking forward to our date. Shuuji: I-I'm looking forward to it too. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: A date with Togakushi-senpai... Shuuji: A date... A date, huh? Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Do I even have any good date clothes?! Hideaki: Yo! Shuuji: Hey. Hideaki: What're you doing here so early? Shuuji: Just thinking about things. Hideaki: If something's bothering you, why not go talk to your friends at the OC? Shuuji: If it was a normal problem, I would. Shuuji: But this is a matter of pride. I can't talk to girls about this. Hideaki: Oho. This sounds interesting―no, I dare say fascinating. Hideaki: Well, we're both men here. You can talk to me about it! Shuuji: Huh? With you? Kaidou...? Hideaki: What's with that reaction? Don't talk smack until you try! I mean, the drum thing worked out, didn't it? Shuuji: That's true. Shuuji: You're being awfully nice today. Hideaki: That's 'cause it looks like something's really bothering you. And now I wanna know what it is. Shuuji: You're really enjoying this, huh? Hideaki: Kinda? But I'm pretty worried too. I'm not gonna laugh at you, I swear. I'll just give you my opinion. Shuuji: The whole reason I'm hesitant is that I know you'll laugh at me. Hideaki: A date, huh? I see, hmm... Hideaki: ...... Hideaki: Pfft, ahahahaha! Even middle schoolers don't worry about that nowadays! Ahahahaha! Shuuji: I thought you weren't gonna laugh! Hideaki: Sorry, my bad. Couldn't help it. Just didn't expect you to be worrying about a date. Shuuji: I think a lot of people worry about dates, actually. Hideaki: I went out and bought new clothes and everything for it. But I was wearing stuff I wasn't used to, so it went horribly. Shuuji: So, do you think I should dress up properly for a date? Hideaki: I dunno. Like, obviously you have to pay attention to your looks, but... I don't think you need to dress fancy or anything. Hideaki: Especially in your case, Shuuji. It's not like you're going on an actual date, right? So the rules for a normal date don't apply. Shuuji: Yeah... You're right. "

Wakana: If I had to guess, maybe he's a hardcore masochist? Shuuji: That's a rather extreme assumption. Hideaki: A hardcore masochist?! I see. So you've been taking on all this work in order to get turned on at school... I never would've expected it... Hideaki: You should've told me we were comrades! Shuuji: Keep your fetishes to yourself, dude! You're freaking me out! Wakana: Huh? You mean having girls work you like a dog DOESN'T turn you on? Shuuji: It really stings to see you so genuinely confused by that. Shuuji: And really, girls shouldn't talk about fetishes in the broad daylight. Wakana: What kind of sexist BS is this? Girls are allowed to talk about sex too. Shuuji: Sure, but usually you keep that sort of talk between girls. Shuuji: You got the hots for me or something? Wakana: Hahaha. Nice joke. I know you don't mean that. Hideaki: Though, it is true that girls talking about that stuff can give us guys the wrong idea. Wakana: Well, we only do so around guys we have no interest in. It's just a normal way to make conversation. Don't read too much into it. Shuuji: Either way, I don't get especially happy or anything when people work me. Hideaki: Yeah, sure. Says the guy who takes every request that comes his way. Shuuji: Well... It's just... Shuuji: Won't girls really like me if I never turn them down? Wakana: Ahahahaha! Not at all. If anything, it makes you look like a dumbass. Shuuji: Man, it stings when you say that so bluntly. Hideaki: You need to turn people down every once in a while. You'll get taken advantage of if you let them think you're so soft. Shuuji: You think I'll get taken advantage of...? Now you're just exaggerating. Wakana: I'm not. There are some nasty girls out there who will totally suck you dry with the way you are now. Shuuji: As if. You're clearly overthinking. Wakana: Tch, tch. You're being naive. Women can be much more calculating than you think. Hideaki: They'll make you pay for their food, for movie tickets, and even for accessories like purses! And all they'll give in return is a \"That was a fun way to kill some time. Thanks! See ya♪\" without any progress between the two of you. Hideaki: And then right after that, they'll suddenly call you and ask you to come pick them up because they missed the last train! For freaking real?! There's mischievous and then there's just plain evil! Wakana, Shuuji: ...... Hideaki: Ah?! S-Sorry guys, all my pent-up frustration just kinda exploded there. Shuuji: Looks like you've been through some serious shit, man. Hideaki: Yeah... I used to mess around a lot. But it's all in the past now. Wakana: That sounds like a real nasty girl you ran into. Shuuji: But getting used like that actually made you happy, didn't it? Hideaki: Well... Yeah, a little. Wakana: Ugh, are you grinning?! What a masochist... Terrifying. Shuuji: I seriously don't get how someone can feel pleasure from being treated so crappily. Hideaki: Hehe... That figures. You two are just greenhorns, after all. Shuuji: I'm not planning on ever becoming a masochist veteran. Shuuji: I wouldn't want that... Alright. I'll be more careful from now on. Hideaki: Have you guys forgotten that I'm right here? Hearing that really hurts, you know? Shuuji: I've got a question. Wakana: Go ahead, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: How do I avoid being taken advantage of while coming off as soft? Wakana: Coming off as soft is already a given? Shuuji: I just feel like I'd get on the girls' bad sides if I suddenly changed my whole attitude, which is scary in its own way. Wakana: Well, I guess that's possible. Hideaki: If you want an example of someone who's kind but doesn't get taken advantage of... Wakana: There's Ayachi-san. Hideaki: Oh, right. She's a perfect example. Girl: Yes? You called me? Hideaki: Whoa! A-Ayachi-san?! Ayachi-san: I'm sorry to have startled you. I just so happened to overhear my name when I was passing by. Ayachi-san: Is there something you need with me? Wakana: Oh, uh, don't worry about us. Your name just came up in our conversation. Hideaki: Yeah, we weren't gossiping about you or anything. Shuuji: Sorry if we offended you. Ayachi-san: Oh no, I'm not upset; I was just curious. Please don't mind me. Ayachi-san: Anyway, Kariya-san, about the thing from before... Wakana: Ah! Yeah, it's going great! That place you introduced me to is awesome! Things are going great thanks to you. Thanks so much! Ayachi-san: I'm happy to hear you like it there. Wakana: I'm really thankful to you. Ayachi-san: Please don't hesitate to visit the clubroom again should something else come up. Wakana: Thanks! I will! Schoolgirl B: Ah, Ayachi-saaan! Thanks for letting me borrow your notebook. You were a life-saver. And I have to say, the notes you took were super neat. You're awesome! Ayachi-san: Oh, it was no big deal. More importantly, are you feeling better now? Schoolgirl B: Yeah, I feel great! Ayachi-san: I'm glad to hear that. Is there anything else that is troubling you? Schoolgirl B: No, nothing at the moment. Ayachi-san: I'm willing to help you out or lend an ear to your worries anytime. It doesn't need to be school related; I'm happy to listen to private or other problems too. Schoolgirl B: Thanks. I'll be sure to stop by if something comes up. Ayachi-san: Yes, please do. Shuuji: Huh? Umm... What do you mean? Nene: I'd be glad to help if something should ever concern you. Shuuji: Oh, thanks. I'm happy for the offer, but there's nothing like that right now. Nene: Is that so? For some reason, I got the feeling that there's something worrying you... Shuuji: Y-Yeah...? Shuuji: Yeah...? Nene: No, I haven't... I just had a gut feeling about it. Wakana: Considering how many people you've helped, I think you're right to trust that feeling. Shuuji: What's that supposed to mean? The part about her helping people. Wakana: Oh, whoops... Right... Sorry, Ayachi-san! You're keeping this from the guys, aren't you? Nene: Oh, no, it's not that big of a secret, so don't worry about it. Nene: It would just be a problem for me if people showed up out of curiosity, so I'm asking that you only keep it to people who actually need help. Hideaki: ...? Did we overhear something we shouldn't have? Nene: It's nothing that big... I'm in the OC. Hideaki: OC? Shuuji: Um, you mean... the Occult Club? Nene: Yes. That's right. Shuuji: I didn't know we had one of those at this school. This is the first I'm hearing of it. Hideaki: Same here. And it's not just a circle, but an actual club? Nene: That's right. It's a club that's been around since before we entered this school. Though, I'm currently the only member. Nene: The Student Council has been on our case because of that... After all, the club doesn't do any sort of exhibitions or the like. Hideaki: So... do you research ghosts or something? Or maybe aliens? Nene: No, I am doing divination. \"Occult\" involves the entire spectrum of the supernatural. I am thankfully able to do as I please since I am the only member. Hideaki: By divination you mean, doing hand signs and being like \"And there we have it!\"? Shuuji: It's impressive how old that reference is. I don't think anyone is gonna get that. Wakana: You instantly recognizing it is just as impressive. I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. You guys are such geeks. Right, Ayachi-san? Nene: I obviously can't do Albino Snake Divination. Wakana: You know about it too?! Nene: Yeah, kind of, but I can only do tarot card reading. Divination is nothing more than a hobby for me, after all. Wakana: Anyway, she's also offering counseling there. Nene: It's really just part of the divination I'm doing. It hardly deserves to be called \"counseling.\" Nene: But if you want, don't hesitate to come over to my clubroom anytime, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Oh, sure. Thanks. Schoolgirl A: Ayachi-saaan! I need your help with our classic Japanese homework! Nene: Oh, of course. I'll be right there. Nene: Okay then. I must excuse myself now. Hideaki: She's almost a little too perfect to be real. Hideaki: But anyway, people consult her for a lot of stuff, huh? I would've expected that to turn into a big rumor. Wakana: It's well-known among girls. It'd be a big problem for Ayachi-san if the guys found out and caused a commotion, though. Hideaki: Ah, is that so... Maybe I should pay her a visit too, and then... Ehee! Shuuji: Allow me to read your thoughts: \"Maybe I could get closer to her.\" Hideaki: Huh?! What?! Espers are real? And you're one of them?! Wakana: What're you talking about? You couldn't have been more obvious. You were practically oozing with sleaze. Shuuji: You're even drooling some. Hideaki: Really?! Oh, you're right! Shuuji: I'm guessing that the girls don't spread that rumor around because of how many guys like you there are. Wakana: That's right. You two better keep this to yourselves. Hideaki: Sure. You bet! Shuuji: So anyway, did you also consult her about something, Kariya? I mean, you just thanked her and all. Wakana: I did. I really want something, but I was worried because I didn't have the money for it. Shuuji: What do you want? Wakana: Well... A guitar. Hideaki: A guitar? Sure didn't expect that. Shuuji: You can play the guitar? Well, I guess you wouldn't want one if you couldn't. Wakana: Yeah, a little. Wakana: It's been a few years now, and so I'd like to finally get my own guitar. Shuuji: Huh. My only musical experience comes from music class, though that was ages ago. Hideaki: I could probably play a bit better than Shuuji, then. I had a phase where I was really into music, and so I tried my hand at the guitar. Wakana: Oh, really? That's unexpected. Hideaki: Well, that was a while ago. So? Since you're saving up money, you gonna get a good one? Wakana: Yeah, I'd like a decent one, at least. Though, the prices of musical instruments are pretty crazy. Shuuji: True. Especially vintage instruments. The amount those go for is just bonkers. Wakana: Dad told me to get one with my own money. Would it have killed him to give me at least some of the money for it? Shuuji: So, how did Ayachi-san help you with that? Wakana: She introduced me to a part-time job. Wakana: And now I'm going to finally reach my goal with my next paycheck, meaning I'll be getting my guitar really soon♪ Uhehe. Hideaki: A part-time job, huh? That's nice. Maybe I could have her introduce me to one as well? Wakana: Allow me to read your thoughts: \"Maybe then, I could get closer to her. I could even ask her out on a date to 'repay her' with my first paycheck!\" Hideaki: Is everyone I know a freaking esper?! Shuuji: Look, anyone could guess as much. The fact that she was right just means you're simple. Hideaki: Wh-Whatever! Who cares! Besides, as a guy, I can't let an opportunity to get to know a cute girl like her slip by! Wakana: Well, you have a point... I guess. Shuuji: I'm guessing all the other single guys out there are looking for opportunities too. Student 2: What was it about? I-I want to know... Damn, I'm so jealous of them. Student 3: Damn it... I wanna chat with her too. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Uh... It's nothing. Hideaki: Don't act like this is none of your business. You'd love to get closer with Ayachi-san too, right? Why not get a tarot reading from her? She invited you for one, after all. Shuuji: I dunno... I'll swing by and ask for one once something comes up. Hideaki: What a waste. Wakana: I feel like she wouldn't like it if he went there without a good reason. Hideaki: Huh?! Really? Wakana: Nobody likes a guy who clearly has ulterior motives, you know? Hideaki: Except when you're hot. Wakana: Well, too bad you aren't. Hideaki: Wow! How could you?! Wakana: I don't think girls like Ayachi-san are that shallow. What matters is if you're attractive on the inside, not the outside. Hideaki: I see. Wakana: Besides, people with great personalities wouldn't approach her like that in the first place. Hideaki: Ugh... I guess it's game, set and match for me. Shuuji: Guys, we better head back to class. Afternoon classes are about to start. Wakana: Oh, yeah. Right. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: (Phew...) Shuuji: It's cool. Don't worry about it. Girl: Thanks. Okay then, bye-bye♪ Shuuji: See you tomorrow. Hideaki: So you're still doing this, huh? Shuuji: For today, yeah. It wouldn't be right to turn her down now after I already told her I'd do it. Wakana: Yeah, fair enough. Hideaki: *sigh*... Okay, fine. Want me to give you a hand? Shuuji: Err... Shuuji: I appreciate the sentiment, but no thanks. Hideaki: Knew you'd say that. Wakana: Yeah, it was practically a given. Shuuji: What do you mean? Hideaki: You're a real lone wolf, dude. Shuuji: Okay, look. All I'm doing today is entering some data into their computer database, so I really don't need your help. Shuuji: I'll ask you for help for sure next time something like this happens. Wakana: Stubborn to the end, I see. Hideaki: There's not supposed to be a \"next time.\" You're supposed to turn them down instead. Shuuji: Yeah, yeah. I know. Hideaki: Looks like he's gonna keep on helping people after this. Wakana: That's just how he is. It's not something that can be fixed that easily. Wakana: No point in nagging him about it any further. Hideaki: I'll be on my way, then. What about you, Wakana-chan? Wanna go somewhere if you're free? Wakana: Together with you? Hideaki: Yeah. Wakana: Just the two of us? Hideaki: Yeah! Wakana: Yeah, no way♪ Hideaki: Your blunt replies are too cruel! Wakana: I'm sorry, but I'm busy today. Hideaki: What plans? Wakana: That part-time job. Hideaki: The one Ayachi-san introduced you to? Wakana: Yep. So I don't have time today. Sorry. Hideaki: Work, huh... Well, I guess that's―Huh? Hold on a second. Hideaki: Then why did you ask if it would be the two of us?! Wouldn't that be completely irrelevant?! Wakana: That's just your imagination! Shuuji: If you have school in the day and work in the evening, then doesn't that mean you have no time for homework or studying? Wakana: Yeah, pretty much. I always end up crashing as soon as I come home from work... Wakana: Ugh, our next exams are gonna be rough... Once I get my new guitar, I'm gonna play that bad boy nonstop... Uhehe. Wakana: Oh! I'll be late if I keep standing around chatting like this. See you guys later! Gotta go! Shuuji: See you tomorrow. Hideaki: Don't trip on your shoelaces as you run! Shuuji: Well then, I'll head over to the library now. Hideaki: Yeah, see you. Shuuji: I've been told to come here and register some new books into the library catalog. Committee Girl: Huh? Umm... And you are? I don't remember you being in the Library Committee. Shuuji: I'm filling in for Akita from class 2-A. Apparently, she has something she can't call off and asked me to fill in for her. Committee Girl: Oh, really? If that's how it is... I guess that's alright. Okay, I'm counting on you, then. Shuuji: Sorry, but could you teach me how to do it? Committee Girl: Sure. It's not too hard. Could you sit down at the computer there? Shuuji: Yeah, sure. Committee Girl: So first, you open the database, and then... Okay, there we go. Committee Girl: See the different fields here? Category, title, author, publisher and so on. You have to fill all of them out. Shuuji: I only have to enter the data there and that's it? Committee Girl: Yeah, that's right. Click the register button once they're filled out, and then you'll be back at the main database interface again. Well? Think you can manage? Shuuji: Yeah, probably. Is it okay to ask you if I have any questions later? Committee Girl: Sure thing. Alright, the books you need to register are piled up over here. This is all of them. Shuuji: Got it. Shuuji: Mhm, nnngh... Committee Girl: Umm... You done yet? Shuuji: No, sorry. Shouldn't take much longer, though. Committee Girl: ...Oh. Shuuji: ...... Committee Girl: Huh? Shuuji: I doubt anyone is gonna come by this late anyway, and I can return the key to the faculty room myself once I'm done. Committee Girl: But you aren't on the committee... Shuuji: I've come here to work in place of a Library Committee member. I'm sure me being the one to lock the room up wouldn't be a problem. Committee Girl: You think? Committee Girl: O-Okay then... Could you please handle that for me? Here's the key. Shuuji: Yeah, sure. Committee Girl: Thanks a bunch! I'm off, then! Shuuji: Yeah, bye! Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: ...Hm? Voice: You're kidding me. I came to check up on them since they never came to return the key, and they're nowhere to be seen... I'll need to have a word with them. Girl: Umm, Sensei. Nene: Yes. Time slipped away from me. Sensei: Ah. Well, you shouldn't dawdle around here too much. Nene: Is... there one else here in the library? Sensei: It would seem so. I'm about to lock the room. Nene: I would like you to let me look something up before that. Could you lend me the key? Sensei: You want to look something up this late? Nene: Yes, just something about tarot cards. It won't take much time at all. I'll just need five... no, maybe twenty minutes. Please.  Sensei: ...Well, I suppose I can trust you. Okay, here's the key. Sensei: However, you are to return it to the faculty room within thirty minutes. And make absolutely sure that the room is locked when you leave. Nene: Understood. Thank you very much. Sensei: Alright, goodbye. Nene: Y-Yes... Goodbye... *pant* *pant*... Shuuji: (......?) Shuuji: (...What?) Nene: Ah... ah! Mh... Mhh, mh, mh, mhhh... Shuuji: ...... Nene: Mhh *huff*... *pant* *pant* Ah, aaaah... Fuaaaah... Shuuji: (*gulp*) Nene: No time. I need to hurry, or else... she'll come back... If she sees me doing this... Mhh, mh, mhh, mh! Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah...! Nene: Ah, ah, mhh, mhhh! *pant* *pant* *pant* Ahhh, I'm just the worst! Nene: *paant* *paaant* It feels so good... Ah, ah, aah. So very... good... Mhh! Shuuji: ...... Nene: *pant* *pant* *pant* *paaant*... Ah, ah, ah... ah... Aaaah, mh, mh, mhhh! Nene: Aaaaaah... I can't stop anymore... *slurp*... *pant* *pant*... Aaahhhh! Nene: I want to cum already, I wanna cum... I just want to cum now... *pant* *pant* *pant* Ahh, ah, ah, ah, ah, aaah! Nene: Ah... ah, ah, ah! Ah, ah, ah, aaaaaah! I'm cumming, I'm cumming, I'm cumming, I'm cumming, I'm cumming! Nene: Mhh, mhhhhhhhhhhhh!! Nene: I don't want to move now, but she'll come to check otherwise... I need, to hurry... *pant*... *pant*... But I can't, get any strength, into my body... "

Shuuji: Hm? Where did that come from? Nene: That was so terrible inconsiderate of me... I forgot you quite literally feel it when people are looking at you. Nene: Gosh, that was such an awful mistake on my part... Shuuji: Oh, don't worry about it. It's fine. I wanted to help Kawakami-kun myself. Shuuji: I mean, in the first place, I only feel pain if it's looks of malice or jealousy. There was nothing like that with them.  Nene: But still... It exhausted you considerably, no? Shuuji: Well, I guess. I enjoy doing things with you, and it's not like I was forcing myself to act cool to impress them... But I won't lie―I am pretty pooped.   Nene: I am, too. Honestly, I'm just not cut out for these sorts of things.  Shuuji: You were pretty assertive at Souma-san's cafe, though.  Nene: Ah... Well, come on... I only did that because I thought we had to. You know, since we were acting as Kawakami-kun's reference... Nene: But, to tell you the truth... I enjoyed it quite a bit.  Shuuji: Me too, but I like being able to do those things in private better. It's more relaxing.  Nene: I agree. Today really drained me.  Shuuji: Wait. Do you not want to do anything else today?  Nene: Huh? But... Shuuji: I know we're done helping Kawakami-kun... But I figured maybe we could hang out and do some stuff, just the two of us now.  Nene: Ah, i-if that's what you meant, sure. I would love to. Nene: Today's date, take two... Ah, my apologies. That's a bad way to phrase it. Our date earlier in the day was plenty fun, so why don't we call this... a part two? Shuuji: I dig it. So, could I borrow a bit more of your time today, Nene? Nene: Yes. Absolutely.  Shuuji: Ah, sorry, want me to scoot over a bit? Probably hard to watch the movie when I'm squished up against you.  Nene: N-No, I'm alright... I actually prefer this.  Shuuji: Didn't you say you felt antsy? I thought you were having a hard time watching the movie because I was making you uncomfortable... Nene: Oh no, that wasn't what I meant. In all honesty... My heart's been racing so much I haven't been paying attention to the movie since the beginning... Shuuji: Same here, to be honest. I got too preoccupied with how soft you felt to stay focused on it.  Shuuji: ...... Nene: ...... Nene: It's known to be a fairly emotional story, so I doubt the rest of it has this kind of aggressive, sexual tone... But just looking at the individual scene, it does almost look pornographic.  Nene: Y-Yes... That's true. Shuuji: Hm? What's up? Nene: No, nevermind... Forget about it. Shuuji: Are you sure? You can tell me anything.  Nene: ...I-I can't possibly! It's too embarrassing...

None of those are things that would break.  Shuuji: But still... Nene: They're not! I promise! I promise! Shuuji: If my memory serves me right, I've definitely seen something like this before...

Shuuji: Look... those connect to vibrators... don't they? You've been using them to masturbate again? Nene: ...... Nene: It's not my fault! Girls like to feel good, too! Nene: Plus I had to go so long without you, my sex drive only got stronger... And I became a pervert.  Nene: Ah! But don't get the wrong idea! I don't use them everyday! Only around once or twice per week at most! Shuuji: I never asked you about that! Nene: Ah―――! "

Kanae: What about Ayachi? Shuuji: I couldn't borrow hers since the last class was P.E. Shuuji: I need the homework for our next class, so could I borrow the key? Kanae: Sure, but make sure you bring it back to me here during the break; don't return to your classroom with the key. Can you do that? Shuuji: Of course. I'll do that. Kanae: Fine then. Here you go. Shuuji: Thank you. Shuuji: Okay. I better hurry. Tsumugi: ...... Shuuji: %130;KYAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH?! Tsumugi: Why are you the one screaming?! Shuuji: Oh, uh, you know, it's like, but the thing is... Meguru: You're the worst. Shuuji: ...I'm seriously sorry. Tsumugi: Well, it was break time, and the door was locked... You normally wouldn't think I could be changing inside. Shuuji: Err, well... Yeah. I didn't expect it at all. Nene: I'm very sorry. I should have informed Hoshina-kun beforehand. Tsumugi: You don't need to apologize. There was no time for that since it was just after P.E., right? So... No one is to blame there. Tsumugi: Really, don't worry about it. Actually, umm... Rather than you apologizing, I would like you to forget. Tsumugi: L-Let's just say you never saw anything. Shuuji: Got it. I haven't seen anything. Shuuji: I didn't see you in your underwear at all. Tsumugi: Fueeeeeeaaaahhh! Shuuji: Ahh! Sorry! I didn't mean to say that! I'll forget about it! I'll forget everything! Meguru: I can't tell if you're a pervert or just an idiot! Why would you go in for an extra blow in this situation, super-perv Senpai?! Shuuji: Yeah, I have no excuse. Shuuji: I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Meguru: But why were you changing in the clubroom, anyway, Shiiba-senpai? Nene: I suggested doing so because it looked like she was embarrassed by changing in the locker room. Nene: I already had the key on me, so the clubroom was the first room I thought of for changing in... Shuuji: Why was it embarrassing? You're all girls. Tsumugi: Well, umm... You see, I really surprised everyone when I entered the locker room to change before P.E. Tsumugi: And then actually changing was really embarrassing too. Shuuji: Because everyone was already looking at you? Tsumugi: Partly, yeah... But also, everyone else was able to skillfully change without fully taking off their uniforms. Shuuji: Without taking off their uniforms...? Like how elementary schoolchildren change into swimsuits? Tsumugi: Yeah, right... Shuuji: Girls do that even though it's only other girls in the locker room? Tsumugi: Yeah, they do. Shuuji: Is that common? Nene: Yes. Even when it's with other girls, it's still uncomfortable to be seen half-naked. Meguru: Right. And there's stuff like not wanting to be laughed at for the underwear you're wearing. Shuuji: Is that so? Nene: There's a lot to consider with underwear, such as the comfort level. You tend to wear your most comfortable underwear more often... Nene: But they wear out quickly when you do that, so... Ah! Don't make me say weird stuff like that! Shuuji: No! You did this yourself! Don't blame me for blurting that out on your own! Shuuji: I don't want to know about that kind of stuff, anyway! Tsumugi: But anyway, I can't get around taking off my pants, right? Which is why, umm... I can't avoid letting everyone see my underwear. Shuuji: Well... If you don't take measures beforehand, that's how it turns out, yeah. Tsumugi: Besides, everyone kept looking at me.  Tsumugi: \"She's wearing a boy's uniform, but what about her underwear? Is she wearing a chest binder?\" You could tell that's what everyone was thinking. Shuuji: Yeah, I can see that. Meguru: To be perfectly honest, I've been a little curious about that myself. Tsumugi: I-I'm wearing perfectly normal girls' underwear! I can't show you, though... Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Oh, uh, absolutely nothing! Meguru: But despite that, you ended up experiencing something even more embarrassing... Nene: But you can't keep changing in the clubroom, so we need to come up with another solution. Tsumugi: Right... *sigh* Meguru: Heh heh heh. This is my time to shine. Nene: What do you mean? Meguru: Remember how we talked about changing her hairstyle yesterday? Shuuji: Oh yeah... You mean how changing her hairstyle could change everyone's impression of her? Meguru: Exactly. So, I've already gotten everything ready! Tsumugi: R-Really?! Meguru: Yep! So please, sit down here! I'll do your hair for you. Tsumugi: U-Umm... Okay, thank you so much. Meguru: ～～～♪ Meguru: You have nothing to be embarrassed about! I'm so jealous of your glossy hair. I wish I had hair like that. Tsumugi: You shouldn't worry about that. I mean, your fluffy hair is totally cute. Meguru: I'd rather have it be glossy and silky. But really, your hair is just fantastic～ Nene: Is it that amazing? Meguru: Go ahead and touch it yourself, Nene-senpai. Nene: Okay then, if Shiiba-san doesn't mind... Nene: Wow, it really is smooth. How nice... I'm getting a little jealous myself. Meguru: Oh, please. You have no right to be jealous. Just look at how silky your hair is! Nene: Ah, d-don't! It tickles when you touch me there. Meguru: How interesting... Your nape is ticklish, is it? Tsumugi: Fueh? Ah, hey, sto―! Ahhnn! Shuuji: ...... Tsumugi: Geez, knock it off～ Nene: Inaba-san, no means no, okay? Meguru: 'Kay! Shiiba-senpai, sorry about that. I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable. Shuuji: Is it really that smooth? Mind if I― Nene, Meguru, Tsumugi: ...... Shuuji: Ah, right. Of course I can't. I just thought it wouldn't hurt to ask. Don't mind me. Tsumugi: Y-Yeah, okay. Nene: Shiiba-san, are there any specific hairstyles that you would like? Tsumugi: Let me think... Not really. Anything cute will do! Meguru: Anything cute? Roger that! Meguru: Then, I guess I'll go with this accessory... Or maybe this one? Which would look better? Nene: If she wants to look cute, then I would say this one here, no? Meguru: Ah! That one is great! Way to go, Nene-senpai! You have great taste. Tsumugi: U-Umm, I'm not really used to this kind of thing, so I'm kind of uneasy about it. Just take it slow, okay? Take it slow. Meguru: I'm not sure what there is to be uneasy about... But if that's what you want, then let's just go for a cute hairstyle with no accessories. Meguru: ～～～♪ Nene: A braided hairstyle? Like, in pigtails?  Meguru: Right. Some manga have pretty boys who wear braids, so I think it's worth a try. Tsumugi: I've never braided my hair before. Meguru: Don't worry about it. Your hair is long enough, and it's pretty easy to do. Meguru: Just divide the hair into three strands, cross one outer strand over the middle one, then the other, and... Meguru: Voila! What do you think, Shiiba-senpai? Tsumugi: Umm... Ah, good. It looks like I'm fine! "

No. Forget it. Tsumugi: Hey there. Nene: Good morning, Inaba-san. Good morning, Shiiba-san. Shuuji: Morning. Meguru, Tsumugi: ...... Nene: I-Is everything okay? You're staring at me rather intently.

Shuuji: Your advice really helped me a lot. So thank you for that.  Touko: It wasn't much of anything special, but if it helped, then I'm glad.

Guy: Library Committee? Oh... You mean Akita? Guy: She's probably just playing you. There's a reason people call her the \"mixer queen.\" That thing she can't put off is 100\\% just another mixer. She was even talking about the details in the classroom. Shuuji: Oh, a mixer... I see. I suppose that does involve her future, in a way. Guy: Don't tell me you already knew? Shuuji: Kind of. I didn't know what exactly she was doing, but I did have the feeling it wasn't as important as she made it sound. Shuuji: Well, I could have, but... I just figured that I may as well do it if she already has other plans. Guy: Shuuji... Seriously... Hideaki: Want me to tell them no for you? Shuuji: Don't bother. I appreciate the offer, but I'm not a little child; I'm perfectly capable of saying no when I really don't want to do something. Hideaki: ...And yet I've never seen you do so. Shuuji: Well, I don't have much to do after school, anyway. And it's not like people ask me for help every day. Hideaki: But that doesn't mean you should work for these people while they're out having fun. Hideaki: Whatever. How many times have we had this exchange now? I'm sick of telling you this all the time. Shuuji: Sorry. Shuuji: Not really... I don't have any good reason for it. Shuuji: I just figure that being nice to girls could come in handy someday. Hideaki: At this rate, those leeches will suck you dry, dude. Shuuji: I'm obviously not gonna be as lax with my money. Shuuji: It's just... I can't stand that awkwardness you get when turning people down. Anyway, it's different when I have something to do myself, but I don't mind helping when I'm free. Hideaki: ...I swear, you're gonna get scammed real hard at some point, and it'll suck. Girl: Yeah, I can see it now. It's scary just thinking about it. Hideaki: I know, right? You're with me, aren't you, Wakana-chan? Girl: Yeah. It's not normal to accept every single request, if you ask me. You're not hiding something from us, are ya? Shuuji: Err... Wakana: If I had to guess, maybe he's a hardcore masochist? Shuuji: That's a rather extreme assumption. Hideaki: A hardcore masochist?! I see. So you've been taking on all this work in order to get turned on at school... I never would've expected it... Hideaki: You should've told me we were comrades! Shuuji: Keep your fetishes to yourself, dude! You're freaking me out! Wakana: Huh? You mean having girls work you like a dog DOESN'T turn you on? Shuuji: It really stings to see you so genuinely confused by that. Shuuji: And really, girls shouldn't talk about fetishes in the broad daylight. Wakana: What kind of sexist BS is this? Girls are allowed to talk about sex too. Shuuji: Sure, but usually you keep that sort of talk between girls. Shuuji: You got the hots for me or something? Wakana: Hahaha. Nice joke. I know you don't mean that. Hideaki: Though, it is true that girls talking about that stuff can give us guys the wrong idea. Wakana: Well, we only do so around guys we have no interest in. It's just a normal way to make conversation. Don't read too much into it. Shuuji: Either way, I don't get especially happy or anything when people work me. Hideaki: Yeah, sure. Says the guy who takes every request that comes his way. Shuuji: Well... It's just... Shuuji: Won't girls really like me if I never turn them down? Wakana: Ahahahaha! Not at all. If anything, it makes you look like a dumbass. Shuuji: Man, it stings when you say that so bluntly. Hideaki: You need to turn people down every once in a while. You'll get taken advantage of if you let them think you're so soft. Shuuji: You think I'll get taken advantage of...? Now you're just exaggerating. Wakana: I'm not. There are some nasty girls out there who will totally suck you dry with the way you are now. Shuuji: As if. You're clearly overthinking. Wakana: Tch, tch. You're being naive. Women can be much more calculating than you think. Hideaki: They'll make you pay for their food, for movie tickets, and even for accessories like purses! And all they'll give in return is a \"That was a fun way to kill some time. Thanks! See ya♪\" without any progress between the two of you. Hideaki: And then right after that, they'll suddenly call you and ask you to come pick them up because they missed the last train! For freaking real?! There's mischievous and then there's just plain evil! Wakana, Shuuji: ...... Hideaki: Ah?! S-Sorry guys, all my pent-up frustration just kinda exploded there. Shuuji: Looks like you've been through some serious shit, man. Hideaki: Yeah... I used to mess around a lot. But it's all in the past now. Wakana: That sounds like a real nasty girl you ran into. Shuuji: But getting used like that actually made you happy, didn't it? Hideaki: Well... Yeah, a little. Wakana: Ugh, are you grinning?! What a masochist... Terrifying. Shuuji: I seriously don't get how someone can feel pleasure from being treated so crappily. Hideaki: Hehe... That figures. You two are just greenhorns, after all. Shuuji: I'm not planning on ever becoming a masochist veteran. Shuuji: I wouldn't want that... Alright. I'll be more careful from now on. Hideaki: Have you guys forgotten that I'm right here? Hearing that really hurts, you know? Shuuji: I've got a question. Wakana: Go ahead, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: How do I avoid being taken advantage of while coming off as soft? Wakana: Coming off as soft is already a given? Shuuji: I just feel like I'd get on the girls' bad sides if I suddenly changed my whole attitude, which is scary in its own way. Wakana: Well, I guess that's possible. Hideaki: If you want an example of someone who's kind but doesn't get taken advantage of... Wakana: There's Ayachi-san. Hideaki: Oh, right. She's a perfect example. Girl: Yes? You called me? Hideaki: Whoa! A-Ayachi-san?! Ayachi-san: I'm sorry to have startled you. I just so happened to overhear my name when I was passing by. Ayachi-san: Is there something you need with me? Wakana: Oh, uh, don't worry about us. Your name just came up in our conversation. Hideaki: Yeah, we weren't gossiping about you or anything. Shuuji: Sorry if we offended you. Ayachi-san: Oh no, I'm not upset; I was just curious. Please don't mind me. Ayachi-san: Anyway, Kariya-san, about the thing from before... Wakana: Ah! Yeah, it's going great! That place you introduced me to is awesome! Things are going great thanks to you. Thanks so much! Ayachi-san: I'm happy to hear you like it there. Wakana: I'm really thankful to you. Ayachi-san: Please don't hesitate to visit the clubroom again should something else come up. Wakana: Thanks! I will! Schoolgirl B: Ah, Ayachi-saaan! Thanks for letting me borrow your notebook. You were a life-saver. And I have to say, the notes you took were super neat. You're awesome! Ayachi-san: Oh, it was no big deal. More importantly, are you feeling better now? Schoolgirl B: Yeah, I feel great! Ayachi-san: I'm glad to hear that. Is there anything else that is troubling you? Schoolgirl B: No, nothing at the moment. Ayachi-san: I'm willing to help you out or lend an ear to your worries anytime. It doesn't need to be school related; I'm happy to listen to private or other problems too. Schoolgirl B: Thanks. I'll be sure to stop by if something comes up. Ayachi-san: Yes, please do. Shuuji: Huh? Umm... What do you mean? Nene: I'd be glad to help if something should ever concern you. Shuuji: Oh, thanks. I'm happy for the offer, but there's nothing like that right now. Nene: Is that so? For some reason, I got the feeling that there's something worrying you... Shuuji: Y-Yeah...? Shuuji: Yeah...? Nene: No, I haven't... I just had a gut feeling about it. Wakana: Considering how many people you've helped, I think you're right to trust that feeling. Shuuji: What's that supposed to mean? The part about her helping people. Wakana: Oh, whoops... Right... Sorry, Ayachi-san! You're keeping this from the guys, aren't you? Nene: Oh, no, it's not that big of a secret, so don't worry about it. Nene: It would just be a problem for me if people showed up out of curiosity, so I'm asking that you only keep it to people who actually need help. Hideaki: ...? Did we overhear something we shouldn't have? Nene: It's nothing that big... I'm in the OC. Hideaki: OC? Shuuji: Um, you mean... the Occult Club? Nene: Yes. That's right. Shuuji: I didn't know we had one of those at this school. This is the first I'm hearing of it. Hideaki: Same here. And it's not just a circle, but an actual club? Nene: That's right. It's a club that's been around since before we entered this school. Though, I'm currently the only member. Nene: The Student Council has been on our case because of that... After all, the club doesn't do any sort of exhibitions or the like. Hideaki: So... do you research ghosts or something? Or maybe aliens? Nene: No, I am doing divination. \"Occult\" involves the entire spectrum of the supernatural. I am thankfully able to do as I please since I am the only member. Hideaki: By divination you mean, doing hand signs and being like \"And there we have it!\"? Shuuji: It's impressive how old that reference is. I don't think anyone is gonna get that. Wakana: You instantly recognizing it is just as impressive. I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. You guys are such geeks. Right, Ayachi-san? Nene: I obviously can't do Albino Snake Divination. Wakana: You know about it too?! Nene: Yeah, kind of, but I can only do tarot card reading. Divination is nothing more than a hobby for me, after all. Wakana: Anyway, she's also offering counseling there. Nene: It's really just part of the divination I'm doing. It hardly deserves to be called \"counseling.\" Nene: But if you want, don't hesitate to come over to my clubroom anytime, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Oh, sure. Thanks. Schoolgirl A: Ayachi-saaan! I need your help with our classic Japanese homework! Nene: Oh, of course. I'll be right there. Nene: Okay then. I must excuse myself now. Hideaki: She's almost a little too perfect to be real. Hideaki: But anyway, people consult her for a lot of stuff, huh? I would've expected that to turn into a big rumor. Wakana: It's well-known among girls. It'd be a big problem for Ayachi-san if the guys found out and caused a commotion, though. Hideaki: Ah, is that so... Maybe I should pay her a visit too, and then... Ehee! Shuuji: Allow me to read your thoughts: \"Maybe I could get closer to her.\" Hideaki: Huh?! What?! Espers are real? And you're one of them?! Wakana: What're you talking about? You couldn't have been more obvious. You were practically oozing with sleaze. Shuuji: You're even drooling some. Hideaki: Really?! Oh, you're right! Shuuji: I'm guessing that the girls don't spread that rumor around because of how many guys like you there are. Wakana: That's right. You two better keep this to yourselves. Hideaki: Sure. You bet! Shuuji: So anyway, did you also consult her about something, Kariya? I mean, you just thanked her and all. Wakana: I did. I really want something, but I was worried because I didn't have the money for it. Shuuji: What do you want? Wakana: Well... A guitar. Hideaki: A guitar? Sure didn't expect that. Shuuji: You can play the guitar? Well, I guess you wouldn't want one if you couldn't. Wakana: Yeah, a little. Wakana: It's been a few years now, and so I'd like to finally get my own guitar. Shuuji: Huh. My only musical experience comes from music class, though that was ages ago. Hideaki: I could probably play a bit better than Shuuji, then. I had a phase where I was really into music, and so I tried my hand at the guitar. Wakana: Oh, really? That's unexpected. Hideaki: Well, that was a while ago. So? Since you're saving up money, you gonna get a good one? Wakana: Yeah, I'd like a decent one, at least. Though, the prices of musical instruments are pretty crazy. Shuuji: True. Especially vintage instruments. The amount those go for is just bonkers. Wakana: Dad told me to get one with my own money. Would it have killed him to give me at least some of the money for it? Shuuji: So, how did Ayachi-san help you with that? Wakana: She introduced me to a part-time job. Wakana: And now I'm going to finally reach my goal with my next paycheck, meaning I'll be getting my guitar really soon♪ Uhehe. Hideaki: A part-time job, huh? That's nice. Maybe I could have her introduce me to one as well? Wakana: Allow me to read your thoughts: \"Maybe then, I could get closer to her. I could even ask her out on a date to 'repay her' with my first paycheck!\" Hideaki: Is everyone I know a freaking esper?! Shuuji: Look, anyone could guess as much. The fact that she was right just means you're simple. Hideaki: Wh-Whatever! Who cares! Besides, as a guy, I can't let an opportunity to get to know a cute girl like her slip by! Wakana: Well, you have a point... I guess. Shuuji: I'm guessing all the other single guys out there are looking for opportunities too. Student 2: What was it about? I-I want to know... Damn, I'm so jealous of them. Student 3: Damn it... I wanna chat with her too. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Uh... It's nothing. Hideaki: Don't act like this is none of your business. You'd love to get closer with Ayachi-san too, right? Why not get a tarot reading from her? She invited you for one, after all. Shuuji: I dunno... I'll swing by and ask for one once something comes up. Hideaki: What a waste. Wakana: I feel like she wouldn't like it if he went there without a good reason. Hideaki: Huh?! Really? Wakana: Nobody likes a guy who clearly has ulterior motives, you know? Hideaki: Except when you're hot. Wakana: Well, too bad you aren't. Hideaki: Wow! How could you?! Wakana: I don't think girls like Ayachi-san are that shallow. What matters is if you're attractive on the inside, not the outside. Hideaki: I see. Wakana: Besides, people with great personalities wouldn't approach her like that in the first place. Hideaki: Ugh... I guess it's game, set and match for me. Shuuji: Guys, we better head back to class. Afternoon classes are about to start. Wakana: Oh, yeah. Right. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: (Phew...) Shuuji: It's cool. Don't worry about it. Girl: Thanks. Okay then, bye-bye♪ Shuuji: See you tomorrow. Hideaki: So you're still doing this, huh? Shuuji: For today, yeah. It wouldn't be right to turn her down now after I already told her I'd do it. Wakana: Yeah, fair enough. Hideaki: *sigh*... Okay, fine. Want me to give you a hand? Shuuji: Err... Shuuji: I appreciate the sentiment, but no thanks. Hideaki: Knew you'd say that. Wakana: Yeah, it was practically a given. Shuuji: What do you mean? Hideaki: You're a real lone wolf, dude. Shuuji: Okay, look. All I'm doing today is entering some data into their computer database, so I really don't need your help. Shuuji: I'll ask you for help for sure next time something like this happens. Wakana: Stubborn to the end, I see. Hideaki: There's not supposed to be a \"next time.\" You're supposed to turn them down instead. Shuuji: Yeah, yeah. I know. Hideaki: Looks like he's gonna keep on helping people after this. Wakana: That's just how he is. It's not something that can be fixed that easily. Wakana: No point in nagging him about it any further. Hideaki: I'll be on my way, then. What about you, Wakana-chan? Wanna go somewhere if you're free? Wakana: Together with you? Hideaki: Yeah. Wakana: Just the two of us? Hideaki: Yeah! Wakana: Yeah, no way♪ Hideaki: Your blunt replies are too cruel! Wakana: I'm sorry, but I'm busy today. Hideaki: What plans? Wakana: That part-time job. Hideaki: The one Ayachi-san introduced you to? Wakana: Yep. So I don't have time today. Sorry. Hideaki: Work, huh... Well, I guess that's―Huh? Hold on a second. Hideaki: Then why did you ask if it would be the two of us?! Wouldn't that be completely irrelevant?! Wakana: That's just your imagination! Shuuji: If you have school in the day and work in the evening, then doesn't that mean you have no time for homework or studying? Wakana: Yeah, pretty much. I always end up crashing as soon as I come home from work... Wakana: Ugh, our next exams are gonna be rough... Once I get my new guitar, I'm gonna play that bad boy nonstop... Uhehe. Wakana: Oh! I'll be late if I keep standing around chatting like this. See you guys later! Gotta go! Shuuji: See you tomorrow. Hideaki: Don't trip on your shoelaces as you run! Shuuji: Well then, I'll head over to the library now. Hideaki: Yeah, see you. Shuuji: I've been told to come here and register some new books into the library catalog. Committee Girl: Huh? Umm... And you are? I don't remember you being in the Library Committee. Shuuji: I'm filling in for Akita from class 2-A. Apparently, she has something she can't call off and asked me to fill in for her. Committee Girl: Oh, really? If that's how it is... I guess that's alright. Okay, I'm counting on you, then. Shuuji: Sorry, but could you teach me how to do it? Committee Girl: Sure. It's not too hard. Could you sit down at the computer there? Shuuji: Yeah, sure. Committee Girl: So first, you open the database, and then... Okay, there we go. Committee Girl: See the different fields here? Category, title, author, publisher and so on. You have to fill all of them out. Shuuji: I only have to enter the data there and that's it? Committee Girl: Yeah, that's right. Click the register button once they're filled out, and then you'll be back at the main database interface again. Well? Think you can manage? Shuuji: Yeah, probably. Is it okay to ask you if I have any questions later? Committee Girl: Sure thing. Alright, the books you need to register are piled up over here. This is all of them. Shuuji: Got it. Shuuji: Mhm, nnngh... Committee Girl: Umm... You done yet? Shuuji: No, sorry. Shouldn't take much longer, though. Committee Girl: ...Oh. Shuuji: ...... Committee Girl: Huh? Shuuji: I doubt anyone is gonna come by this late anyway, and I can return the key to the faculty room myself once I'm done. Committee Girl: But you aren't on the committee... Shuuji: I've come here to work in place of a Library Committee member. I'm sure me being the one to lock the room up wouldn't be a problem. Committee Girl: You think? Committee Girl: O-Okay then... Could you please handle that for me? Here's the key. Shuuji: Yeah, sure. Committee Girl: Thanks a bunch! I'm off, then! Shuuji: Yeah, bye! Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: ...Hm? Voice: You're kidding me. I came to check up on them since they never came to return the key, and they're nowhere to be seen... I'll need to have a word with them. Girl: Umm, Sensei. Nene: Yes. Time slipped away from me. Sensei: Ah. Well, you shouldn't dawdle around here too much. Nene: Is... there one else here in the library? Sensei: It would seem so. I'm about to lock the room. Nene: I would like you to let me look something up before that. Could you lend me the key? Sensei: You want to look something up this late? Nene: Yes, just something about tarot cards. It won't take much time at all. I'll just need five... no, maybe twenty minutes. Please.  Sensei: ...Well, I suppose I can trust you. Okay, here's the key. Sensei: However, you are to return it to the faculty room within thirty minutes. And make absolutely sure that the room is locked when you leave. Nene: Understood. Thank you very much. Sensei: Alright, goodbye. Nene: Y-Yes... Goodbye... *pant* *pant*... Shuuji: (......?) Shuuji: (...What?) Nene: Ah... ah! Mh... Mhh, mh, mh, mhhh... Shuuji: ...... Nene: Mhh *huff*... *pant* *pant* Ah, aaaah... Fuaaaah... Shuuji: (*gulp*) Nene: No time. I need to hurry, or else... she'll come back... If she sees me doing this... Mhh, mh, mhh, mh! Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah...! Nene: Ah, ah, mhh, mhhh! *pant* *pant* *pant* Ahhh, I'm just the worst! Nene: *paant* *paaant* It feels so good... Ah, ah, aah. So very... good... Mhh! Shuuji: ...... Nene: *pant* *pant* *pant* *paaant*... Ah, ah, ah... ah... Aaaah, mh, mh, mhhh! Nene: Aaaaaah... I can't stop anymore... *slurp*... *pant* *pant*... Aaahhhh! Nene: I want to cum already, I wanna cum... I just want to cum now... *pant* *pant* *pant* Ahh, ah, ah, ah, ah, aaah! Nene: Ah... ah, ah, ah! Ah, ah, ah, aaaaaah! I'm cumming, I'm cumming, I'm cumming, I'm cumming, I'm cumming! Nene: Mhh, mhhhhhhhhhhhh!! Nene: I don't want to move now, but she'll come to check otherwise... I need, to hurry... *pant*... *pant*... But I can't, get any strength, into my body... "

            "Nene: Good morning. Shuuji: I was just captivated by your smile. Nene: What? Ah... urk... There you go again, teasing and embarrassing me... Shuuji: Hey, it was the truth. Shuuji: Right. So any ideas? Any place you wanna go, or any things you wanna do?  Nene: Let's see... umm. Shuuji: It can be anything you want.  Shuuji: Ya? Nene: Yakiniku! I want to go to a yakiniku buffet. Shuuji: ...You wanna go to a buffet? Nene: Yes. I've always wanted to try going to those once... Is it too weird? I know, a buffet on our first date is a little... Shuuji: Nah, I don't mind going. It was just a little unexpected. Nene: Hmm... Karaoke, bowling, oh and also a photo booth... Shuuji: Quite a lot there.  Nene: I'm sorry. They're all things I've been interested in doing, but I could never work up the courage to go alone... Shuuji: Nothing wrong with that. It actually makes me happy that I get to do all these things with you.  Shuuji: Aight, we're gonna do all of 'em! We'll have some yakiniku, go to a karaoke bar, bowl, and take some pictures at a photo booth. Shuuji: Everything you want to do, Nene. Nene: ...Thanks! Shuuji: You did pretty good for your first time.  Nene: Umm, if it's alright by you... Could I make you one as well? Shuuji: Sure. Actually, I'd love that.  Nene: Okay! I'll be right back! Shuuji: Thanks, Nene. Shuuji: Dang, this is good! I just knew the ice cream cone you made me would be extra good. Nene: Thank you for the compliment. But I think the taste of the ice cream is the same no matter who makes it. Shuuji: That's how it should be, yeah. Which is why it's all the more a mystery that mine tastes so good.  Shuuji: Hm? What's wrong? Nene: You got a little bit of it on your face.  Shuuji: Where? Shuuji: Okay, thanks. Nene: You're welcome... Alright then, umm, umm... Nene: ...*lick* Shuuji: Nnh―――?! Nene: O-Okay. That was... all of it. Shuuji: Nene, did you just... Shuuji: Yeah, it's all good. Shocked me a bit, but I don't mind. I kind of enjoyed it, actually. Shuuji: So, um... yeah... Nene: ...... Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Hmm... You don't wanna do it again? Nene: Gosh... You'd better not move.  Nene: Mhhhh... *lick* Okay, that's all of it. Shuuji: ...... Nene: Th-That was the last time I'm doing it, though, okay? There are people around us... And it's way too embarrassing.  Nene: I wouldn't mind... But there's a place I'd like to go to. Would you care to come with me? Shuuji: Sure, but where are we going? Nene: Don't worry, it's somewhere close by. We can get there by foot. Shuuji: Okay. Shuuji: Wait... Shuuji: Our school? What are we doing here? Nene: Come on, we're not there yet! Shuuji: Ah, wait up. Nene? Nene: Of course. Some of our sports teams are having competitions fairly soon, so the school is remaining open on weekends for the rest of the year.  Shuuji: Oh, wow. I didn't know that.  Nene: But we might want to make sure nobody sees us. We could get in trouble since we don't have on our uniforms.  Shuuji: Got it. Shuuji: Hmm... I'd say either the locker or on the whiteboard.  Nene: Ah, I was thinking of the locker too. Since we both agree on it, I say we do that. And, perfect.  Nene: Looking at this really makes us seem like a true couple.  Shuuji: Huh? I mean, we've done plenty of things couples do thus far in our relationship... Nene: Yes, I do admit we've been pretty intimate... I know you mentioned it one time, how sometimes we seem more like a husband and wife.  Shuuji: Ah, right. I remember that.  Nene: It goes without saying that I've wholeheartedly enjoyed everything we've done in our relationship thus far... But new things can also be fun. Shuuji: Yeah, I completely agree. Nene: Perfect... I've had so much fun on our date that my mind is out of ideas. I'm completely satisfied.  Shuuji: Me too. I had so much fun with you today it was crazy.  Shuuji: But, the day's not quite over yet.  Nene: ...... Shuuji: You ready? Let's go eat dinner somewhere. Nene: I'd love to, but there's one problem... It seems my time is up. Nene: I would've wanted to eat dinner with you, too... If possible... But I don't think we have enough time left for that.  Shuuji: ...Oh. Nene: I want you to know, I truly had fun on our date. Getting to spend my day with you filled me with so much happiness. Nene: There are countless more things that I would love to do with you... But I won't say that I have regrets. I'm happy.  Nene: ...... Shuuji: Nene? Nene: ...... Nene: After I've gone... There's a chance the hole in your heart may reopen. I have to retrieve them to prevent that from happening. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Alright. Nene: You're not surprised, or anything? Do you really want to go forward with this so readily? Shuuji: I love you more than the world, Nene. And I know that you love me just as much, if not more.  Shuuji: So if this is what you want, then I'll go along with it. It's something I wanted to do, anyways. I don't want to leave you with any regrets. Shuuji: Come on, Nene, don't frown like that. Give me that beautiful smile that I know and love you for. Nene: I've... really changed. Before I met you, all I could think about was my contract... There very well could've been a hole in my own heart, just like yours.  Nene: But I was able to change myself for the better.  Shuuji: So was I. Meeting you made such a difference for me, Nene.  Nene: I love the person I've become since then. Returning to my previous self... It's a very sad thought to me now.  Shuuji: It's the exact same for me. Before summer break, I wasn't even capable of smiling from the bottom of my heart. I know how important and precious it is to smile now, thanks to you.  Nene: I want to protect you, Shuuji-kun. Because of the gratitude I feel towards you. Of course, I know I have no right to say that when I'm about to cause you so much pain.  Nene: It's selfish of me to force my own wishes on you, like I have some authority over you. I know I should feel ashamed of that.  Nene: But still, I want to see you smile. I want you to be happy even after I leave.  Nene: ...I'm so, so sorry for doing this. But I... want you to know... Nene: I truly love you from the bottom of my heart. Shuuji: I truly love you from the bottom of my heart too, Nene. Shuuji: You promised me you'd be smiling when you left.  Nene: ...... Shuuji: If you cried during our final moment together I'm sure you'd end up regretting it.  Shuuji: And just a minute or two ago, you said you didn't want any regrets. You'd ruin it all by doing something like that now.  Nene: This really is it... Shuuji: ...I guess so. Shuuji: That's enough.  Shuuji: I already know how you feel. And likewise, you know how I feel. Shuuji: So if you want to give me anything, give me a smile, Nene. And I'll give you one too, to wish you luck on your journey.  Nene: ...... Nene: Thank you. I'll find happiness, I promise. And furthermore, I'll find you, and we'll be happy together.  Shuuji: I know you can do it.  Nene: It will happen. You have my word on it.  Shuuji: Okay. Nene: It may take a bit of time... But I swear to you that I'll find you and make you happy. We'll both smile again, together, from the bottom of our hearts. Shuuji: Ah――! Nene: ...See you soon. "

            "Kanae: Huh? You're joining a club? Kanae: Well, yeah. You've never been one to care about making friends with your classmates.  Kanae: And now you're suddenly joining a club... Oh, don't get the wrong idea, though; Personally I'm all in favor of you joining a club. Kanae: Socializing with your peers is a staple part of school, and see, you've been on my mind for a while now.  Kanae: But why the OC of all the clubs out there? Shuuji: Well, things happened. Shuuji: Plus Ayachi-san's the only member, so I wouldn't have to worry about cliques or anything like that.  Kanae: Uh-huh. Did you get Ayachi's permission? Shuuji: Yeah, of course. Kanae: ...Well, if she's alright with it, I've got nothing to say.  Kanae: Here's your admission form. Just fill it out and hand it to Ayachi. Shuuji: Thanks. Kanae: Just curious, Hoshina, but have you always known Ayachi-san? I don't remember you two ever being in class together, and I've never seen you with her around school.  Shuuji: Well, some stuff happened... We're friends now, though.  Kanae: Still, talk about out of left field... Not only you joining the club, but Ayachi-san letting you.  Shuuji: So a lot of people still want to join her club over here, then? Kanae: Over here? Over where? Shuuji: Ah, forget that. But, right, back to what I was saying: Do a lot of people try to join? Kanae: Oh, you bet. The only member's the envy of the whole school. There'd be something up if people WEREN'T wanting to join. Kanae: Hmm... Hard to answer... I'm not her homeroom teacher, you gotta remember.  Shuuji: But you're the club advisor, right? Kanae: Yeah, but that's pretty much just on paper... The OC doesn't require much work for me, as the advisor. Kanae: Anyway, this is just based on how I see her around school... But I get this impression that she's overloaded. Kanae: Kind of like a rubber band, so pulled back you're just waiting for it to snap. I'd be lying if I said I'm not concerned about how strung-up she appears. Kanae: Since you're joining, I'm guessing you know what the club does? Shuuji: Yeah. Listening to student's problems, reading tarot fortunes for them, and then helping with the problem in whatever way we can.  Kanae: Right. But she's doing that all by herself. I'm sure you know how people sometimes get with their hobbies... Take it lightly, end up slacking on occasion, and so on. Kanae: That girl, though, she never skimps. Never compromises. And despite how much effort she pours into her club, her grades remain at the top of the pack.  Shuuji: ...... Kanae: Then there's also the fact that she treats everyone the same. You'll never hear any arguments or bickering from her class.  Shuuji: What's bad about that?  Kanae: It's not bad, per se, but it's just not normal.  Kanae: Remember, we're talking 30 young men and women, all cooped up in a small room for an extended period of time. Not everyone's gonna get along perfectly. But with Ayachi, she mediates and stops every potential dispute. Kanae: Of course you have students that'll naturally end up in that role, but what's worrying me with Ayachi is that she comes off way too serious about it.  Shuuji: ...Huh.  Kanae: Pretty much the opposite with you, though. I'm worried about how uninterested you are in your classmates.   Kanae: Boy, all my problems would be solved if I could just find a way to mix you two together.  Shuuji: Sorry for the trouble. Kanae: Well, it's what I signed up for when I became a teacher. But if you have the time to be apologizing to me, go out there and socialize some.  Shuuji: ...I'll do what I can. Kanae: Honestly, I'm more worried about you than Ayachi.  Shuuji: Huh? Am I that bad at socializing? Kanae: Absolutely. I'm only a tad bit worried for Ayachi. But with you, mister, it's full-on concern. I can already envision the sad life you'll have after graduation if you don't change.  Kanae: So like I said, joining a club is a step in the right direction, no matter the reason. Kanae: Still... Just how the heck did you get Ayachi to let you join? Shuuji: I don't know, I must just be that sexy and irresistible.  Kanae: BHYAHYAHYAHYA!! Hoshina, you'd make a good comedian! Nearly spit out me coffee after hearing that one ROFL. Kanae: Holy cow, that was golden. Talk about a hilarious joke. Never seen sarcasm that on-point. I mean, who would be willing to roast themselves that hard for a joke?  Kanae: Haah, haah... Phew, you're a hoot. I'll be rootin' for ya, so keep it up, mister Sexy Man Hoshina. LOL. Shuuji: Glad to see you still cackle just like a witch. You know, if you keep talking like some internet memester from the 2000s, you're never going to find a― Kanae: Huh? You say something, punk? Shuuji: Nooope. Nothing at all. Kanae: Have a good rest of the day.  Shuuji: ...... Kanae: \"Of course you have students that'll naturally end up in that role, but what's worrying me with Ayachi is that she comes off way too serious about it.\" "

Shuuji: I had this vague impression in my mind that rosy, romantic talk was the way to go.  Meguru: I really feel like that differs for everyone. In Hisashima-sensei's case, well... She'd probably just think you're stupid. Tsumugi: Yeah. I probably don't know her as well as you guys, but I can just picture her yelling \"Get to the damn point already.\" Shuuji: Ahh... Yeah. That's definitely in-line with her personality.  Shuuji: I see. Nene: Yes, if you would. Meguru: So, just a question, but is there any sort of breakthrough idea he's gonna get from these? Touko: Hmm, I guess that depends on what positive qualities he has... Touko: Hoshina-kun, you, Ayachi-san and Shiiba-san are in his class, right?  Tsumugi: I am, but I don't know him very well yet... Tsumugi: But from what I've seen, he seems funny and pretty cool.  Nene: He also seems quite proactive. Oh, and he's always smiling.  Shuuji: Yeah, he has a lot of guts at times, surprisingly. Kinda like with this, when he makes up his mind to do something, he gives it 110\\%.  Touko: If you just look at it on paper, it could work out, but... Meguru: The problem being she answered question number 11 with \"Shouldn't happen.\" That seems like a preeetty big hurdle to overcome... Shuuji: Well, it's up to Kaidou to make up his mind after seeing it. I'll go tell him the results in a bit. Tsumugi: So are we basically done for today, then?  Touko: Ah, one thing before that. I need to collect everyone's surveys. Have you guys all filled them out?  Meguru: Uh-huh. Here's mine.  Tsumugi: I did mine too. Just promise me you won't look. I'm a little embarrassed.  Touko: I won't, I won't. There'd be no point in making it anonymous if I did. Just give it to me face down and I'll shuffle it in with the rest. Shuuji: Ahh, crap... Sorry. I forgot to do mine... Touko: Come on now, Hoshina-kun. You gotta keep your promises. Nene: I'm sorry... I actually forgot to do mine too. Touko: Even you did? Meguru: Wow. You never make silly mistakes like forgetting to do something.  Touko: Do you have the surveys on you? Shuuji: Sorry. I think I left mine on my table at home... Touko: Well, nothing we can do about that. Just make sure you get them to me tomorrow after school and I'll take them to the Newspaper Club with the rest. Shuuji: Okay. Nene: Thank you.  Shuuji: Also, she basically lives the life of a single, middle-aged man. Here's a basic summary of her answers.  Shuuji: So do you know what you're gonna do? Hideaki: Nope. But now that I got this information, I'm gonna give it some serious thought. Hideaki: Looking at this stuff, though... Shit, how do I confess? What approach is gonna do me the best... Hideaki: I just hope I find something I can use as a starting point.  Shuuji: Look, you don't have to force yourself to go through with it now because of our help.

But what exactly does it feel like to love someone so much you feel like you're going crazy?  Hideaki: Well... Didn't I already tell you? You think about that person 24/7 and can't help it.  Hideaki: You want to talk with her, you follow her with your eyes whenever you're around her. You try and think of ways to spend time with her and get jealous over the dumbest things... Hideaki: Frankly speaking, it's all shit that seems pretty creepy when you stop and think about it.  Hideaki: But no matter how weird you think it is, you can't do a damn thing to stop it. When you see her having fun or smiling, it's the sweetest feeling in the world. Shuuji: You find yourself staring at her when she smiles?  Hideaki: Oh, you betcha. Happens all the time.  Shuuji: What about dreams? Do you dream about her too? Hideaki: Occasionally. That happens when you're thinking about her 'round the clock. Awake or asleep doesn't matter.  Shuuji: Hmm... I see... Shuuji: No, no, it's nothing! Hideaki: You're a goddamn open book, I swear.  Shuuji: ...... Hideaki: No need to hide it, man. Nothing embarrassing about being in love with Ayachi-san.

Do you dare try to deny it?  Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: ...Was it that obvious? Hideaki: Definitely. I'd say anyone who knows you a bit better would notice immediately. Shuuji: Well... I guess she doesn't mind me. Shuuji: Well, a lot's happened.  Hideaki: So are you gonna tell her? I can tell you, you're sure as hell not gonna get anywhere if you just keep wracking your brains over it.  Shuuji: ...Hmm. Shuuji: What do you think I should do? Hideaki: That's for you to decide, man. It's your life, not mine.  Shuuji: That's what you say after egging me on to confess? Hideaki: Hahahaha. What I'm basically saying is, give it some serious thought.  Shuuji: Yeah. Hideaki: Oh right. Would you mind letting me return the key? Shuuji: Sure, fine by me... Do you want to talk to Sensei? Hideaki: You're not supposed to say it, man.  Hideaki: We're here to return the key. Kanae: Hm? Ah, right. Thanks. Kanae: But seriously, just what were you two guys doing in there two days in a row? Shuuji: Completely normal things.  Hideaki: Don't go spreading any funny rumors about us now, Kanae-chan. Kanae: Don't call me Kanae-chan. And especially not in the faculty room.

You'll get taken advantage of if you let them think you're so soft. Shuuji: You think I'll get taken advantage of...? Now you're just exaggerating. Wakana: I'm not.

Women can be much more calculating than you think. Hideaki: They'll make you pay for their food, for movie tickets, and even for accessories like purses! And all they'll give in return is a \"That was a fun way to kill some time. Thanks! See ya♪\" without any progress between the two of you. Hideaki: And then right after that, they'll suddenly call you and ask you to come pick them up because they missed the last train! For freaking real?! There's mischievous and then there's just plain evil! Wakana, Shuuji: ...... Hideaki: Ah?! S-Sorry guys, all my pent-up frustration just kinda exploded there. Shuuji: Looks like you've been through some serious shit, man. Hideaki: Yeah... I used to mess around a lot. But it's all in the past now. Wakana: That sounds like a real nasty girl you ran into. Shuuji: But getting used like that actually made you happy, didn't it? Hideaki: Well... Yeah, a little. Wakana: Ugh, are you grinning?! What a masochist... Terrifying. Shuuji: I seriously don't get how someone can feel pleasure from being treated so crappily. Hideaki: Hehe... That figures. You two are just greenhorns, after all. Shuuji: I'm not planning on ever becoming a masochist veteran. Shuuji: I wouldn't want that... Alright. I'll be more careful from now on. Hideaki: Have you guys forgotten that I'm right here? Hearing that really hurts, you know? Shuuji: I've got a question. Wakana: Go ahead, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: How do I avoid being taken advantage of while coming off as soft? Wakana: Coming off as soft is already a given? Shuuji: I just feel like I'd get on the girls' bad sides if I suddenly changed my whole attitude, which is scary in its own way. Wakana: Well, I guess that's possible. Hideaki: If you want an example of someone who's kind but doesn't get taken advantage of... Wakana: There's Ayachi-san. Hideaki: Oh, right. She's a perfect example. Girl: Yes? You called me? Hideaki: Whoa! A-Ayachi-san?! Ayachi-san: I'm sorry to have startled you. I just so happened to overhear my name when I was passing by. Ayachi-san: Is there something you need with me? Wakana: Oh, uh, don't worry about us. Your name just came up in our conversation. Hideaki: Yeah, we weren't gossiping about you or anything. Shuuji: Sorry if we offended you. Ayachi-san: Oh no, I'm not upset; I was just curious. Please don't mind me. Ayachi-san: Anyway, Kariya-san, about the thing from before... Wakana: Ah! Yeah, it's going great! That place you introduced me to is awesome! Things are going great thanks to you. Thanks so much! Ayachi-san: I'm happy to hear you like it there. Wakana: I'm really thankful to you. Ayachi-san: Please don't hesitate to visit the clubroom again should something else come up. Wakana: Thanks! I will! Schoolgirl B: Ah, Ayachi-saaan! Thanks for letting me borrow your notebook. You were a life-saver. And I have to say, the notes you took were super neat. You're awesome! Ayachi-san: Oh, it was no big deal. More importantly, are you feeling better now? Schoolgirl B: Yeah, I feel great! Ayachi-san: I'm glad to hear that. Is there anything else that is troubling you? Schoolgirl B: No, nothing at the moment. Ayachi-san: I'm willing to help you out or lend an ear to your worries anytime. It doesn't need to be school related; I'm happy to listen to private or other problems too. Schoolgirl B: Thanks. I'll be sure to stop by if something comes up. Ayachi-san: Yes, please do. Shuuji: Huh? Umm... What do you mean? Nene: I'd be glad to help if something should ever concern you. Shuuji: Oh, thanks. I'm happy for the offer, but there's nothing like that right now. Nene: Is that so? For some reason, I got the feeling that there's something worrying you... Shuuji: Y-Yeah...? Shuuji: Yeah...? Nene: No, I haven't... I just had a gut feeling about it. Wakana: Considering how many people you've helped, I think you're right to trust that feeling. Shuuji: What's that supposed to mean? The part about her helping people. Wakana: Oh, whoops... Right... Sorry, Ayachi-san! You're keeping this from the guys, aren't you? Nene: Oh, no, it's not that big of a secret, so don't worry about it. Nene: It would just be a problem for me if people showed up out of curiosity, so I'm asking that you only keep it to people who actually need help. Hideaki: ...? Did we overhear something we shouldn't have? Nene: It's nothing that big... I'm in the OC. Hideaki: OC? Shuuji: Um, you mean... the Occult Club? Nene: Yes. That's right. Shuuji: I didn't know we had one of those at this school. This is the first I'm hearing of it. Hideaki: Same here. And it's not just a circle, but an actual club? Nene: That's right. It's a club that's been around since before we entered this school. Though, I'm currently the only member. Nene: The Student Council has been on our case because of that... After all, the club doesn't do any sort of exhibitions or the like. Hideaki: So... do you research ghosts or something? Or maybe aliens? Nene: No, I am doing divination. \"Occult\" involves the entire spectrum of the supernatural. I am thankfully able to do as I please since I am the only member. Hideaki: By divination you mean, doing hand signs and being like \"And there we have it!\"? Shuuji: It's impressive how old that reference is. I don't think anyone is gonna get that. Wakana: You instantly recognizing it is just as impressive. I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. You guys are such geeks. Right, Ayachi-san? Nene: I obviously can't do Albino Snake Divination. Wakana: You know about it too?! Nene: Yeah, kind of, but I can only do tarot card reading. Divination is nothing more than a hobby for me, after all. Wakana: Anyway, she's also offering counseling there. Nene: It's really just part of the divination I'm doing. It hardly deserves to be called \"counseling.\" Nene: But if you want, don't hesitate to come over to my clubroom anytime, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Oh, sure. Thanks. Schoolgirl A: Ayachi-saaan! I need your help with our classic Japanese homework! Nene: Oh, of course. I'll be right there. Nene: Okay then. I must excuse myself now. Hideaki: She's almost a little too perfect to be real. Hideaki: But anyway, people consult her for a lot of stuff, huh? I would've expected that to turn into a big rumor. Wakana: It's well-known among girls. It'd be a big problem for Ayachi-san if the guys found out and caused a commotion, though. Hideaki: Ah, is that so... Maybe I should pay her a visit too, and then... Ehee! Shuuji: Allow me to read your thoughts: \"Maybe I could get closer to her.\" Hideaki: Huh?! What?! Espers are real? And you're one of them?! Wakana: What're you talking about? You couldn't have been more obvious. You were practically oozing with sleaze. Shuuji: You're even drooling some. Hideaki: Really?! Oh, you're right! Shuuji: I'm guessing that the girls don't spread that rumor around because of how many guys like you there are. Wakana: That's right. You two better keep this to yourselves. Hideaki: Sure. You bet! Shuuji: So anyway, did you also consult her about something, Kariya? I mean, you just thanked her and all. Wakana: I did. I really want something, but I was worried because I didn't have the money for it. Shuuji: What do you want? Wakana: Well... A guitar. Hideaki: A guitar? Sure didn't expect that. Shuuji: You can play the guitar? Well, I guess you wouldn't want one if you couldn't. Wakana: Yeah, a little. Wakana: It's been a few years now, and so I'd like to finally get my own guitar. Shuuji: Huh. My only musical experience comes from music class, though that was ages ago. Hideaki: I could probably play a bit better than Shuuji, then. I had a phase where I was really into music, and so I tried my hand at the guitar. Wakana: Oh, really? That's unexpected. Hideaki: Well, that was a while ago. So? Since you're saving up money, you gonna get a good one? Wakana: Yeah, I'd like a decent one, at least. Though, the prices of musical instruments are pretty crazy. Shuuji: True. Especially vintage instruments. The amount those go for is just bonkers. Wakana: Dad told me to get one with my own money. Would it have killed him to give me at least some of the money for it? Shuuji: So, how did Ayachi-san help you with that? Wakana: She introduced me to a part-time job. Wakana: And now I'm going to finally reach my goal with my next paycheck, meaning I'll be getting my guitar really soon♪ Uhehe. Hideaki: A part-time job, huh? That's nice. Maybe I could have her introduce me to one as well? Wakana: Allow me to read your thoughts: \"Maybe then, I could get closer to her. I could even ask her out on a date to 'repay her' with my first paycheck!\" Hideaki: Is everyone I know a freaking esper?! Shuuji: Look, anyone could guess as much. The fact that she was right just means you're simple. Hideaki: Wh-Whatever! Who cares! Besides, as a guy, I can't let an opportunity to get to know a cute girl like her slip by! Wakana: Well, you have a point... I guess. Shuuji: I'm guessing all the other single guys out there are looking for opportunities too. Student 2: What was it about? I-I want to know... Damn, I'm so jealous of them. Student 3: Damn it... I wanna chat with her too. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Uh... It's nothing. Hideaki: Don't act like this is none of your business. You'd love to get closer with Ayachi-san too, right? Why not get a tarot reading from her? She invited you for one, after all. Shuuji: I dunno... I'll swing by and ask for one once something comes up. Hideaki: What a waste. Wakana: I feel like she wouldn't like it if he went there without a good reason. Hideaki: Huh?! Really? Wakana: Nobody likes a guy who clearly has ulterior motives, you know? Hideaki: Except when you're hot. Wakana: Well, too bad you aren't. Hideaki: Wow! How could you?! Wakana: I don't think girls like Ayachi-san are that shallow. What matters is if you're attractive on the inside, not the outside. Hideaki: I see. Wakana: Besides, people with great personalities wouldn't approach her like that in the first place. Hideaki: Ugh... I guess it's game, set and match for me. Shuuji: Guys, we better head back to class. Afternoon classes are about to start. Wakana: Oh, yeah. Right. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: (Phew...) Shuuji: It's cool. Don't worry about it. Girl: Thanks. Okay then, bye-bye♪ Shuuji: See you tomorrow. Hideaki: So you're still doing this, huh? Shuuji: For today, yeah. It wouldn't be right to turn her down now after I already told her I'd do it. Wakana: Yeah, fair enough. Hideaki: *sigh*... Okay, fine. Want me to give you a hand? Shuuji: Err... Shuuji: I appreciate the sentiment, but no thanks. Hideaki: Knew you'd say that. Wakana: Yeah, it was practically a given. Shuuji: What do you mean? Hideaki: You're a real lone wolf, dude. Shuuji: Okay, look. All I'm doing today is entering some data into their computer database, so I really don't need your help. Shuuji: I'll ask you for help for sure next time something like this happens. Wakana: Stubborn to the end, I see. Hideaki: There's not supposed to be a \"next time.\" You're supposed to turn them down instead. Shuuji: Yeah, yeah. I know. Hideaki: Looks like he's gonna keep on helping people after this. Wakana: That's just how he is. It's not something that can be fixed that easily. Wakana: No point in nagging him about it any further. Hideaki: I'll be on my way, then. What about you, Wakana-chan? Wanna go somewhere if you're free? Wakana: Together with you? Hideaki: Yeah. Wakana: Just the two of us? Hideaki: Yeah! Wakana: Yeah, no way♪ Hideaki: Your blunt replies are too cruel! Wakana: I'm sorry, but I'm busy today. Hideaki: What plans? Wakana: That part-time job. Hideaki: The one Ayachi-san introduced you to? Wakana: Yep. So I don't have time today. Sorry. Hideaki: Work, huh... Well, I guess that's―Huh? Hold on a second. Hideaki: Then why did you ask if it would be the two of us?! Wouldn't that be completely irrelevant?! Wakana: That's just your imagination! Shuuji: If you have school in the day and work in the evening, then doesn't that mean you have no time for homework or studying? Wakana: Yeah, pretty much. I always end up crashing as soon as I come home from work... Wakana: Ugh, our next exams are gonna be rough... Once I get my new guitar, I'm gonna play that bad boy nonstop... Uhehe. Wakana: Oh! I'll be late if I keep standing around chatting like this. See you guys later! Gotta go! Shuuji: See you tomorrow. Hideaki: Don't trip on your shoelaces as you run! Shuuji: Well then, I'll head over to the library now. Hideaki: Yeah, see you. Shuuji: I've been told to come here and register some new books into the library catalog. Committee Girl: Huh? Umm... And you are? I don't remember you being in the Library Committee. Shuuji: I'm filling in for Akita from class 2-A. Apparently, she has something she can't call off and asked me to fill in for her. Committee Girl: Oh, really? If that's how it is... I guess that's alright. Okay, I'm counting on you, then. Shuuji: Sorry, but could you teach me how to do it? Committee Girl: Sure. It's not too hard. Could you sit down at the computer there? Shuuji: Yeah, sure. Committee Girl: So first, you open the database, and then... Okay, there we go. Committee Girl: See the different fields here? Category, title, author, publisher and so on. You have to fill all of them out. Shuuji: I only have to enter the data there and that's it? Committee Girl: Yeah, that's right. Click the register button once they're filled out, and then you'll be back at the main database interface again. Well? Think you can manage? Shuuji: Yeah, probably. Is it okay to ask you if I have any questions later? Committee Girl: Sure thing. Alright, the books you need to register are piled up over here. This is all of them. Shuuji: Got it. Shuuji: Mhm, nnngh... Committee Girl: Umm... You done yet? Shuuji: No, sorry. Shouldn't take much longer, though. Committee Girl: ...Oh. Shuuji: ...... Committee Girl: Huh? Shuuji: I doubt anyone is gonna come by this late anyway, and I can return the key to the faculty room myself once I'm done. Committee Girl: But you aren't on the committee... Shuuji: I've come here to work in place of a Library Committee member. I'm sure me being the one to lock the room up wouldn't be a problem. Committee Girl: You think? Committee Girl: O-Okay then... Could you please handle that for me? Here's the key. Shuuji: Yeah, sure. Committee Girl: Thanks a bunch! I'm off, then! Shuuji: Yeah, bye! Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: ...Hm? Voice: You're kidding me. I came to check up on them since they never came to return the key, and they're nowhere to be seen... I'll need to have a word with them. Girl: Umm, Sensei. Nene: Yes. Time slipped away from me. Sensei: Ah. Well, you shouldn't dawdle around here too much. Nene: Is... there one else here in the library? Sensei: It would seem so. I'm about to lock the room. Nene: I would like you to let me look something up before that. Could you lend me the key? Sensei: You want to look something up this late? Nene: Yes, just something about tarot cards. It won't take much time at all. I'll just need five... no, maybe twenty minutes. Please.  Sensei: ...Well, I suppose I can trust you. Okay, here's the key. Sensei: However, you are to return it to the faculty room within thirty minutes. And make absolutely sure that the room is locked when you leave. Nene: Understood. Thank you very much. Sensei: Alright, goodbye. Nene: Y-Yes... Goodbye... *pant* *pant*... Shuuji: (......?) Shuuji: (...What?) Nene: Ah... ah! Mh... Mhh, mh, mh, mhhh... Shuuji: ...... Nene: Mhh *huff*... *pant* *pant* Ah, aaaah... Fuaaaah... Shuuji: (*gulp*) Nene: No time. I need to hurry, or else... she'll come back... If she sees me doing this... Mhh, mh, mhh, mh! Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah...! Nene: Ah, ah, mhh, mhhh! *pant* *pant* *pant* Ahhh, I'm just the worst! Nene: *paant* *paaant* It feels so good... Ah, ah, aah. So very... good... Mhh! Shuuji: ......

I'm cumming, I'm cumming, I'm cumming, I'm cumming, I'm cumming! Nene: Mhh, mhhhhhhhhhhhh!! Nene: I don't want to move now, but she'll come to check otherwise... I need, to hurry... *pant*... *pant*... But I can't, get any strength, into my body... "

Nene: H-He's right. Nothing strange happened then, nothing strange at...... at all... Nene: ................................................ Nene: ...Nothing happened, okay? Meguru: Holy camole, that was WAY obvious!! Nene: N-No, of course not. I'm a perfectly pure and clean person. I just relieved myself like I― Meguru: Relieved yourself? Of what? Shuuji: %130;Ahhh!

Tsumugi: Oh, hey there, you two.  Tsumugi: Are you feeling better, Ayachi-san? Nene: Yes, I am. Thank you for asking. Tsumugi: Phew, that's great to hear.  Nene: Excuse me changing the subject, but did something happen? The class seems abuzz about something.  Tsumugi: Sorry, I don't know a thing. I didn't get here long before you guys, and it was like this when I walked in.  Shuuji: Huh.  Nene: That is fairly odd.  Wakana: Oh, hey, Hoshina. Good morning. And to you too, Ayachi-san, Shiiba-san.  Tsumugi: Good morning.  Nene: Good morning. Wakana: How're you feeling? Nene: Much better, thank you. But, anyhow... Shuuji: What's everyone talking about? Did something happen? Wakana: Hm? Ohhh, you mean why everyone's so excited. So, get this, you guys. Apparently Hisashima-sensei has a boyfriend! Tsumugi: Did you say Hisashima-sensei? Nene: She has a boyfriend? Wakana: Yeah, someone saw her with him. They're not in our class, but supposedly they saw the two of them together at the station awhile back.  Shuuji: Did you say by the station...? Wakana: No, not really, but it does make you wanna know what kinda guy he is. Shuuji: And that's why everyone's going crazy over it.  Wakana: Man, I really wanna know who he is. Do you think she'll tell us about him if we ask? Tsumugi: Hmm, I don't know. Hisashima-sensei seems like draws a pretty clear line between work and her private life. She might not want to tell us. Nene: Was it the person I saw her with, perhaps? Wakana: Huh? Did you see something, Ayachi-san? Nene: I saw her walking together with a man by the station a while back. Hoshina-kun was there too, so he can attest.  Wakana: Is she right, Hoshina?  Shuuji: We only saw them from afar, but yeah.  Tsumugi: What did he look like?  Shuuji: Hmm... Well, he was tall, older than her, and mature-looking. I didn't get a clear look at his face, but he did seem fairly attractive.  Nene: They made a good couple.  Wakana: Ohh, interesting. Now I'm even MORE curious about this guy.  Nene: It might not be wise to make too much of a fuss over this... Tsumugi: Yeah, it might make her feel uncomfortable during class.  Wakana: I agree with you on that. But still... Shuuji: And a lot of the times that happens without the person in question even being aware of it.  Nene: I wouldn't want to happen to Hisashima-sensei.  Wakana: Well, you might say it was a little careless of her to be walking around town with him so brazenly. "

I could never tell anyone why, and so everyone around me ended up kinda grossed out... Tsumugi: I was really worried if I'd be able to fit in here, but then I ended up making friends right away. That made me so happy. Tsumugi: But... after finding out you're in the same position as I am, I thought for sure that we'd have to stop being friends. Tsumugi: And yet you two fully accepted me... and even still want to be my friend... Tsumugi: Inaba-san treats me normally too... All of that just made me feel so relieved and... so happy. Tsumugi: H-Huh? Oh my. I'm tearing up... Shuuji: Shiiba-san... Shuuji: Y-Yeah... You're welcome. Shuuji: Ahem... Sorry, Ayachi-san. I'm leaving the rest to you. Nene: Huh?

            "Taichi: Uh, hello? You're burning the meat. Shuuji: Huh? Oh, crap! Shuuji: Yeah, you're right. Sorry. Taichi: Thanks for the food. So, something troubling you? Shuuji: Yeah... Dad, has anyone ever asked you, \"what's more important, your work or me\"? Taichi: Where did that come from? Oh, wait, did you actually get a girlfriend? Shuuji: No, this isn't about me. I'm talking about someone else. They came to ask me for help. Taichi: What, really? Man, we really won't be getting a grandchild, darling... Shuuji: You don't need to tell Mom stuff like that. Taichi: The fact that people are coming to you for help shows that you've grown, though. Maybe my dreams really will come true... Taichi: Not with your mother; she was too kind a woman. But someone else did ask me that once. Shuuji: Yeah? How'd you answer? Taichi: I said, \"Let me ask you this: would you prefer me having a job, or being unemployed?\" Shuuji: And then what happened? Taichi: She got really angry and yelled, \"That's not the point here!\" We broke up shortly after. I still don't really understand what happened. Shuuji: You broke up? That's it? Taichi: Yeah. She kept asking me questions like that. Let me tell you, there's no dealing with a woman like that! Shuuji: Yeah... I dunno how I'd think about that. Sounds like it'd be a pain. Taichi: Don't act so picky if you've never even dated anyone. Shuuji: That's harsh, man... Taichi: So, why do you ask? Shuuji: Well, the two of them love each other, but they're struggling to let each other know how they feel. I can't see a solution to the problem. Shuuji: Even if you love someone, you've gotta work, right? But what are you meant to do so that your relationship doesn't fall apart? Taichi: Without just breaking up? Shuuji: Preferably. Taichi: Let's see, then... One thing you could do is take a day off from work and spend that time with your partner. Shuuji: A day off, you say... Taichi: And I don't just mean take them to your work with you. They'd ditch for sure if you did that. Taichi: It's only a temporary fix, but it's a good way to keep both parties happy. Though, the problems will end up coming round again. Shuuji: Yeah... You're right. Taichi: Nothing will change if you keep working the same hours. If it becomes too much of a problem, the two of them are better off breaking up and finding partners who suit their needs more. Taichi: But some people don't want anything to be more important than themselves. That can easily become an irreconcilable difference. It's just who they are, at a fundamental level. Shuuji: Isn't that a little extreme? Taichi: I'm sure even you get lonely and maybe even jealous when you see one of your few friends being friendly with their other friends, right? It's the same in love. Shuuji: Sure, I get lonely, but... jealous? Taichi: Think about if you only had one friend, but that friend had many others. You'd just be one of his many friends. You'd most certainly feel jealous. That's normal. Shuuji: Hmm... Yeah, I guess. Taichi: That's the same kind of situation. If you don't want your partner to be like that, then no amount of talking will fix things. It's a problem with who they are at a basic level. Shuuji: But I doubt you're going to find anyone that perfect, are you? Taichi: Most people get like that, yes. But what's most important is forgiveness and the will to stick together. Shuuji: ...You know, you're pretty smart, Dad. Taichi: Having kids will make you grow up in a hurry. Especially for me, since I have to manage people in my work too. Taichi: Though, I've learned all this after school. It's probably different while you're still there. Taichi: You need to give up on talking this one through. Unless you can change these people's personalities, you're just smoothing over the cracks in the foundation. Meguru: I do! Nene: Okay then, Inaba-san. Meguru: We'll have her confront him! \"Which is more important, me or your team?!\" Shuuji: %130;Are you trying to make things worse?! Meguru: ...Is that a bad idea? Shuuji: Definitely. They'd break up for sure after that! Meguru: Huh, that's weird... It worked in the dating sim I played the other day. I fixed the characters' relationship and got the good ending. Shuuji: 2D and 3D are completely different! Tsumugi: Okay... We could have them set up days with mandatory dates. Like, several times a month. Tsumugi: They have to come to a compromise. Obviously, it's okay for him to focus on basketball, but he needs to spend what extra time he has with his girlfriend. Tsumugi: This way no one has to give up completely on anything, right? Touko: That might work... But don't you think it would put a lot of pressure on Shiba-kun? Shuuji: And wouldn't it be awkward for them to be forced on a date? Tsumugi: Well... I guess. Higo-san might worry about him only being there because he has to. Shuuji: Have your games and manga given you any other ideas, Inaba-san? Ones that don't involve a dramatic confrontation, preferably. Meguru: Errm, let's see... The problem here is that basketball is taking up too much of his time... Meguru: Even though Higo-san's a girl? Touko: She could be the manager. Nene: They would be able to spend time together if she did. Tsumugi: But that doesn't fix their lack of dates, does it? Touko: That's true... Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Actually... Shuuji: That might be a good idea. Meguru: Senpai? Shuuji: The fundamental problem here is that the two of them don't have anything in common that's important to the both of them. Shuuji: Then they'd be sharing a common purpose, a goal they can work together toward. Don't you think Shiba-kun would be happy about that? Tsumugi: She'll start off caring about that one member most, but I'm sure she'll want to support the whole team on their road to the Nationals once she sees how hard they're working. Meguru: I think it's a good idea. Having your girlfriend as your manager, then taking her to the Nationals... That makes for such a good story! Tsumugi: If they agree to this, it would be the easiest solution, right? Touko: But having your girlfriend around might be distracting too. Particularly for his lower muscles♪ Mufufu. Shuuji: ...Togakushi-senpai, a girl your age shouldn't be saying that stuff. Touko: But you're blushing. I bet you're imagining it, aren't you? You naughty boy. Shuuji: I'm not the only one with a red face. Just look at Inaba-san. Meguru: Hey, what are you bringing me into this for?! Tsumugi-senpai's face is just as red! Tsumugi: Whaaa?! D-Don't get me involved too! Touko: Mufufu, maybe you two are just as perverted as him? Meguru: I-I am not perverted! I most certainly am not! Tsumugi: M-Me neither! Anyway, we're trying to solve a problem here! Does anyone have any other ideas?! I think we should go with Hoshina-kun's suggestion! Meguru: N-No objections from me! None at all! Touko: I agree too. Nene: Very well. Then I'll let Higo-san know how Shiba-kun feels and suggest that she joins the basketball club. Nene: Hoshina-kun, Togakushi-senpai, could you go and talk to Shiba-kun for me? Touko: Sure, you got it. Basketball Club Member: Luckily for us, this girl here wishes to be our manager! Student: I'm Higo Mayuko. I'm a beginner when it comes to basketball, but I'll work my hardest to give you all the support you need! Student: But I've never been a manager before... Won't I just get in the way? Shuuji: For the two of them, at least... Basketball Club Member: Now we have double the motivation to win those finals! Basketball Club: Like hell we do! Basketball Club Member A: She's your girlfriend! Basketball Club Member C: Screw this. You're the only one motivated here! Basketball Club Member B: Bringing your love life to the team? Give me a break! Shuuji: The team looks like it's about to collapse... Shuuji: We should have told them that she wasn't becoming a manager just so they'd have more time to flirt... Touko: I think they know that better than anyone, don't you? Student: U-Umm! I plan on taking this seriously and working hard so that you can all get to the Nationals! Student: I've already made some drinks and bottled them up for you. I've also been learning how to bandage and ice injuries. I swear I'll do a great job! Basketball Club Member B: Drinks... A girl's homemade drinks... Basketball Club Member A: Bandaging... Icing... Basketball Club Member C: Skin contact... Basketball Club: Welcome to the team! Basketball Club Member: If any of you get any wise ideas, I'll kick the shit outta you! Shuuji: %130;They're that easy?! Shuuji: Now I feel like they'll break up for a completely different reason... Shuuji: Yeah, you're right. Touko: Love really is amazing. Mm... I'm even more interested in it. Shuuji: Is there anyone you're interested in, Senpai? Touko: Unfortunately not. I've never fallen for anyone before, I'm embarrassed to say... Touko: I called myself a beginner, but I'm actually even less than that. *sigh* I'm completely hopeless. Shuuji: I wouldn't get that down about it... Touko: I mean... I'm starting to worry that I'm simply not capable of love. I'm already this old without having my first love. Touko: I pine after love so badly, but I may never fall in love with anyone... Maybe I'm just destined to grow old and die alone? Shuuji: I don't think that's true. Touko: Really? Shuuji: People like that typically have no interest in love at all. Shuuji: But you're at least interested in love, Senpai, so I think you'll be okay. Touko: I hope you're right... Touko: To be honest, I joined the OC partly because I thought I could learn some more about love by helping people with their romantic troubles. Touko: But it just keeps getting more and more mysterious... It seems like something you have to experience for yourself to understand. Shuuji: Senpai... Maybe you're setting your ideals too high? Touko: Huh? Do I look the type to demand my boyfriend be hot, smart, and earning over a million yen a year? Shuuji: Oh, no, that's not what I meant. I wasn't talking about your ideals for men, but your ideals for love. Shuuji: The woman and her boyfriend that you see in your dreams look really happy, right? Touko: Yes, incredibly happy. Seeing them always makes me envious. Shuuji: Maybe you've seen so much of them that you now think love has to instantly make you as happy as them? Shuuji: That might not be a conscious thought, but something niggling in the back of your mind. Touko: Hmm... I wouldn't be surprised if it was. Shuuji: I'm sure you'll meet the man for you one day, Senpai. Someone who will be even better than your wildest love fantasies. Shuuji: Your love batteries are still charging, is all. Touko: You think so? Thank you. That made me feel a little better. Touko: Are your love batteries charging too then, Hoshina-kun? Shuuji: They certainly are. Touko: Nothing important. I was just thinking about how the two of us are different after all. Shuuji: Huh? You think? Touko: Yeah. Not just with your outlook on love, but with Higo-san's problem too. I never even thought about what was important to them, or if they needed to share something. Touko: I only brought up the idea of her becoming his manager at random. We might both be beginners when it comes to love, but there's still a big difference between us. Shuuji: Ohh, that's what you're talking about... Shuuji: I didn't do anything that great. I'm sure you could have come to the same conclusion if you had a bit longer to think about it. Touko: No way. I would never have thought of that. I'm too boring of a person. Shuuji: You're either being far too harsh on yourself or are way overestimating me here... Shuuji: Actually, I'm sorry! I've been misleading you! Touko: ...? What do you mean? Shuuji: Well, um, you see... Shuuji: All that stuff about what's important to people... I said it like I thought of it all myself, but I was actually just repeating what my dad told me. Shuuji: I was too embarrassed to say I had discussed it with my dad... Shuuji: I know I was overthinking it... But part of me also wanted to seem cool. Shuuji: I had to talk to my dad because I couldn't think of anything, either. So I really haven't done anything special. Touko: I see... That's a bit of a relief. Shuuji: It is? Touko: Yup, it is. I mean, during our date, I told you we were similar, didn't I? Shuuji: I'm sorry. It was all an act. We're similar after all. Touko: We're similar, huh... Shuuji: I'll be honest with you, Senpai... Most days I think to myself about how nice it would be if I had a girlfriend. Touko: ...... Touko: Hey, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Yes? Touko: At the OC we help people with their problems... Is it okay for us to help our fellow club members out when they have a problem? Shuuji: Well... That sounds fine to me. Don't see why it wouldn't be. Touko: Would that include an upperclassman's frivolous worries? Shuuji: It doesn't matter if your problems are frivolous or not. And it certainly doesn't matter if they're older or younger. Shuuji: We've never discriminated over who we help before, and we're not about to start now. Touko: I see... Touko: Then there's something I'd like to ask of you, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: ...Where are you going with this? Touko: Would you study with me? Shuuji: Study with you? I mean, I don't mind, but our midterms only just finished, so... Touko: Not that kind of studying. I'm talking about studying love. Shuuji: ......... Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: ... Shuuji: Come again? Touko: I'm asking if you'll study love with me? Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Whaaaaaaaaa?! "

            "Shuuji: Oh crap, I gotta get back to class! Schoolgirl D: Ayachi-san! Let's start a band together! With your heavenly voice, we'll make it big for sure! Nene: Sorry, but I'm not interested. I was just a stand-in for that one occasion. Schoolgirl D: But didn't the crowd's reaction feel great? Don't you wanna get more of that, on an even bigger stage? I know you can do it, Ayachi-san! Nene: Thank you for the compliment, but I really can't. I'm not good at being in front of crowds. Schoolgirl D: *sigh* Okay, I guess there's no changing your mind. Aww man, we could've hit it big... Schoolgirl D: Oh! But if you ever change your mind and wanna step onto the stage again, talk to me first! You gotta! Nene: *sigh* Very well. Touko: You had it tough today. Here's some tea. Drink it and let it calm your soul. Watch out, though; it's hot. Nene: Thank you, Togakushi-senpai. Nene: *blow* *sip* Ahh, wonderful... Tsumugi: And there were even more people who asked her in our classroom. Meguru: Really? Whoa, that's crazy... Nene: I'm glad that they liked my singing... I just wish they would leave me be. Touko: Now, now, this just shows how wonderfully your band played, doesn't it? Nene: Yes, and that's an honor, and I'm truly grateful, but... it's rather draining... Shuuji: In fact, I'm sure it'll be a lot calmer tomorrow, even. The party is still fresh in everyone's minds. Nene: I hope you're right... Meguru: Should we wrap things up here, then? Nene-senpai's looking pretty rough. Tsumugi: They'll be closing the club building soon, so I doubt anyone else is gonna come to us with their problems. Shuuji: There you have it, Ayachi-san. Let's call it a day so you can take it easy. Nene: ...Very well. Thank you for looking out for me. Touko: Helping people is important, but you're not going to be able to help anyone if you get sick. Touko: I'll take over tidying and locking up, so you can go straight home. Nene: ...Are you sure? Touko: Yup, just leave it to me! Nene: Well then, I'll be excusing myself. Thank you, everyone. Touko: Bye-bye～ Make sure you get some rest! Tsumugi: Wait up! I'll go home with you, just in case. Meguru: Oh, I'll come too. What about you, Senpai? Shuuji: I feel bad making Togakushi-senpai tidy up by herself, so I'll stay and help her out. Tsumugi: Bye, then. Shuuji: Yeah, see you later. Touko: See you tomorrow～ Shuuji: ...... Touko: Oh my, what do you mean? I only made a simple observation. Shuuji: You know what you said, and you clearly did it on purpose. Touko: Mufufu. You're blushing, you know? Shuuji: I'm not used to stuff like this... Go easy on me, please. Touko: Okay, my bad. Well, it's getting late, so how about we start locking up? Shuuji: Yeah, let's. Shuuji: But, before that... Could I have a moment? Touko: Of course. There's no rush. Oh, have you decided to talk to me at last? Shuuji: It's more of a request, I guess? Touko: You need something from me? Touko: Oh, is this about your reward? Decided what you wanted, have you? Go on then, let's hear it. Touko: Please, be honest with me. How can I be of service? Shuuji: I'd just like to talk for a minute if you don't mind. Touko: You want to talk? But isn't that what we're doing right now? Or do you mean you want to talk about sex? Like pillow talk? Oh my, you naughty boy. Shuuji: Could you please cut it out with the dirty jokes? Shuuji: I don't want any kind of special conversation. Certainly not one about sex. I just want us to talk normally so I can learn more about you. Shuuji: I mean, yes, there is a reason I want to talk to you, but we don't have to talk about anything specific... A normal conversation will do just fine, really. Touko: You're really serious about this. My bad. I just went and poked fun at you like normal. Shuuji: No, it's fine. I mean, I know this is a bit out of the blue. Touko: What's this about, though? Why do you want to know more about me? Shuuji: Well, you see, errm... There's no big reason behind it. Shuuji: It's just, we're in the same club, but I barely know anything about you. When I realized that, it started to bother me and made me want to do something about it. Touko: Oh, I see. Shuuji: So I just thought we could hang out together a little, or something. Shuuji: So... is that a no, then? Touko: Chatting itself isn't a problem. I don't mind doing that. Shuuji: Oh, well, that's good... Touko: Well, chatting a little isn't much of a reward, is it? It's just a normal, everyday thing. Touko: So it doesn't feel right. Hmm... Oh, I know. Let's go somewhere on our next day off, just the two of us, and talk there. Shuuji: Huh? Just the two of us? Touko: Yeah, that's right. That'll make it nice and easy for us to talk, won't it? Shuuji: D-Do you mean like... Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Yeah, sounds great. Touko: It's settled, then! Your reward for doing a good job with the Halloween party is a date with me. I sound a bit arrogant, putting it that way. Ahaha. Shuuji: N-No, I don't think you did at all. Thank you very much, Senpai. Touko: No problem. Well then, I'm looking forward to our date. Shuuji: I-I'm looking forward to it too. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: A date with Togakushi-senpai... Shuuji: A date... A date, huh? Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Do I even have any good date clothes?! Hideaki: Yo! Shuuji: Hey. Hideaki: What're you doing here so early? Shuuji: Just thinking about things. Hideaki: If something's bothering you, why not go talk to your friends at the OC? Shuuji: If it was a normal problem, I would. Shuuji: But this is a matter of pride. I can't talk to girls about this. Hideaki: Oho. This sounds interesting―no, I dare say fascinating. Hideaki: Well, we're both men here. You can talk to me about it! Shuuji: Huh? With you? Kaidou...? Hideaki: What's with that reaction? Don't talk smack until you try! I mean, the drum thing worked out, didn't it? Shuuji: That's true. Shuuji: You're being awfully nice today. Hideaki: That's 'cause it looks like something's really bothering you. And now I wanna know what it is. Shuuji: You're really enjoying this, huh? Hideaki: Kinda? But I'm pretty worried too. I'm not gonna laugh at you, I swear. I'll just give you my opinion. Shuuji: The whole reason I'm hesitant is that I know you'll laugh at me. Hideaki: A date, huh? I see, hmm... Hideaki: ...... Hideaki: Pfft, ahahahaha! Even middle schoolers don't worry about that nowadays! Ahahahaha! Shuuji: I thought you weren't gonna laugh! Hideaki: Sorry, my bad. Couldn't help it. Just didn't expect you to be worrying about a date. Shuuji: I think a lot of people worry about dates, actually. Hideaki: I went out and bought new clothes and everything for it. But I was wearing stuff I wasn't used to, so it went horribly. Shuuji: So, do you think I should dress up properly for a date? Hideaki: I dunno. Like, obviously you have to pay attention to your looks, but... I don't think you need to dress fancy or anything. Hideaki: Especially in your case, Shuuji. It's not like you're going on an actual date, right? So the rules for a normal date don't apply. Shuuji: Yeah... You're right. "

N-No I don't! Touko: You liar. You've turned beet red. You were thinking about the other day, weren't you? Shuuji: W-Well... I mean... Shuuji: Hey, you've gone red too, Touko...san. Your mind was in the gutter too, wasn't it? Touko: Yup. Of course it was. Shuuji: See, I knew―Wait, whaaat?! Y-You admitted it?! Touko: I mean, it was my first time, you know? It was a once in a lifetime event shared with you... It's too special an event for me to ever forget. Touko: Of course I remembered it the next time I saw you.

I was so happy I got sidetracked. I wanted to tell you about that. Touko: I dreamed about the same thing last night, but it was different this time. I only saw your mom. Shuuji: I see... Touko: What do you think this is all about? Could I have met your mom somewhere? Touko: This would be really weird if I haven't. Shuuji: That's what I wanted to talk about. Do you think you'll have time to discuss it after club today? Touko: Yeah, I don't have anything planned. Other than going home and making dinner, I guess. Shuuji: Great. Do you mind going to that cafe we ate parfaits at? Touko: Parfaits? Um... Shuuji: The place you, Koshiji-san, and I went to. Touko: Oh, yeah... Right. Their parfaits are delicious. Okay, sounds good. Shuuji: It's a date, then. See you after school. Touko: I'm looking forward to it. Hehe. Nene: Good morning, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Morning, Ayachi-san. Nene: Could I have a moment with you later? It won't take long, so after you've had lunch would be fine. Shuuji: Sure. Want me to come to the clubroom after eating? Nene: Yeah, I'd appreciate it. Thanks. Shuuji: Ah, there you are. Great. Nene: Sorry for calling you out here. Shuuji: It's fine. This must be something serious, right? I assume it has something to do with magic? Nene: Correct. Could you take a look at this for me? Nene: Yes. After you mentioned it to me, I started checking on them. It's been very gradual, but the fragments inside the bottle have been increasing. Nene: This is despite me not retrieving any fragments myself. Shuuji: Which means... Nene: I think the hole in your heart is closing up and returning the fragments to my bottle. Shuuji: Really?! That's great! Nene: Yes. That part is good... What's bothering me is the quantity. Shuuji: What do you mean? Nene: I think the fragments have been returning ever since you started dating Togakushi-senpai. Shuuji: Yeah, I'm sure. I mean, I can't think of another reason. Nene: To be honest, the quantity is too small, given the circumstances. Nene: I'm positive they're returning, but the rate is so slow that I didn't even notice at first. Shuuji: I see... Nene: That's what's been bothering me. Nene: From what I can tell, the two of you look incredibly happy. Yet so few fragments are returning... To be completely frank, it's strange. Shuuji: Which means... there's still a problem? Nene: That's what I've been wondering. Nene: Is there anything you're regretting at present? For instance... Have you cheated on Senpai, or betrayed her in some way that's making you feel guilty? Shuuji: I haven't. And I'd prefer if you don't accuse me of such things. Nene: Of course. I didn't think you were that kind of person... But if that's not it, what could it be? There must be some kind of reason, but... Shuuji: Yeah but, I don't feel guilty about... Ah! Nene: Have you thought of something? Shuuji: The truth is... I haven't told her about my ability yet. Shuuji: I just haven't had a good opportunity to bring it up. Nene: The hole in your heart was caused by your ability in the first place. It's possible that the hole can't be filled in while you still feel burdened by it. Shuuji: I-I see... Makes sense. Nene: Also, don't take this personally, but I've helped a lot of people with their romantic problems, and... Nene: If you leave that burden alone, I think it will eventually cause problems between you and Togakushi-senpai. Shuuji: Yeah, you're right. I feel the same way. Nene: I really hope your happiness continues. But you can't keep going on like this if you want that to happen... Sorry, I've said too much. Shuuji: No, thank you. I understand what you're saying. Nene: There's nothing I can really do here. It's all up to you, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: I'll think it over. I really do care about Touko-san. Nene: Yes, I think that'd be for the best. "

Wakana: You looked like you were having a lot of fun. Shuuji: Yeah, well, things are just a total mess... Hideaki: That girl is from the OC, yeah? Shuuji: Oh, yeah. Inaba Meguru. Wakana: Seems like she's really attached to you. I'm honestly surprised. Shuuji: ...Huh? Hideaki: Yeah. You even brought her with you all the way to our classroom. You walk to school together or something? What the hell, dude? Shuuji: ...It's not like that. I only brought her with me because she wanted to say good morning to Ayachi-san.

Hideaki: Lemme guess, something happen between you two at the Halloween party? Shuuji: Nothing like what you're hoping to hear. Shuuji: Well, err, how should I explain... Nene: She wants to sleep over at my place? Nene: Huh... Shuuji: Anyway, we decided to make that her goal for now. Nene: ...I'm sorry, but I'm not understanding how this all came to be. Shuuji: So, Inaba-san asked me how the two of us got so close... Oh, she's the one who said we were close, not me, okay? Shuuji: And I can't exactly tell her about the witch and fragment stuff, right? Nene: Well... Yes, that's true. Shuuji: So I had nothing to really tell her. I ended up coming up with the idea to sleep over at your place on the spot. Shuuji: But then she said that suddenly staying over would be too big of a hurdle, so we set that as the current goal she'd work towards instead. Nene: But she could stay over any time if she just asks. Shuuji: Yeah, I figured as much. But it seems like Inaba-san doesn't see it that way. Nene: What do you mean...? Shuuji: She really likes you, but the thing is, she isn't brave enough to take the necessary steps to get closer. Nene: ...I sort of understand what you mean. Nene: Inaba-san is very sincere, but feels like a timid puppy at times. Shuuji: You mean like... she'll come running to play with you with her tail wagging, but then has moments where she stops and thinks, worrying about if she's being annoying? Nene: Exactly. You described her perfectly. Shuuji: So you've felt that too, huh... Nene: I think that probably relates to the pain in your chest you mentioned yesterday. Shuuji: I agree. Maybe she has some sort of trauma... Nene: Maybe. It's a plausible explanation. Nene: Otherwise, I don't understand why such a sincere, cheerful and talkative girl would become like that. Shuuji: We can only really guess. Shuuji: Ahh... Yeah. She got really flustered for some reason. Shuuji: Well, you can be rather scary at times... Nene: ――― Shuuji: That! That's exactly what I'm talking about! That face is terrifying! Shuuji: Anyway, I've given this a good deal of thought, and I feel like she hasn't yet accepted that it's okay for her to become closer with you. Nene: Ah, yes. I agree, that seems accurate. Shuuji: So yeah, I'd like to ask for your assistance on that. Shuuji: Could you be patient and kind with her even when she's being awkward? Nene: Of course. Now that I know what's going on, I won't see her behavior as strange anymore. Shuuji: Thanks. I appreciate it. Shuuji: What's the matter? Nene: Oh, nothing. It's just... Nene: The way you've been talking about this is almost like it's your own problem. Shuuji: ...... Meguru: (Right... I'm sorry.) Meguru: (Well, umm... It's in the middle of the week, so there's school tomorrow. It feels weird asking her now...) Shuuji: (Oh right! It would be better waiting until Friday, huh?) Meguru: (N-No. I'd rather ask today. I wouldn't be able to handle the anxiety if I waited!) Meguru: (Besides, I feel like my family would rejoice at the news, so there's no problem there...) Shuuji: (Oh, okay. Well, in that case...) Meguru: (Huh? Wh-What is it?) Shuuji: (Your face is way too close...) Meguru: ...Ah?! Meguru: N-Nothing's wrong! And we weren't having any kind of secret talk. Touko: You're blushing, you know? Mufufuh. Meguru: Th-That's just... Tsumugi: ...... Nene: Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Ah... Y-Yeah. Shuuji: (...Ah!!) Meguru: Wha?! Y-Yeah, what is it?! Shuuji: I've got a good idea. How about you have Ayachi-san give you a tarot reading for a change? Meguru: ...Huh? Shuuji: Actually, she's never read your fortune for you before, has she? Meguru: Y-Yeah, she hasn't... Shuuji: Well then, this sounds like a good chance to get a first-hand taste of our president's fortune telling skills. Meguru: ...... Tsumugi: Oh, come to think of it, she hasn't read my fortune yet either. Touko: Same here. Ayachi-san, could you do it for all of us together? Shuuji: N-No no no! Touko: Whoa, take it easy. There's no need to yell. Shuuji: Oh, uh... Right... Shuuji: Oh! D-Don't you think it'd be better if we did it in the order everyone joined? That way we can experience her fortune telling as individual members. Touko: Oh, yeah. That's not a bad idea. Tsumugi: Then Meguru-chan should go first. Has she already read your fortune, Hoshina-kun? Shuuji: Hm, me? Um, yeah, she has! Touko: You seem really enthusiastic about this for some reason. Shuuji: Well, now that that's settled, go on, Inaba-san. Meguru: O-Okay... but... Meguru: I'm kinda hesitant about this... You see, I tend to totally buy into this stuff and get obsessed with the outcome... Shuuji: Hey! Meguru: (Oh...! R-Right, so that's what this is about. I'm sorry...) Meguru: (But that was really hard to get, Senpai!) Shuuji: (We were literally just talking about this a minute ago. I was hoping you'd get the hint...) Meguru: (W-Well... My mind sorta went blank once I realized how close my face was to yours.) Shuuji: ...... "

            "Kawakami: Yo. Shuuji: Morning, Inaba-san. Meguru: Is everyone here? Shuuji: No, we're still waiting on Nene.  Meguru: Odd. I didn't expect her to be last.  Shuuji: Well, we still have 10 minutes before it's time. She shouldn't be too long... Kawakami: Honestly, I expected you to be dead last, Inaba. Meguru: Mgh. Judging people on appearances is a little rude, you know.  Shuuji: Nah, you're not late or anything. Don't worry about it.  Nene: Sorry... It took me a bit of time to get myself ready... Shuuji: Oh, I see. But hey, the outfit looks great on you. Super cute, Nene. Nene: Th-Thank you... Hehehe. Kawakami: ...Is the difference really that noticeable? I mean, sure, she looks cute like she always does, but I dunno... Meguru: What are you saying? The difference is HUGE. Her hair ends are trimmed, and her cuticles also look perfect. I'd totally bet she's been to a beauty salon.  Kawakami: You serious...? I can't see squat. Heck, like, is it even possible to tell differences in something like trimmed hair ends? Meguru: Actually, popular guys notice these things.  Kawakami: Oh... No wonder Hoshina-senpai did. It's crazy that he's so attentive to detail. Meguru: Hmm... I don't know about that. In his case, I feel like it isn't visual awareness that led to it, but a little thing called \"situational\" awareness.  Shuuji: ...... Meguru: But you better keep in mind, complimenting for the sake of complimenting is a no-no. Kawakami: Ah, okay. Interesting.  Shuuji: ...... Nene: Yes. Kawakami: So where're you gonna be going? Shuuji: Hmm... I like the arcade. Meguru: An arcade for the first place? Very interesting choice. Kawakami: Umm, according to what I've read, arcades aren't a good spot to go on a date... Shuuji: That's just in general. With everything, it really just depends on you and your partner, and your tastes and interests.  Nene: I quite like arcades myself. I've never actually been to one proper, though, so I'm fairly excited for this.  Meguru: Whoa, really?  Nene: I have entered one before, but we were short on time then, so all we did was go to the photo booth. Kawakami: Ohh, okay... Kawakami: So it's the same with dates as it is with shaggin'! Can't go by the books! Shuuji: Yes, but PLEASE don't say that out loud, for Christ's sake!! Meguru: Shaggin? What does that mean? Kawakami: Nah, it's nothing! Just forget I said that, Inaba. Meguru: Hmm. Something smells veeery fishy.  Shuuji: Come on, we're going.  Kawakami: Ah, we're gonna tail you guys from a short distance.  Nene: Oh, you are? I was under the impression we would all stay together... Meguru: Oh no, that'd make things way too awkward for you two.  Kawakami: I wanna know how couples act naturally, is all. If we constantly interrupted y'all with comments and whatnot, that'd pretty much defeat the purpose. Kawakami: Just forget about us two and do your thing. Go on, go on. Shuuji: It's kind of hard to do that when we know we're being watched... Shuuji: No point in dawdling around here forever. Let's go, Nene. Nene: Yes, I'm ready.  Shuuji: If you want, sure. Do you like them? Nene: I do like them, yes... But more so, I thought it would be nice to have some sort of physical object to remember our dates by.  Nene: Do you remember how you suggested we get a cork board before?  Shuuji: So that's what you want... Shuuji: Alright, then! In that case, I'm gonna get you a plushie as a present today. Nene: A plushie? Shuuji: Yep. One from those claw machines. And we can even include it in the picture we take! Nene: Oh, that's a fantastic idea. I'd love that. If you can get one, that'd be wonderful. Shuuji: Almost there, almost there... And, now! Nene: Please don't drop it, please don't drop it... Shuuji: I guess there has to be a way... "

I don't want to live a single day without you! Shuuji: I love you too. Nene: A little... Nene: But right now... I'd prefer that. Shuuji: Are you a masochist or what?  Nene: I could be. Maybe I want you to tie me up. So hug me tight... Don't let go. Shuuji: Maybe today is just different. My heart's so full of love and happiness right now. It feels so much warmer than usual.  Nene: As is mine. Here, see for yourself... Do you feel it? Shuuji: Yeah. I can feel your body so keenly... You're really soft. Nene: Hey, now's not the time for sexual remarks. Also... I don't like the sound of that. It's like you're saying I'm flabby... Shuuji: Sorry, Nene. Nene: More importantly, you haven't properly answered my question. Can you sense my feelings right now? Shuuji: Yeah, I can. I can feel your warmth and love so much... It's making my chest heat up like a furnace.  Nene: I just feel so safe and secure when you hold me like this. I've been alone this whole time... and I was scared. So, so scared... I haven't even been able to sleep properly as of late.  Nene: But tonight I think I'll be able to get a good night's sleep... If I'm not careful, I might not even be able to wait until we get back to the apartment... Shuuji: Is that, um... an invitation? Nene: An invitation for... what? Shuuji: Well, you know... Don't make me spell it out. Nene: Wait... EEK?! N-N-N-N-No, what are you thinking?! I wasn't suggesting we... have sex outside before going back... Get your mind straight! Shuuji: I'll admit I was talking about sex, but I WASN'T talking about doing it outside! Sheesh! Nene: Ah... urk... ughhh... Nene: Look, I wasn't getting at that or whatever you're thinking! I-I really am just sleepy! Shuuji: O-Oh, okay... Nene: We're going to do something tomorrow that... requires energy? Huh? Wait? D-Don't tell me... Y-You want to have tons of rough sex...? Shuuji: What? I was just thinking we could on a date or something... Nene: O-Oh... right. Nene: Ah――!! Wh-Why is my mind so dirty right now... This is so embarrassing... Shuuji: So... what do you want? We can go on a normal date, or we can go to your place and have tons of rough sex. If you want the latter, I can do that. Nene: N-No thank you. The former will do! Shuuji: ...Okay. Shuuji: Not that I mind... But we are in public. Are you okay with people seeing us? Nene: Well... ugh... urgghhhh... That would be embarrassing... But I don't want to move from this place right now. That's more important. Nene: I'm willing to put up with other people seeing if it means I can feel this warmth. So please keep holding me.

Guy: Library Committee? Oh... You mean Akita? Guy: She's probably just playing you. There's a reason people call her the \"mixer queen.\" That thing she can't put off is 100\\% just another mixer. She was even talking about the details in the classroom. Shuuji: Oh, a mixer... I see. I suppose that does involve her future, in a way. Guy: Don't tell me you already knew? Shuuji: Kind of. I didn't know what exactly she was doing, but I did have the feeling it wasn't as important as she made it sound. Shuuji: Well, I could have, but... I just figured that I may as well do it if she already has other plans. Guy: Shuuji... Seriously... Hideaki: Want me to tell them no for you? Shuuji: Don't bother. I appreciate the offer, but I'm not a little child; I'm perfectly capable of saying no when I really don't want to do something. Hideaki: ...And yet I've never seen you do so. Shuuji: Well, I don't have much to do after school, anyway. And it's not like people ask me for help every day. Hideaki: But that doesn't mean you should work for these people while they're out having fun. Hideaki: Whatever. How many times have we had this exchange now? I'm sick of telling you this all the time. Shuuji: Sorry. Shuuji: Not really... I don't have any good reason for it. Shuuji: I just figure that being nice to girls could come in handy someday. Hideaki: At this rate, those leeches will suck you dry, dude. Shuuji: I'm obviously not gonna be as lax with my money. Shuuji: It's just... I can't stand that awkwardness you get when turning people down. Anyway, it's different when I have something to do myself, but I don't mind helping when I'm free. Hideaki: ...I swear, you're gonna get scammed real hard at some point, and it'll suck. Girl: Yeah, I can see it now. It's scary just thinking about it. Hideaki: I know, right? You're with me, aren't you, Wakana-chan? Girl: Yeah. It's not normal to accept every single request, if you ask me. You're not hiding something from us, are ya? Shuuji: Err... Wakana: If I had to guess, maybe he's a hardcore masochist? Shuuji: That's a rather extreme assumption. Hideaki: A hardcore masochist?! I see. So you've been taking on all this work in order to get turned on at school... I never would've expected it... Hideaki: You should've told me we were comrades! Shuuji: Keep your fetishes to yourself, dude! You're freaking me out! Wakana: Huh? You mean having girls work you like a dog DOESN'T turn you on? Shuuji: It really stings to see you so genuinely confused by that. Shuuji: And really, girls shouldn't talk about fetishes in the broad daylight. Wakana: What kind of sexist BS is this? Girls are allowed to talk about sex too. Shuuji: Sure, but usually you keep that sort of talk between girls. Shuuji: You got the hots for me or something? Wakana: Hahaha. Nice joke. I know you don't mean that. Hideaki: Though, it is true that girls talking about that stuff can give us guys the wrong idea. Wakana: Well, we only do so around guys we have no interest in. It's just a normal way to make conversation. Don't read too much into it. Shuuji: Either way, I don't get especially happy or anything when people work me. Hideaki: Yeah, sure. Says the guy who takes every request that comes his way. Shuuji: Well... It's just... Shuuji: Won't girls really like me if I never turn them down? Wakana: Ahahahaha! Not at all. If anything, it makes you look like a dumbass. Shuuji: Man, it stings when you say that so bluntly. Hideaki: You need to turn people down every once in a while. You'll get taken advantage of if you let them think you're so soft. Shuuji: You think I'll get taken advantage of...? Now you're just exaggerating. Wakana: I'm not. There are some nasty girls out there who will totally suck you dry with the way you are now. Shuuji: As if. You're clearly overthinking. Wakana: Tch, tch. You're being naive. Women can be much more calculating than you think. Hideaki: They'll make you pay for their food, for movie tickets, and even for accessories like purses! And all they'll give in return is a \"That was a fun way to kill some time. Thanks! See ya♪\" without any progress between the two of you. Hideaki: And then right after that, they'll suddenly call you and ask you to come pick them up because they missed the last train! For freaking real?! There's mischievous and then there's just plain evil! Wakana, Shuuji: ...... Hideaki: Ah?! S-Sorry guys, all my pent-up frustration just kinda exploded there. Shuuji: Looks like you've been through some serious shit, man. Hideaki: Yeah... I used to mess around a lot. But it's all in the past now. Wakana: That sounds like a real nasty girl you ran into. Shuuji: But getting used like that actually made you happy, didn't it? Hideaki: Well... Yeah, a little. Wakana: Ugh, are you grinning?! What a masochist... Terrifying. Shuuji: I seriously don't get how someone can feel pleasure from being treated so crappily. Hideaki: Hehe... That figures. You two are just greenhorns, after all. Shuuji: I'm not planning on ever becoming a masochist veteran. Shuuji: I wouldn't want that... Alright. I'll be more careful from now on. Hideaki: Have you guys forgotten that I'm right here? Hearing that really hurts, you know? Shuuji: I've got a question. Wakana: Go ahead, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: How do I avoid being taken advantage of while coming off as soft? Wakana: Coming off as soft is already a given? Shuuji: I just feel like I'd get on the girls' bad sides if I suddenly changed my whole attitude, which is scary in its own way. Wakana: Well, I guess that's possible. Hideaki: If you want an example of someone who's kind but doesn't get taken advantage of... Wakana: There's Ayachi-san. Hideaki: Oh, right. She's a perfect example. Girl: Yes? You called me? Hideaki: Whoa! A-Ayachi-san?! Ayachi-san: I'm sorry to have startled you. I just so happened to overhear my name when I was passing by. Ayachi-san: Is there something you need with me? Wakana: Oh, uh, don't worry about us. Your name just came up in our conversation. Hideaki: Yeah, we weren't gossiping about you or anything. Shuuji: Sorry if we offended you. Ayachi-san: Oh no, I'm not upset; I was just curious. Please don't mind me. Ayachi-san: Anyway, Kariya-san, about the thing from before... Wakana: Ah! Yeah, it's going great! That place you introduced me to is awesome! Things are going great thanks to you. Thanks so much! Ayachi-san: I'm happy to hear you like it there. Wakana: I'm really thankful to you. Ayachi-san: Please don't hesitate to visit the clubroom again should something else come up. Wakana: Thanks! I will! Schoolgirl B: Ah, Ayachi-saaan! Thanks for letting me borrow your notebook. You were a life-saver. And I have to say, the notes you took were super neat. You're awesome! Ayachi-san: Oh, it was no big deal. More importantly, are you feeling better now? Schoolgirl B: Yeah, I feel great! Ayachi-san: I'm glad to hear that. Is there anything else that is troubling you? Schoolgirl B: No, nothing at the moment. Ayachi-san: I'm willing to help you out or lend an ear to your worries anytime. It doesn't need to be school related; I'm happy to listen to private or other problems too. Schoolgirl B: Thanks. I'll be sure to stop by if something comes up. Ayachi-san: Yes, please do. Shuuji: Huh? Umm... What do you mean? Nene: I'd be glad to help if something should ever concern you. Shuuji: Oh, thanks. I'm happy for the offer, but there's nothing like that right now. Nene: Is that so? For some reason, I got the feeling that there's something worrying you... Shuuji: Y-Yeah...? Shuuji: Yeah...? Nene: No, I haven't... I just had a gut feeling about it. Wakana: Considering how many people you've helped, I think you're right to trust that feeling. Shuuji: What's that supposed to mean? The part about her helping people. Wakana: Oh, whoops... Right... Sorry, Ayachi-san! You're keeping this from the guys, aren't you? Nene: Oh, no, it's not that big of a secret, so don't worry about it. Nene: It would just be a problem for me if people showed up out of curiosity, so I'm asking that you only keep it to people who actually need help. Hideaki: ...? Did we overhear something we shouldn't have? Nene: It's nothing that big... I'm in the OC. Hideaki: OC? Shuuji: Um, you mean... the Occult Club? Nene: Yes. That's right. Shuuji: I didn't know we had one of those at this school. This is the first I'm hearing of it. Hideaki: Same here. And it's not just a circle, but an actual club? Nene: That's right. It's a club that's been around since before we entered this school. Though, I'm currently the only member. Nene: The Student Council has been on our case because of that... After all, the club doesn't do any sort of exhibitions or the like. Hideaki: So... do you research ghosts or something? Or maybe aliens? Nene: No, I am doing divination. \"Occult\" involves the entire spectrum of the supernatural. I am thankfully able to do as I please since I am the only member. Hideaki: By divination you mean, doing hand signs and being like \"And there we have it!\"? Shuuji: It's impressive how old that reference is. I don't think anyone is gonna get that. Wakana: You instantly recognizing it is just as impressive. I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. You guys are such geeks. Right, Ayachi-san? Nene: I obviously can't do Albino Snake Divination. Wakana: You know about it too?! Nene: Yeah, kind of, but I can only do tarot card reading. Divination is nothing more than a hobby for me, after all. Wakana: Anyway, she's also offering counseling there. Nene: It's really just part of the divination I'm doing. It hardly deserves to be called \"counseling.\" Nene: But if you want, don't hesitate to come over to my clubroom anytime, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Oh, sure. Thanks. Schoolgirl A: Ayachi-saaan! I need your help with our classic Japanese homework! Nene: Oh, of course. I'll be right there. Nene: Okay then. I must excuse myself now. Hideaki: She's almost a little too perfect to be real. Hideaki: But anyway, people consult her for a lot of stuff, huh? I would've expected that to turn into a big rumor. Wakana: It's well-known among girls. It'd be a big problem for Ayachi-san if the guys found out and caused a commotion, though. Hideaki: Ah, is that so... Maybe I should pay her a visit too, and then... Ehee! Shuuji: Allow me to read your thoughts: \"Maybe I could get closer to her.\" Hideaki: Huh?! What?! Espers are real? And you're one of them?! Wakana: What're you talking about? You couldn't have been more obvious. You were practically oozing with sleaze. Shuuji: You're even drooling some. Hideaki: Really?! Oh, you're right! Shuuji: I'm guessing that the girls don't spread that rumor around because of how many guys like you there are. Wakana: That's right. You two better keep this to yourselves. Hideaki: Sure. You bet! Shuuji: So anyway, did you also consult her about something, Kariya? I mean, you just thanked her and all. Wakana: I did. I really want something, but I was worried because I didn't have the money for it. Shuuji: What do you want? Wakana: Well... A guitar. Hideaki: A guitar? Sure didn't expect that. Shuuji: You can play the guitar? Well, I guess you wouldn't want one if you couldn't. Wakana: Yeah, a little. Wakana: It's been a few years now, and so I'd like to finally get my own guitar. Shuuji: Huh. My only musical experience comes from music class, though that was ages ago. Hideaki: I could probably play a bit better than Shuuji, then. I had a phase where I was really into music, and so I tried my hand at the guitar. Wakana: Oh, really? That's unexpected. Hideaki: Well, that was a while ago. So? Since you're saving up money, you gonna get a good one? Wakana: Yeah, I'd like a decent one, at least. Though, the prices of musical instruments are pretty crazy. Shuuji: True. Especially vintage instruments. The amount those go for is just bonkers. Wakana: Dad told me to get one with my own money. Would it have killed him to give me at least some of the money for it? Shuuji: So, how did Ayachi-san help you with that? Wakana: She introduced me to a part-time job. Wakana: And now I'm going to finally reach my goal with my next paycheck, meaning I'll be getting my guitar really soon♪ Uhehe. Hideaki: A part-time job, huh? That's nice. Maybe I could have her introduce me to one as well? Wakana: Allow me to read your thoughts: \"Maybe then, I could get closer to her. I could even ask her out on a date to 'repay her' with my first paycheck!\" Hideaki: Is everyone I know a freaking esper?! Shuuji: Look, anyone could guess as much. The fact that she was right just means you're simple. Hideaki: Wh-Whatever! Who cares! Besides, as a guy, I can't let an opportunity to get to know a cute girl like her slip by! Wakana: Well, you have a point... I guess. Shuuji: I'm guessing all the other single guys out there are looking for opportunities too. Student 2: What was it about? I-I want to know... Damn, I'm so jealous of them. Student 3: Damn it... I wanna chat with her too. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Uh... It's nothing. Hideaki: Don't act like this is none of your business. You'd love to get closer with Ayachi-san too, right? Why not get a tarot reading from her? She invited you for one, after all. Shuuji: I dunno... I'll swing by and ask for one once something comes up. Hideaki: What a waste. Wakana: I feel like she wouldn't like it if he went there without a good reason. Hideaki: Huh?! Really? Wakana: Nobody likes a guy who clearly has ulterior motives, you know? Hideaki: Except when you're hot. Wakana: Well, too bad you aren't. Hideaki: Wow! How could you?! Wakana: I don't think girls like Ayachi-san are that shallow. What matters is if you're attractive on the inside, not the outside. Hideaki: I see. Wakana: Besides, people with great personalities wouldn't approach her like that in the first place. Hideaki: Ugh... I guess it's game, set and match for me. Shuuji: Guys, we better head back to class. Afternoon classes are about to start. Wakana: Oh, yeah. Right. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: (Phew...) Shuuji: It's cool. Don't worry about it. Girl: Thanks. Okay then, bye-bye♪ Shuuji: See you tomorrow. Hideaki: So you're still doing this, huh? Shuuji: For today, yeah. It wouldn't be right to turn her down now after I already told her I'd do it. Wakana: Yeah, fair enough. Hideaki: *sigh*... Okay, fine. Want me to give you a hand? Shuuji: Err... Shuuji: I appreciate the sentiment, but no thanks. Hideaki: Knew you'd say that. Wakana: Yeah, it was practically a given. Shuuji: What do you mean? Hideaki: You're a real lone wolf, dude. Shuuji: Okay, look. All I'm doing today is entering some data into their computer database, so I really don't need your help. Shuuji: I'll ask you for help for sure next time something like this happens. Wakana: Stubborn to the end, I see. Hideaki: There's not supposed to be a \"next time.\" You're supposed to turn them down instead. Shuuji: Yeah, yeah. I know. Hideaki: Looks like he's gonna keep on helping people after this. Wakana: That's just how he is. It's not something that can be fixed that easily. Wakana: No point in nagging him about it any further. Hideaki: I'll be on my way, then. What about you, Wakana-chan? Wanna go somewhere if you're free? Wakana: Together with you? Hideaki: Yeah. Wakana: Just the two of us? Hideaki: Yeah! Wakana: Yeah, no way♪ Hideaki: Your blunt replies are too cruel! Wakana: I'm sorry, but I'm busy today. Hideaki: What plans? Wakana: That part-time job. Hideaki: The one Ayachi-san introduced you to? Wakana: Yep. So I don't have time today. Sorry. Hideaki: Work, huh... Well, I guess that's―Huh? Hold on a second. Hideaki: Then why did you ask if it would be the two of us?! Wouldn't that be completely irrelevant?! Wakana: That's just your imagination! Shuuji: If you have school in the day and work in the evening, then doesn't that mean you have no time for homework or studying? Wakana: Yeah, pretty much. I always end up crashing as soon as I come home from work... Wakana: Ugh, our next exams are gonna be rough... Once I get my new guitar, I'm gonna play that bad boy nonstop... Uhehe. Wakana: Oh! I'll be late if I keep standing around chatting like this. See you guys later! Gotta go! Shuuji: See you tomorrow. Hideaki: Don't trip on your shoelaces as you run! Shuuji: Well then, I'll head over to the library now. Hideaki: Yeah, see you. Shuuji: I've been told to come here and register some new books into the library catalog. Committee Girl: Huh? Umm... And you are? I don't remember you being in the Library Committee. Shuuji: I'm filling in for Akita from class 2-A. Apparently, she has something she can't call off and asked me to fill in for her. Committee Girl: Oh, really? If that's how it is... I guess that's alright. Okay, I'm counting on you, then. Shuuji: Sorry, but could you teach me how to do it? Committee Girl: Sure. It's not too hard. Could you sit down at the computer there? Shuuji: Yeah, sure. Committee Girl: So first, you open the database, and then... Okay, there we go. Committee Girl: See the different fields here? Category, title, author, publisher and so on. You have to fill all of them out. Shuuji: I only have to enter the data there and that's it? Committee Girl: Yeah, that's right. Click the register button once they're filled out, and then you'll be back at the main database interface again. Well? Think you can manage? Shuuji: Yeah, probably. Is it okay to ask you if I have any questions later? Committee Girl: Sure thing. Alright, the books you need to register are piled up over here. This is all of them. Shuuji: Got it. Shuuji: Mhm, nnngh... Committee Girl: Umm... You done yet? Shuuji: No, sorry. Shouldn't take much longer, though. Committee Girl: ...Oh. Shuuji: ...... Committee Girl: Huh? Shuuji: I doubt anyone is gonna come by this late anyway, and I can return the key to the faculty room myself once I'm done. Committee Girl: But you aren't on the committee... Shuuji: I've come here to work in place of a Library Committee member. I'm sure me being the one to lock the room up wouldn't be a problem. Committee Girl: You think? Committee Girl: O-Okay then... Could you please handle that for me? Here's the key. Shuuji: Yeah, sure. Committee Girl: Thanks a bunch! I'm off, then! Shuuji: Yeah, bye! Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: ...Hm? Voice: You're kidding me. I came to check up on them since they never came to return the key, and they're nowhere to be seen... I'll need to have a word with them. Girl: Umm, Sensei. Nene: Yes. Time slipped away from me. Sensei: Ah. Well, you shouldn't dawdle around here too much. Nene: Is... there one else here in the library? Sensei: It would seem so. I'm about to lock the room. Nene: I would like you to let me look something up before that. Could you lend me the key? Sensei: You want to look something up this late? Nene: Yes, just something about tarot cards. It won't take much time at all. I'll just need five... no, maybe twenty minutes. Please.  Sensei: ...Well, I suppose I can trust you. Okay, here's the key. Sensei: However, you are to return it to the faculty room within thirty minutes. And make absolutely sure that the room is locked when you leave. Nene: Understood. Thank you very much. Sensei: Alright, goodbye. Nene: Y-Yes... Goodbye... *pant* *pant*... Shuuji: (......?) Shuuji: (...What?) Nene: Ah... ah! Mh... Mhh, mh, mh, mhhh... Shuuji: ...... Nene: Mhh *huff*... *pant* *pant* Ah, aaaah... Fuaaaah... Shuuji: (*gulp*) Nene: No time. I need to hurry, or else... she'll come back... If she sees me doing this... Mhh, mh, mhh, mh! Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah...! Nene: Ah, ah, mhh, mhhh! *pant* *pant* *pant* Ahhh, I'm just the worst! Nene: *paant* *paaant* It feels so good... Ah, ah, aah. So very... good... Mhh! Shuuji: ......

I'm cumming, I'm cumming, I'm cumming, I'm cumming, I'm cumming! Nene: Mhh, mhhhhhhhhhhhh!! Nene: I don't want to move now, but she'll come to check otherwise... I need, to hurry... *pant*... *pant*... But I can't, get any strength, into my body... "

Shuuji: Well, we still have 10 minutes before it's time. She shouldn't be too long... Kawakami: Honestly, I expected you to be dead last, Inaba. Meguru: Mgh. Judging people on appearances is a little rude, you know.  Shuuji: Nah, you're not late or anything. Don't worry about it.  Nene: Sorry... It took me a bit of time to get myself ready... Shuuji: Oh, I see. But hey, the outfit looks great on you. Super cute, Nene. Nene: Th-Thank you... Hehehe. Kawakami: ...Is the difference really that noticeable? I mean, sure, she looks cute like she always does, but I dunno... Meguru: What are you saying? The difference is HUGE. Her hair ends are trimmed, and her cuticles also look perfect. I'd totally bet she's been to a beauty salon.  Kawakami: You serious...? I can't see squat. Heck, like, is it even possible to tell differences in something like trimmed hair ends? Meguru: Actually, popular guys notice these things.  Kawakami: Oh... No wonder Hoshina-senpai did. It's crazy that he's so attentive to detail. Meguru: Hmm... I don't know about that. In his case, I feel like it isn't visual awareness that led to it, but a little thing called \"situational\" awareness.  Shuuji: ...... Meguru: But you better keep in mind, complimenting for the sake of complimenting is a no-no. Kawakami: Ah, okay. Interesting.  Shuuji: ...... Nene: Yes. Kawakami: So where're you gonna be going? Shuuji: Hmm... I like the arcade. Meguru: An arcade for the first place? Very interesting choice. Kawakami: Umm, according to what I've read, arcades aren't a good spot to go on a date... Shuuji: That's just in general. With everything, it really just depends on you and your partner, and your tastes and interests.  Nene: I quite like arcades myself. I've never actually been to one proper, though, so I'm fairly excited for this.  Meguru: Whoa, really?  Nene: I have entered one before, but we were short on time then, so all we did was go to the photo booth. Kawakami: Ohh, okay... Kawakami: So it's the same with dates as it is with shaggin'! Can't go by the books! Shuuji: Yes, but PLEASE don't say that out loud, for Christ's sake!! Meguru: Shaggin? What does that mean? Kawakami: Nah, it's nothing! Just forget I said that, Inaba. Meguru: Hmm. Something smells veeery fishy.  Shuuji: Come on, we're going.  Kawakami: Ah, we're gonna tail you guys from a short distance.  Nene: Oh, you are? I was under the impression we would all stay together... Meguru: Oh no, that'd make things way too awkward for you two.  Kawakami: I wanna know how couples act naturally, is all. If we constantly interrupted y'all with comments and whatnot, that'd pretty much defeat the purpose. Kawakami: Just forget about us two and do your thing. Go on, go on. Shuuji: It's kind of hard to do that when we know we're being watched... Shuuji: No point in dawdling around here forever. Let's go, Nene. Nene: Yes, I'm ready.  Shuuji: If you want, sure. Do you like them? Nene: I do like them, yes... But more so, I thought it would be nice to have some sort of physical object to remember our dates by.  Nene: Do you remember how you suggested we get a cork board before?  Shuuji: So that's what you want... Shuuji: Alright, then! In that case, I'm gonna get you a plushie as a present today. Nene: A plushie? Shuuji: Yep. One from those claw machines. And we can even include it in the picture we take! Nene: Oh, that's a fantastic idea. I'd love that. If you can get one, that'd be wonderful. Shuuji: Almost there, almost there... And, now! Nene: Please don't drop it, please don't drop it... Shuuji: I guess there has to be a way... "

Guy: Library Committee? Oh... You mean Akita? Guy: She's probably just playing you. There's a reason people call her the \"mixer queen.\" That thing she can't put off is 100\\% just another mixer. She was even talking about the details in the classroom. Shuuji: Oh, a mixer... I see. I suppose that does involve her future, in a way. Guy: Don't tell me you already knew? Shuuji: Kind of. I didn't know what exactly she was doing, but I did have the feeling it wasn't as important as she made it sound. Shuuji: Well, I could have, but... I just figured that I may as well do it if she already has other plans. Guy: Shuuji... Seriously... Hideaki: Want me to tell them no for you? Shuuji: Don't bother. I appreciate the offer, but I'm not a little child; I'm perfectly capable of saying no when I really don't want to do something. Hideaki: ...And yet I've never seen you do so. Shuuji: Well, I don't have much to do after school, anyway. And it's not like people ask me for help every day.

I'm sick of telling you this all the time. Shuuji: Sorry. Shuuji: Not really... I don't have any good reason for it. Shuuji: I just figure that being nice to girls could come in handy someday.

I can't stand that awkwardness you get when turning people down. Anyway, it's different when I have something to do myself, but I don't mind helping when I'm free. Hideaki: ...I swear, you're gonna get scammed real hard at some point, and it'll suck. Girl: Yeah, I can see it now. It's scary just thinking about it. Hideaki: I know, right? You're with me, aren't you, Wakana-chan? Girl: Yeah. It's not normal to accept every single request, if you ask me. You're not hiding something from us, are ya? Shuuji: Err... Wakana: If I had to guess, maybe he's a hardcore masochist? Shuuji: That's a rather extreme assumption. Hideaki: A hardcore masochist?! I see. So you've been taking on all this work in order to get turned on at school... I never would've expected it... Hideaki: You should've told me we were comrades! Shuuji: Keep your fetishes to yourself, dude! You're freaking me out! Wakana: Huh? You mean having girls work you like a dog DOESN'T turn you on? Shuuji: It really stings to see you so genuinely confused by that. Shuuji: And really, girls shouldn't talk about fetishes in the broad daylight. Wakana: What kind of sexist BS is this? Girls are allowed to talk about sex too. Shuuji: Sure, but usually you keep that sort of talk between girls. Shuuji: You got the hots for me or something? Wakana: Hahaha. Nice joke. I know you don't mean that. Hideaki: Though, it is true that girls talking about that stuff can give us guys the wrong idea. Wakana: Well, we only do so around guys we have no interest in. It's just a normal way to make conversation. Don't read too much into it. Shuuji: Either way, I don't get especially happy or anything when people work me. Hideaki: Yeah, sure. Says the guy who takes every request that comes his way. Shuuji: Well... It's just... Shuuji: Won't girls really like me if I never turn them down? Wakana: Ahahahaha! Not at all. If anything, it makes you look like a dumbass. Shuuji: Man, it stings when you say that so bluntly. Hideaki: You need to turn people down every once in a while. You'll get taken advantage of if you let them think you're so soft. Shuuji: You think I'll get taken advantage of...? Now you're just exaggerating. Wakana: I'm not. There are some nasty girls out there who will totally suck you dry with the way you are now. Shuuji: As if. You're clearly overthinking. Wakana: Tch, tch. You're being naive. Women can be much more calculating than you think. Hideaki: They'll make you pay for their food, for movie tickets, and even for accessories like purses! And all they'll give in return is a \"That was a fun way to kill some time. Thanks! See ya♪\" without any progress between the two of you. Hideaki: And then right after that, they'll suddenly call you and ask you to come pick them up because they missed the last train! For freaking real?! There's mischievous and then there's just plain evil! Wakana, Shuuji: ...... Hideaki: Ah?! S-Sorry guys, all my pent-up frustration just kinda exploded there. Shuuji: Looks like you've been through some serious shit, man. Hideaki: Yeah... I used to mess around a lot. But it's all in the past now. Wakana: That sounds like a real nasty girl you ran into. Shuuji: But getting used like that actually made you happy, didn't it? Hideaki: Well... Yeah, a little. Wakana: Ugh, are you grinning?! What a masochist... Terrifying. Shuuji: I seriously don't get how someone can feel pleasure from being treated so crappily. Hideaki: Hehe... That figures. You two are just greenhorns, after all. Shuuji: I'm not planning on ever becoming a masochist veteran. Shuuji: I wouldn't want that... Alright. I'll be more careful from now on. Hideaki: Have you guys forgotten that I'm right here? Hearing that really hurts, you know? Shuuji: I've got a question. Wakana: Go ahead, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: How do I avoid being taken advantage of while coming off as soft? Wakana: Coming off as soft is already a given? Shuuji: I just feel like I'd get on the girls' bad sides if I suddenly changed my whole attitude, which is scary in its own way. Wakana: Well, I guess that's possible. Hideaki: If you want an example of someone who's kind but doesn't get taken advantage of... Wakana: There's Ayachi-san. Hideaki: Oh, right. She's a perfect example. Girl: Yes? You called me? Hideaki: Whoa! A-Ayachi-san?! Ayachi-san: I'm sorry to have startled you. I just so happened to overhear my name when I was passing by. Ayachi-san: Is there something you need with me? Wakana: Oh, uh, don't worry about us. Your name just came up in our conversation. Hideaki: Yeah, we weren't gossiping about you or anything. Shuuji: Sorry if we offended you. Ayachi-san: Oh no, I'm not upset; I was just curious. Please don't mind me. Ayachi-san: Anyway, Kariya-san, about the thing from before... Wakana: Ah! Yeah, it's going great! That place you introduced me to is awesome! Things are going great thanks to you. Thanks so much! Ayachi-san: I'm happy to hear you like it there. Wakana: I'm really thankful to you. Ayachi-san: Please don't hesitate to visit the clubroom again should something else come up. Wakana: Thanks! I will! Schoolgirl B: Ah, Ayachi-saaan! Thanks for letting me borrow your notebook. You were a life-saver. And I have to say, the notes you took were super neat. You're awesome! Ayachi-san: Oh, it was no big deal. More importantly, are you feeling better now? Schoolgirl B: Yeah, I feel great! Ayachi-san: I'm glad to hear that. Is there anything else that is troubling you? Schoolgirl B: No, nothing at the moment. Ayachi-san: I'm willing to help you out or lend an ear to your worries anytime. It doesn't need to be school related; I'm happy to listen to private or other problems too. Schoolgirl B: Thanks. I'll be sure to stop by if something comes up. Ayachi-san: Yes, please do. Shuuji: Huh? Umm... What do you mean? Nene: I'd be glad to help if something should ever concern you. Shuuji: Oh, thanks. I'm happy for the offer, but there's nothing like that right now. Nene: Is that so? For some reason, I got the feeling that there's something worrying you... Shuuji: Y-Yeah...? Shuuji: Yeah...? Nene: No, I haven't... I just had a gut feeling about it. Wakana: Considering how many people you've helped, I think you're right to trust that feeling. Shuuji: What's that supposed to mean? The part about her helping people. Wakana: Oh, whoops... Right... Sorry, Ayachi-san! You're keeping this from the guys, aren't you? Nene: Oh, no, it's not that big of a secret, so don't worry about it. Nene: It would just be a problem for me if people showed up out of curiosity, so I'm asking that you only keep it to people who actually need help. Hideaki: ...? Did we overhear something we shouldn't have? Nene: It's nothing that big... I'm in the OC. Hideaki: OC? Shuuji: Um, you mean... the Occult Club? Nene: Yes. That's right. Shuuji: I didn't know we had one of those at this school. This is the first I'm hearing of it. Hideaki: Same here. And it's not just a circle, but an actual club? Nene: That's right. It's a club that's been around since before we entered this school. Though, I'm currently the only member. Nene: The Student Council has been on our case because of that... After all, the club doesn't do any sort of exhibitions or the like. Hideaki: So... do you research ghosts or something? Or maybe aliens? Nene: No, I am doing divination. \"Occult\" involves the entire spectrum of the supernatural. I am thankfully able to do as I please since I am the only member. Hideaki: By divination you mean, doing hand signs and being like \"And there we have it!\"? Shuuji: It's impressive how old that reference is. I don't think anyone is gonna get that. Wakana: You instantly recognizing it is just as impressive. I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. You guys are such geeks. Right, Ayachi-san? Nene: I obviously can't do Albino Snake Divination. Wakana: You know about it too?! Nene: Yeah, kind of, but I can only do tarot card reading. Divination is nothing more than a hobby for me, after all. Wakana: Anyway, she's also offering counseling there. Nene: It's really just part of the divination I'm doing. It hardly deserves to be called \"counseling.\" Nene: But if you want, don't hesitate to come over to my clubroom anytime, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Oh, sure. Thanks. Schoolgirl A: Ayachi-saaan! I need your help with our classic Japanese homework! Nene: Oh, of course. I'll be right there. Nene: Okay then. I must excuse myself now. Hideaki: She's almost a little too perfect to be real. Hideaki: But anyway, people consult her for a lot of stuff, huh? I would've expected that to turn into a big rumor. Wakana: It's well-known among girls. It'd be a big problem for Ayachi-san if the guys found out and caused a commotion, though. Hideaki: Ah, is that so... Maybe I should pay her a visit too, and then... Ehee! Shuuji: Allow me to read your thoughts: \"Maybe I could get closer to her.\" Hideaki: Huh?! What?! Espers are real? And you're one of them?! Wakana: What're you talking about? You couldn't have been more obvious. You were practically oozing with sleaze. Shuuji: You're even drooling some. Hideaki: Really?! Oh, you're right! Shuuji: I'm guessing that the girls don't spread that rumor around because of how many guys like you there are. Wakana: That's right. You two better keep this to yourselves. Hideaki: Sure. You bet! Shuuji: So anyway, did you also consult her about something, Kariya? I mean, you just thanked her and all. Wakana: I did. I really want something, but I was worried because I didn't have the money for it. Shuuji: What do you want? Wakana: Well... A guitar. Hideaki: A guitar? Sure didn't expect that. Shuuji: You can play the guitar? Well, I guess you wouldn't want one if you couldn't. Wakana: Yeah, a little. Wakana: It's been a few years now, and so I'd like to finally get my own guitar. Shuuji: Huh. My only musical experience comes from music class, though that was ages ago. Hideaki: I could probably play a bit better than Shuuji, then. I had a phase where I was really into music, and so I tried my hand at the guitar. Wakana: Oh, really? That's unexpected. Hideaki: Well, that was a while ago. So? Since you're saving up money, you gonna get a good one? Wakana: Yeah, I'd like a decent one, at least. Though, the prices of musical instruments are pretty crazy. Shuuji: True. Especially vintage instruments. The amount those go for is just bonkers. Wakana: Dad told me to get one with my own money. Would it have killed him to give me at least some of the money for it? Shuuji: So, how did Ayachi-san help you with that? Wakana: She introduced me to a part-time job. Wakana: And now I'm going to finally reach my goal with my next paycheck, meaning I'll be getting my guitar really soon♪ Uhehe. Hideaki: A part-time job, huh? That's nice. Maybe I could have her introduce me to one as well? Wakana: Allow me to read your thoughts: \"Maybe then, I could get closer to her. I could even ask her out on a date to 'repay her' with my first paycheck!\" Hideaki: Is everyone I know a freaking esper?! Shuuji: Look, anyone could guess as much. The fact that she was right just means you're simple. Hideaki: Wh-Whatever! Who cares! Besides, as a guy, I can't let an opportunity to get to know a cute girl like her slip by! Wakana: Well, you have a point... I guess. Shuuji: I'm guessing all the other single guys out there are looking for opportunities too. Student 2: What was it about? I-I want to know... Damn, I'm so jealous of them. Student 3: Damn it... I wanna chat with her too. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Uh... It's nothing. Hideaki: Don't act like this is none of your business. You'd love to get closer with Ayachi-san too, right? Why not get a tarot reading from her? She invited you for one, after all. Shuuji: I dunno... I'll swing by and ask for one once something comes up. Hideaki: What a waste. Wakana: I feel like she wouldn't like it if he went there without a good reason. Hideaki: Huh?! Really? Wakana: Nobody likes a guy who clearly has ulterior motives, you know? Hideaki: Except when you're hot. Wakana: Well, too bad you aren't. Hideaki: Wow! How could you?! Wakana: I don't think girls like Ayachi-san are that shallow. What matters is if you're attractive on the inside, not the outside. Hideaki: I see. Wakana: Besides, people with great personalities wouldn't approach her like that in the first place. Hideaki: Ugh... I guess it's game, set and match for me. Shuuji: Guys, we better head back to class. Afternoon classes are about to start. Wakana: Oh, yeah. Right. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: (Phew...) Shuuji: It's cool. Don't worry about it. Girl: Thanks. Okay then, bye-bye♪ Shuuji: See you tomorrow. Hideaki: So you're still doing this, huh? Shuuji: For today, yeah. It wouldn't be right to turn her down now after I already told her I'd do it. Wakana: Yeah, fair enough. Hideaki: *sigh*... Okay, fine. Want me to give you a hand? Shuuji: Err... Shuuji: I appreciate the sentiment, but no thanks. Hideaki: Knew you'd say that. Wakana: Yeah, it was practically a given. Shuuji: What do you mean? Hideaki: You're a real lone wolf, dude. Shuuji: Okay, look. All I'm doing today is entering some data into their computer database, so I really don't need your help. Shuuji: I'll ask you for help for sure next time something like this happens. Wakana: Stubborn to the end, I see. Hideaki: There's not supposed to be a \"next time.\" You're supposed to turn them down instead. Shuuji: Yeah, yeah. I know. Hideaki: Looks like he's gonna keep on helping people after this. Wakana: That's just how he is. It's not something that can be fixed that easily. Wakana: No point in nagging him about it any further. Hideaki: I'll be on my way, then. What about you, Wakana-chan? Wanna go somewhere if you're free? Wakana: Together with you? Hideaki: Yeah. Wakana: Just the two of us? Hideaki: Yeah! Wakana: Yeah, no way♪ Hideaki: Your blunt replies are too cruel! Wakana: I'm sorry, but I'm busy today. Hideaki: What plans? Wakana: That part-time job. Hideaki: The one Ayachi-san introduced you to? Wakana: Yep. So I don't have time today. Sorry. Hideaki: Work, huh... Well, I guess that's―Huh? Hold on a second. Hideaki: Then why did you ask if it would be the two of us?! Wouldn't that be completely irrelevant?! Wakana: That's just your imagination! Shuuji: If you have school in the day and work in the evening, then doesn't that mean you have no time for homework or studying? Wakana: Yeah, pretty much. I always end up crashing as soon as I come home from work... Wakana: Ugh, our next exams are gonna be rough... Once I get my new guitar, I'm gonna play that bad boy nonstop... Uhehe. Wakana: Oh! I'll be late if I keep standing around chatting like this. See you guys later! Gotta go! Shuuji: See you tomorrow. Hideaki: Don't trip on your shoelaces as you run! Shuuji: Well then, I'll head over to the library now. Hideaki: Yeah, see you. Shuuji: I've been told to come here and register some new books into the library catalog. Committee Girl: Huh? Umm... And you are? I don't remember you being in the Library Committee. Shuuji: I'm filling in for Akita from class 2-A. Apparently, she has something she can't call off and asked me to fill in for her. Committee Girl: Oh, really? If that's how it is... I guess that's alright. Okay, I'm counting on you, then. Shuuji: Sorry, but could you teach me how to do it? Committee Girl: Sure. It's not too hard. Could you sit down at the computer there? Shuuji: Yeah, sure. Committee Girl: So first, you open the database, and then... Okay, there we go. Committee Girl: See the different fields here? Category, title, author, publisher and so on. You have to fill all of them out. Shuuji: I only have to enter the data there and that's it? Committee Girl: Yeah, that's right. Click the register button once they're filled out, and then you'll be back at the main database interface again. Well? Think you can manage? Shuuji: Yeah, probably. Is it okay to ask you if I have any questions later? Committee Girl: Sure thing. Alright, the books you need to register are piled up over here. This is all of them. Shuuji: Got it. Shuuji: Mhm, nnngh... Committee Girl: Umm... You done yet? Shuuji: No, sorry. Shouldn't take much longer, though. Committee Girl: ...Oh. Shuuji: ...... Committee Girl: Huh? Shuuji: I doubt anyone is gonna come by this late anyway, and I can return the key to the faculty room myself once I'm done. Committee Girl: But you aren't on the committee... Shuuji: I've come here to work in place of a Library Committee member. I'm sure me being the one to lock the room up wouldn't be a problem. Committee Girl: You think? Committee Girl: O-Okay then... Could you please handle that for me? Here's the key. Shuuji: Yeah, sure. Committee Girl: Thanks a bunch! I'm off, then! Shuuji: Yeah, bye! Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: ...Hm? Voice: You're kidding me. I came to check up on them since they never came to return the key, and they're nowhere to be seen... I'll need to have a word with them. Girl: Umm, Sensei. Nene: Yes. Time slipped away from me. Sensei: Ah. Well, you shouldn't dawdle around here too much. Nene: Is... there one else here in the library? Sensei: It would seem so. I'm about to lock the room. Nene: I would like you to let me look something up before that. Could you lend me the key? Sensei: You want to look something up this late? Nene: Yes, just something about tarot cards. It won't take much time at all. I'll just need five... no, maybe twenty minutes. Please.  Sensei: ...Well, I suppose I can trust you. Okay, here's the key. Sensei: However, you are to return it to the faculty room within thirty minutes. And make absolutely sure that the room is locked when you leave. Nene: Understood. Thank you very much. Sensei: Alright, goodbye. Nene: Y-Yes... Goodbye... *pant* *pant*... Shuuji: (......?) Shuuji: (...What?) Nene: Ah... ah! Mh... Mhh, mh, mh, mhhh... Shuuji: ...... Nene: Mhh *huff*... *pant* *pant* Ah, aaaah... Fuaaaah... Shuuji: (*gulp*) Nene: No time. I need to hurry, or else... she'll come back... If she sees me doing this... Mhh, mh, mhh, mh! Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah...! Nene: Ah, ah, mhh, mhhh! *pant* *pant* *pant* Ahhh, I'm just the worst! Nene: *paant* *paaant* It feels so good... Ah, ah, aah. So very... good... Mhh! Shuuji: ...... Nene: *pant* *pant* *pant* *paaant*... Ah, ah, ah... ah... Aaaah, mh, mh, mhhh! Nene: Aaaaaah... I can't stop anymore... *slurp*... *pant* *pant*... Aaahhhh! Nene: I want to cum already, I wanna cum... I just want to cum now... *pant* *pant* *pant* Ahh, ah, ah, ah, ah, aaah! Nene: Ah... ah, ah, ah! Ah, ah, ah, aaaaaah! I'm cumming, I'm cumming, I'm cumming, I'm cumming, I'm cumming! Nene: Mhh, mhhhhhhhhhhhh!! Nene: I don't want to move now, but she'll come to check otherwise... I need, to hurry... *pant*... *pant*... But I can't, get any strength, into my body... "

Shuuji: Ohh, that looks great, Shiiba-san. It's not a huge change, but you come off completely differently now. You really look like a girl. Tsumugi: Y-You think? Ehehe... It's a little embarrassing to hear that, but I'm happy. Tsumugi: This is such a relief. I've actually found something I can―Ah... Urgh! Shuuji: Something you can... \"urgh\"? Meguru: Huh? Wait, do you not like it or something? Shuuji: ...? Tsumugi: Urgh! Shuuji: Whoa, what?! What's wrong, Shiiba-san?! Nene: Keep it together, Shiiba-san! Tsumugi: *baaaaaaaarf* Tsumugi: I've made such a mess... I'm so sorry. Shuuji: Oh, no. You don't have to apologize. Nene: Are you okay? You should take it easy and go home early if you're still feeling sick. Meguru: I'm sorry. I got a little carried away there. Tsumugi: No, it's not your fault. That was just, umm... a physical condition of mine acting up. Shuuji: A physical condition? Meguru: You mean, like, how some people get a stomach ache when they're nervous? Tsumugi: I guess it's sorta like that. But it's not about nervousness at all. In my case, it's, umm... Tsumugi: I can't hold it in whenever I dress like a girl. Meguru: When you dress like a girl...? Shuuji: And by you can't hold it in, you mean that you barf? Tsumugi: ...... Shuuji: Could be... Meguru: Do you have some sort of trauma involving girl's clothing or something? Shuuji: Hey, should you really be asking her that? Meguru: Oh, you're right! I'm sorry for blurting out such a personal question like that... Tsumugi: No, it's okay. I don't have any traumas or anything. I actually really like girl's clothes. Meguru: So it's just a super rare physical condition? Tsumugi: Ah... Yeah, something like that... Shuuji: ...Hm? Nene: Hoshina-kun, is something the matter? Shuuji: Ah, no... It's nothing. Tsumugi: Yeah... I can push things to some degree, but it's hard to know when I'll reach my limit. Meguru: But then you hit that limit and ended up puking anyway... Tsumugi: ...I'm really sorry. I was so happy at the prospect of looking girly that I forgot myself... I thought I could handle some more. Tsumugi: I know... I'm weird, aren't I? Meguru: Well, that just means that instead of changing your hairstyle, we should start with smaller accessories next time! Tsumugi: ...Huh? Meguru: What? You don't want to? Should I stop trying to push this stuff on you? Tsumugi: N-No! That's not it! I'm actually really happy! Tsumugi: But... doesn't my condition put you off? Meguru: Huh? No, of course not! Meguru: It's only got me more pumped, actually! Now I want to do whatever it takes to make you look girly! Tsumugi: ...... Meguru: Ah! That's only if you're willing to try, of course. Tsumugi: I would love to take you up on that... Meguru: Then let's give this our best! Tsumugi: O-Okay! Thank you... Thank you so much, Inaba-san! I'm really looking forward to it! Meguru: Oh, please. This isn't that big a deal! Shuuji: ...... Nene: I don't know... I'd love help if possible, but there's only so much we can do if we're fighting against a physical condition. Shuuji: You're right, but there's something that I― Nene: Ah, please come in! Touko: Pardon me. Touko: Hey there! You all working hard? Shuuji: Togakushi-senpai? Nene: What brings you here? Is there something you need to relay to us? Touko: Nah. I'm here for something else today. I need your help with something, actually. Nene: By that, you mean you're here to consult us on a problem? Touko: Yep. Your club helps out other students, yeah? Nene: Yes... But I find it unusual that you would come for our help. Touko: Yeah, I usually try to handle things myself. I'm in a bit over my head this time, though. Touko: So, could I please have your help? Nene: Of course. We'll gladly help out in any way we can. Touko: Thanks. I really appreciate it! Nene: Hoshina-kun, about what you were trying to say... Shuuji: Oh, don't worry about it. Togakushi-senpai's problem is more important right now. Nene: I see... Then please tell me about it some other day. Touko: By the way, who are those two? I haven't seen them around before. Are they new members? I did receive a report on something like that... Touko: Huh? I'm pretty sure the report mentioned only one new member. Meguru: Ah, yeah! That was probably about me. I'm Inaba Meguru from class 1-D. Touko: Nice to meet you. I'm the Student Council president, Togakushi Touko. Tsumugi: And, um, I may be in a boy's uniform, but I'm a perfectly normal girl! I'm Shiiba Tsumugi. I transferred into class 2-A today! Touko: Ahh, right, right. I heard that I girl with some special circumstances transferred in today. Touko: Right, so that's you, huh? Now I know what they meant by \"special circumstances.\" Tsumugi: There are some private reasons why I have to dress like this... I'm sorry. Touko: Don't worry about it. The school gave permission, so it's all good. I don't see a problem with having a girl like you here. Touko: So anyway, did you join the Occult Club too? Tsumugi: Only on a trial basis. I think I'll join if I can manage to keep up. Touko: Oho... I see your harem is growing, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: That's not what I'm going for, and you know it. Touko: Oh, please～ I know you're thrilled about this. You're living every boy's dream. As a healthy young man, you must have it pretty \"hard,\" huh? Mufufu. Shuuji: Stop with the terrible dirty jokes! Shuuji: We all take this club very seriously! Touko: Okay, okay. That's good to hear. Touko: Shiiba-san, let's get along. Feel free to come to me if there's anything you ever need help with. Tsumugi: Okay. Thank you, Togakushi-senpai. Touko: Then again... I plan on retiring very soon. Tsumugi: Oh. Is that so? Touko: It's already fall, after all. That's when the president retires―or at least, that's how it usually goes. I don't know what's going to happen this time, though... Shuuji: Huh? What do you mean by that? It's not like you won't retire, right? Touko: Of course I'm going to. I'm not about to spend another year here. The problem is the next president... Nene: That's right... The presidential candidates haven't been announced yet. Nene: Considering the time of the year, won't it be a problem if they're not announced soon? Shuuji: Would it? Touko: We would love to, but... I'm in a bit of a bind regarding that. Shuuji: That's what you've come to the OC for? Touko: Yep. That's what I'd like your help with. Shuuji: Umm, incidentally, is it okay for you to be telling us this stuff? Touko: Don't worry. None of it is exactly top-secret information. Nene: So, what is the problem? Touko: The fact is, there are no candidates yet. We don't have any to announce. With the way things are going, I might have to retire without anyone to take over. Shuuji: Wow, that's a pretty serious problem. Meguru: Umm, do you usually have a lot of candidates every year? I'm still a first-year, so I don't know... Meguru: But I feel like seeing more than one would be pretty weird. Touko: That's generally how it is here. We never have enough candidates for a real election, so we just run an approval vote. Shuuji: But it looks like even an approval vote won't be possible this year, huh? Touko: For lesser posts like secretary or vice president, we can decide the president first and then have them appoint everyone else. Nene: But that approach isn't possible if you don't have a presidential candidate to begin with. Touko: That's right. So I just don't know what to do anymore... Nene: But, Togakushi-senpai, I thought you usually have one of the current second-year Student Council members run. Touko: True, that is how it often goes. I used to be the secretary. But it's just a custom; I can't force anyone. Shuuji: Is there anyone who'd be fit for office from your point of view? Touko: There is. My current vice president, Koshiji-san. Touko: She's super cute! And her skin is really smooth. She's a very charming girl. Shuuji: None of that has anything to do with her qualifications. Koshiji-san, though... I think she'd do a good job. Meguru: Do you know her, Senpai? Shuuji: I was in the same class as her last year. I even filled in for her class rep duties a few times because the Student Council kept her so busy. Shuuji: She was actually the vice president? Touko: She was the treasurer and became the vice president following last fall's elections. Meguru: ...Senpai, you should pay more attention to these things. Shuuji: Well, err... Yeah, you're right. Though, I don't think many students here pay much attention to the Student Council. Touko: Tell me about it. The whole reason we have no candidates is because nobody seems to care. Touko: We've even been handing out fliers to let everyone know about our lack of candidates, you know? Shuuji: Oh, that's right. I saw you talking to Koshiji-san? Was that maybe about this? Touko: You saw that? How embarrassing... But you're right. I asked her to run, but she turned me down. Touko: She's got a magnetic personality and has been a member of the Student Council since she was a freshman. She's way more capable than I am. I would've been thrilled if she took over. Tsumugi: Why doesn't she want to run? Touko: She wouldn't say. And not only is she not running, she's quitting the Student Council outright. Shuuji: Is this sudden? Has she shown signs of wanting to quit before? Touko: Nope. She took everyone on the council by surprise. We were all convinced that she'd run for president. Tsumugi: Do you think she got fed up with Student Council work? Touko: Not from what I can tell, I don't think... Touko: Her attendance rate is very high, and she always happily does her job. She often stays late with me, after everyone else has already gone home. Tsumugi: Then what could be the reason? Shuuji: Is this just, like, a sudden change of heart? I dunno why she wouldn't tell you the reason, though. Nene: Can we take it that you want us to convince Koshiji-san to stay, then? Touko: Ah, no, sorry. Like I said earlier, I can't force anyone. Touko: I don't want you to convince her. I want you to help me find another candidate. Nene: Is there no one else in the Student Council who wants to run? Touko: Hmm, not really... Everyone else thinks Koshiji-san is perfect for the job, so they're all hesitating, or more like, afraid to take on that role for themselves. Touko: I may have a member run as a last resort, but I'm hoping someone steps up on their own. It'd be awfully nice if we could find a willing regular student. Touko: There are a lot of students like Hoshina-kun who aren't very clued-in, yeah? I'm hoping that there's someone out there who will step up once they hear what's happening. Nene: Okay, I understand the situation now. Touko: So... Can I take it that you're going to help me? Nene: Yes. I don't know how much we'll be able to help, but we'll do what we can. Touko: Thanks! You're the best! Nene: So, if you don't mind, I'd like to ask a few questions about the Student Council... Touko: And that's about all you need to know. Nene: Thank you for the explanation. I suppose we'll just have to ask around. Meguru: Umm, can first-years run for president? Touko: They can. Second-years running is just a custom, not a rule. There have been some first-year presidents, actually. Touko: Are you interested, Inaba-san? Would you like some... private tutoring? I'll teach you everything you need to know and then some, with just the two of us... Mufufu! Meguru: N-No thanks! I don't swing that way! And I doubt I'd be a very good president, anyway. Meguru: I'll ask my friends to see if anyone's interested. Touko: Yeah? Bummer. As long as you have the motivation for it, you don't need to worry about the actual work; you'll have the help of everyone on the council. Meguru: Got it. I'll let them know that. Touko: On that note, I would even welcome a fresh transfer student, as long as they were motivated. Tsumugi: Umm... I'll give it some thought. Touko: Okay, please do. Touko: Alright, then. I'm sorry for asking you all to pick up my slack, but... Nene: We will do what we can. Shuuji: Honestly? I kinda doubt it. Tsumugi: I'm sorry. I don't think I'll be able to be of any help since I've just transferred. Shuuji: Don't worry about it. I doubt any of us will be able to do much. Nene: That's right. All we can do anyway is ask everyone we know if they're interested in running. Meguru: Who knows, maybe we'll find someone who'll immediately agree to run when asked. Nene: Yeah, maybe. We shouldn't go into this assuming that we'll fail. Meguru: Alright, let's give this our best starting tomorrow! "

She was dressed in the school uniform, but there was something about her demeanor that seemed...off. A bit too polished, perhaps? As the president of the School Occult Club, I've met my fair share of unique individuals, but this girl's aura was undeniably captivating.\n\n\"Welcome to our little corner of the world,\" I said with a bright smile, gesturing for her to come closer.

            "Shuuji: Sorry for coming here so early. Nanao: That's not a problem. I have to get ready to open the store anyway. Nanao: More importantly, you must have something you need to talk about... Maybe about the girl you brought here yesterday. Shuuji: Yes... Did you notice anything? Nanao: Well... Nanao: I presume this is rather serious if you're visiting so early? Shuuji: Yeah... Apparently, Touko-san has been having these dreams. Dreams about a certain woman. Shuuji: It's strange enough that I would never normally believe it. But the past month or two has already been rather strange for me, anyway. Shuuji: So I started thinking, maybe Touko-san has some kind of connection to magic too? Perhaps... she's actually a witch? Nanao: No, she isn't. The presence of magic I feel from her is too weak for her to be a witch. Nanao: To be honest, it's even weaker than the presence I feel from you. There isn't enough magic present in her to grant her any kind of special power. Shuuji: Ah! Then maybe she's like me, and her mom was a witch, and she inherited some of the power? Nanao: Inherited it... No, the presence I feel is very different from yours. Nanao: Do you know anything about her parents? Shuuji: No. Touko-san was an orphan. She told me she was raised in an orphanage. Nanao: She doesn't have parents? Shuuji: It seems not. She said she tried researching them once but wasn't able to find anything about them. Nanao: Something unknown to me... No, wait. Could it be... Shuuji: Huh? Closer to you? Wait, then... Nanao: The presence I feel from her is that of an alp's. Shuuji: Touko-san's an... alp? Nanao: That girl sees dreams about your mother. Nanao: So then, isn't it possible for her to be the alp that signed your mother's contract? Shuuji: Touko-san, and my mom...? Nanao: Though, I'm the one who needs to calm down. I only just arrived at that conclusion myself. I need some time to collect my thoughts. Shuuji: R-Right... Shuuji: Yeah... Yeah, you're right. Nanao: I'll make you a drink. Is the usual house blend okay? Shuuji: Yes, please. Thanks. Nanao: It'll be ready in a moment. Nanao: Here's your coffee. Shuuji: Thank you. Shuuji: It's fine. Does this mean you're ready to continue? Nanao: Yes. Nanao: I've thought it through again, but my conclusion is no different. She's an alp. That's the only thing that makes sense. Shuuji: So, you mean Touko-san is an animal who is assuming the form of a human? Nanao: Yes, but... the presence I feel from her is too weak. And it's strange I wasn't able to recognize one of my own kind at first. Nanao: She's hiding something. Nanao: This is just a baseless theory of mine, but... it's possible that she's a \"former\" alp. Shuuji: What do you mean by that? Nanao: I told you before, didn't I? We're not just interested in humans―we want to become them. So much so that we use magic to look like them. That's our goal. Shuuji: Which means that Senpai achieved her goal and became human...? Nanao: Yes. She isn't an orphan because her parents abandoned her. She's an orphan because she had no human parents to begin with. Shuuji: H-Hold on a second. She told me she has an inheritance! That's what she's been living off of all this time! Nanao: Well... That was probably set up by the person in question. Shuuji: You mean by Touko-san? Nanao: Before she was human, back when she was an alp. Nanao: It's likely that she stored up some magic, then decided to live as a human when she became able to understand them enough. Nanao: When an alp decides to do that, they must throw away all of their powers and memories and start life anew as a human child. Nanao: The dreams she's seeing are memories from when she was an alp. That's why the time scale doesn't add up. Shuuji: Wouldn't that mean she hasn't thrown away her memories? Nanao: The alp must intend to do so, but oftentimes memories cannot be entirely cast aside and will manifest subconsciously in dreams. Nanao: It must be a very important memory to her. Has she said anything about the dreams? Shuuji: That she wanted to be like the woman in her dreams. And that she wanted to be as happy as her. Nanao: Hmm... Perhaps your mother was the one who inspired her to live as a human. Nanao: That yearning for happiness must have been present when she was an alp. A desire strong enough to make her want to become fully human won't just disappear from her memory. Nanao: That's all that I've deduced. Shuuji: ...... Nanao: No, it isn't. Even us alps can't normally resist the effects of magic. Nanao: It was most likely part of your mother's contract. She was granted magic that let her read the minds of everyone but her alp. That condition must have been passed down as well. Nanao: Makes sense, don't you think? Of course, it doesn't line up perfectly, but that's all I can think of right now. Shuuji: If that's the reason, then she must have had a good reason to not want her mind read, right? Shuuji: Why would that be? Nanao: Sorry, but there's no way for me to answer that. Shuuji: Yeah... You're right, sorry. That came off a little harsh. Nanao: It's okay. I'm the one who should've noticed in the first place. Nanao: In any case, she's no longer an alp. She's been fully reborn as a human. Nanao: It might be strange that she can see some of her memories in her dreams, but she's just a normal human without any special powers now. Shuuji: That's not exactly normal, I'd say. Shuuji: It'd be a lot worse if she was actually like a ghost haunting me or something. Shuuji: Yeah. I feel way better now. Thanks a lot. Nanao: You don't have to thank me. This is all just a theory. I have no proof. You can't even ask the girl in question since she wouldn't be able to answer. Nanao: I'm the one who's sorry. I wasn't able to give you anything concrete. Shuuji: No, you've helped me sort out my own feelings. Shuuji: I really do love that girl. Nanao: ...I see. Nanao: That's something you should be telling her, I think. Shuuji: Yeah, absolutely. Nanao: Sorry, this conversation took longer than I expected. Your coffee must be cold by now. Want me to make you another? Shuuji: Huh? Oh, no, thanks for the offer though. I'm gonna be late if I don't― Shuuji: Oh, shit! I only have two minutes! I'm definitely gonna be late! Sorry, gotta dash! Nanao: Hah, sure thing. Shuuji: I'm really sorry for just barging in on you this morning! Nanao: It's fine. You're welcome back any time. Don't be a stranger. Shuuji: Thanks! Touko: You're welcome, and thank you too. It was great. Shuuji: Yours was even better. Especially the eggs. Touko: I tried making them a little on the sweet side today. I'm glad you liked them. I'll keep making them sweet from now on. Shuuji: That'd be great! Thanks. Touko: I'll have to write this down too. Touko: Oh, you know about this? Shuuji: Yeah, duh. I was there with you yesterday. Touko: Yeah. I'd forget what I want to write about if I left it at home. So why not keep it with me until writing in it becomes a habit? Shuuji: Yeah, it's hard to keep up with things you're not used to. Touko: Oh, speaking of things we're not used to... Shuu-kun, you're really not used to making lunch, are you? Shuuji: Huh? No, I'm not. It was a pain making them just for myself. Shuuji: Wait, does it taste bad?! Touko: Not at all. I loved it. Thank you. Shuuji: No, thank you for your amazing lunches. Touko: Don't mention it! Touko: The taste wasn't the issue... I brought it up because you were late today, right? Shuuji: Oh, well... A bit. Touko: So I thought maybe you were late because you're not used to making lunches and it took you too long... Shuuji: Not at all. Lunch wasn't why I was late. Touko: Then... why were you? Were you feeling a little sick? Shuuji: No, I felt fine... I just overslept. Touko: Oho～ You were doing something dirty late at night, weren't you? Oh my! You naughty boy. Shuuji: H-Haha... Touko: Oh? You're not denying it? H-Huh? Does that mean I hit the bullseye? Touko: Sorry, I only meant that as a joke. Shuuji: No, it's okay. It's just a bit of an awkward subject. Shuuji: Huh? Touko: Were you holding back? Shuuji: Holding back what? Touko: That must've been one intense solo session if you were at it all night. You were backed up, weren't you? Touko: Were you worrying about me and holding back? You can always talk to me, if so. Shuuji: Huh?! Oh, no... That's not... Touko: Really? I would never be grossed out by something like that. In fact... Touko: It's actually... rather interesting. Shuuji: It's... interesting? Touko: It is! I mean... We're still studying, aren't we? And also... back then... Touko: It was my first time, so, honestly... it did hurt. But that started to change near the end. Touko: All my strength left me, I felt all light, and my mind went blank... I can't really explain it. I've never felt anything like that before. Shuuji: Same here. That was the first time I've ever felt that good. Touko: And you came so much that it made me giddy, remember? Touko: If we'd kept going like that... I don't know what would have happened to me. I can't even imagine it. That's why I'm interested. Shuuji: Y-You don't say... Touko: Is that a slutty thing for me to say? Is that... a turn-off? Shuuji: No, not at all. Actually, umm, I'm happy you want to do it again. Relieved, even. Shuuji: I went a bit wild, so I've been pretty worried. Touko: I didn't dislike it, you know? It felt... really good. Touko: I've always heard that the first time hurts a lot, and it did when you first put it in. But before I realized it... it had started to feel good. Touko: Maybe that just shows how compatible we are? Shuuji: Yeah, maybe. I don't think it would've been like that with just anyone. Touko: Yeah, we're special. It felt so good that if it kept on that way, I think I would have orgasmed. Touko: That's part of our love studies too, I think. So... Touko: Will you bring me to climax, Shuu-kun? Shuuji: ...... Touko: Okay, great. Shuuji: ...... Touko: Mm... Touko: Mm, mmm... Mmmph! Shuuji: Mm... Mmpah, mmph... Touko: Mmpwah! Mm, mmph... *kiss* *kiss* Touko: One more... Mm, mmmph, mmpah... Shuuji: H-Hold on a second! We can't go any further. Touko: What? Why not? Shuuji: Did you already forget what we agreed to? We have to be careful not to get carried away at school. Touko: We agreed to that...? I remember no such promise. Shuuji: Don't try and wriggle your way out of this. You did agree to that with me, yes. Touko: Okay... So, are we not allowed dessert either? I thought that much might be okay. Shuuji: Not an intense one like that. Shuuji: ...I'd gladly kiss you all day outside of school, though. Touko: Really? Shuuji: You bet. Touko: Hehe, okay. I'll hold you to that. Touko: Besides, everyone in the club has to use this space. We shouldn't go too far in it. Shuuji: Exactly. Touko: Well... I can't today. I promised to meet someone. I'm sorry. Shuuji: You did? Shuuji: Umm... This person wouldn't happen to be a boy, would it? Touko: ...You curious? Mufu. Shuuji: Well yeah, but... I don't think it matters. I can tell I have nothing to worry about from the way you're talking. Touko: Mm... I'm happy you trust me, but it would've been cuter if you got all flustered. Touko: I am planning on meeting a guy, by the way. An older one. Shuuji: But it's no one I need to be worrying about, is it? Touko: Not really. I have to meet my lawyer today. Shuuji: Your lawyer... The one in charge of your inheritance? Touko: Yeah. He's been really helpful ever since I've started living on my own. Touko: We meet once a month to discuss my financial situation. I even have to keep an accounts book. Touko: So you have nothing to worry about, like you said. By \"older,\" I meant he was over 60 already. Shuuji: I see. Touko: I have to take the day off from our club too, and I'm not sure when I'll be done... I'm sorry that I have to turn you down. Shuuji: Oh, no. You gotta do what you gotta do. Shuuji: That'd be sweet. Oh, I mean... I'd love to. Please, let's. Touko: Okay. Well then... make sure you follow through on that request when the time comes. Shuuji: I-I'll do my best. Shuuji: Hmm... This weekend... Touko: Do you have plans already? Shuuji: No. I'm just wondering what my dad's plans are. Shuuji: He might be a workaholic, but even he takes some weekends off. Shuuji: Huh? Your place? A-Are you sure? Touko: Yeah, of course. I'm always the one coming to yours. Shuuji: Great! I'd love to! Touko: Great. I guess we should sort out our meeting time and place then. Shuuji: Okay! Touko: Let me just lock up... There we go. Touko: What? Shuuji: Your lawyer seems to know a lot about your family. Touko: Unfortunately not. Only enough to know that they wouldn't have left me behind if they could help it. Touko: As soon as he saw me, he could tell I was my mother's daughter. Shuuji: ...Do you look a lot like her or something? Touko: Yeah, like two peas in a pod, he says. In fact, he says we look so similar that he almost thought I was her for a moment. That's why he's so convinced I'm her daughter. Shuuji: You really look that alike? That's pretty unusual. Touko: I know. Children often bear some resemblance to their parents, but it's not often they look exactly the same. Touko: Oh, there's the bell. It's time for us to go back to class, unfortunately. Shuuji: Yeah. Shuuji: Exactly the same as her mother, huh... Nene: It's evening now. Let's stop things here for the day. Meguru: Sounds good. Tsumugi: I'll put away the cups. Meguru: Hey, you two... Wait, Togakushi-senpai took the day off today, didn't she? Shuuji: There's no point in me leaving on my own, so I'll help out. Tsumugi: Thank you. Meguru: Is something wrong with Togakushi-senpai? Nene: She told me that she had plans to meet someone. Meguru: She's meeting someone... Aren't you worried, Senpai? Shuuji: I've heard all about it. She's not doing anything worth worrying about. Meguru: Oh, sounds like you trust her a lot. Tsumugi: That's great. Nene: Well then, let's all clean up together. Shuuji: Let's see... I got the detergent and some salt... Don't think we needed anything else. "

So any ideas? Any place you wanna go, or any things you wanna do?  Nene: Let's see... umm. Shuuji: It can be anything you want.  Shuuji: Ya? Nene: Yakiniku! I want to go to a yakiniku buffet.

They're all things I've been interested in doing, but I could never work up the courage to go alone... Shuuji: Nothing wrong with that. It actually makes me happy that I get to do all these things with you.  Shuuji: Aight, we're gonna do all of 'em! We'll have some yakiniku, go to a karaoke bar, bowl, and take some pictures at a photo booth. Shuuji: Everything you want to do, Nene. Nene: ...Thanks!

What's wrong? Nene: You got a little bit of it on your face.  Shuuji: Where? Shuuji: Okay, thanks. Nene: You're welcome... Alright then, umm, umm... Nene: ...*lick* Shuuji: Nnh―――?! Nene: O-Okay. That was... all of it. Shuuji: Nene, did you just... Shuuji: Yeah, it's all good. Shocked me a bit, but I don't mind. I kind of enjoyed it, actually. Shuuji: So, um... yeah... Nene: ...... Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Hmm... You don't wanna do it again? Nene: Gosh... You'd better not move.  Nene: Mhhhh... *lick* Okay, that's all of it. Shuuji: ...... Nene: Th-That was the last time I'm doing it, though, okay? There are people around us... And it's way too embarrassing.  Nene: I wouldn't mind... But there's a place I'd like to go to. Would you care to come with me? Shuuji: Sure, but where are we going? Nene: Don't worry, it's somewhere close by. We can get there by foot. Shuuji: Okay. Shuuji: Wait... Shuuji: Our school? What are we doing here? Nene: Come on, we're not there yet! Shuuji: Ah, wait up. Nene? Nene: Of course. Some of our sports teams are having competitions fairly soon, so the school is remaining open on weekends for the rest of the year.  Shuuji: Oh, wow. I didn't know that.  Nene: But we might want to make sure nobody sees us. We could get in trouble since we don't have on our uniforms.  Shuuji: Got it. Shuuji: Hmm... I'd say either the locker or on the whiteboard.  Nene: Ah, I was thinking of the locker too. Since we both agree on it, I say we do that. And, perfect.  Nene: Looking at this really makes us seem like a true couple.  Shuuji: Huh? I mean, we've done plenty of things couples do thus far in our relationship... Nene: Yes, I do admit we've been pretty intimate... I know you mentioned it one time, how sometimes we seem more like a husband and wife.  Shuuji: Ah, right. I remember that.  Nene: It goes without saying that I've wholeheartedly enjoyed everything we've done in our relationship thus far... But new things can also be fun. Shuuji: Yeah, I completely agree. Nene: Perfect... I've had so much fun on our date that my mind is out of ideas. I'm completely satisfied.  Shuuji: Me too. I had so much fun with you today it was crazy.  Shuuji: But, the day's not quite over yet.  Nene: ...... Shuuji: You ready? Let's go eat dinner somewhere. Nene: I'd love to, but there's one problem... It seems my time is up. Nene: I would've wanted to eat dinner with you, too... If possible... But I don't think we have enough time left for that.  Shuuji: ...Oh. Nene: I want you to know, I truly had fun on our date. Getting to spend my day with you filled me with so much happiness. Nene: There are countless more things that I would love to do with you... But I won't say that I have regrets. I'm happy.  Nene: ...... Shuuji: Nene? Nene: ...... Nene: After I've gone... There's a chance the hole in your heart may reopen. I have to retrieve them to prevent that from happening. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Alright. Nene: You're not surprised, or anything? Do you really want to go forward with this so readily? Shuuji: I love you more than the world, Nene. And I know that you love me just as much, if not more.  Shuuji: So if this is what you want, then I'll go along with it. It's something I wanted to do, anyways. I don't want to leave you with any regrets. Shuuji: Come on, Nene, don't frown like that. Give me that beautiful smile that I know and love you for. Nene: I've... really changed. Before I met you, all I could think about was my contract... There very well could've been a hole in my own heart, just like yours.  Nene: But I was able to change myself for the better.  Shuuji: So was I. Meeting you made such a difference for me, Nene.  Nene: I love the person I've become since then. Returning to my previous self... It's a very sad thought to me now.  Shuuji: It's the exact same for me. Before summer break, I wasn't even capable of smiling from the bottom of my heart. I know how important and precious it is to smile now, thanks to you.  Nene: I want to protect you, Shuuji-kun. Because of the gratitude I feel towards you. Of course, I know I have no right to say that when I'm about to cause you so much pain.  Nene: It's selfish of me to force my own wishes on you, like I have some authority over you. I know I should feel ashamed of that.  Nene: But still, I want to see you smile. I want you to be happy even after I leave.  Nene: ...I'm so, so sorry for doing this. But I... want you to know... Nene: I truly love you from the bottom of my heart. Shuuji: I truly love you from the bottom of my heart too, Nene. Shuuji: You promised me you'd be smiling when you left.  Nene: ...... Shuuji: If you cried during our final moment together I'm sure you'd end up regretting it.  Shuuji: And just a minute or two ago, you said you didn't want any regrets. You'd ruin it all by doing something like that now.  Nene: This really is it... Shuuji: ...I guess so. Shuuji: That's enough.  Shuuji: I already know how you feel. And likewise, you know how I feel. Shuuji: So if you want to give me anything, give me a smile, Nene. And I'll give you one too, to wish you luck on your journey.  Nene: ...... Nene: Thank you. I'll find happiness, I promise. And furthermore, I'll find you, and we'll be happy together.  Shuuji: I know you can do it.  Nene: It will happen. You have my word on it.  Shuuji: Okay. Nene: It may take a bit of time... But I swear to you that I'll find you and make you happy. We'll both smile again, together, from the bottom of our hearts. Shuuji: Ah――! Nene: ...See you soon. "

            "Kanae: Huh? You're joining a club? Kanae: Well, yeah. You've never been one to care about making friends with your classmates.  Kanae: And now you're suddenly joining a club... Oh, don't get the wrong idea, though; Personally I'm all in favor of you joining a club. Kanae: Socializing with your peers is a staple part of school, and see, you've been on my mind for a while now.  Kanae: But why the OC of all the clubs out there? Shuuji: Well, things happened. Shuuji: Plus Ayachi-san's the only member, so I wouldn't have to worry about cliques or anything like that.  Kanae: Uh-huh. Did you get Ayachi's permission? Shuuji: Yeah, of course. Kanae: ...Well, if she's alright with it, I've got nothing to say.  Kanae: Here's your admission form. Just fill it out and hand it to Ayachi. Shuuji: Thanks. Kanae: Just curious, Hoshina, but have you always known Ayachi-san? I don't remember you two ever being in class together, and I've never seen you with her around school.  Shuuji: Well, some stuff happened... We're friends now, though.  Kanae: Still, talk about out of left field... Not only you joining the club, but Ayachi-san letting you.  Shuuji: So a lot of people still want to join her club over here, then? Kanae: Over here? Over where? Shuuji: Ah, forget that. But, right, back to what I was saying: Do a lot of people try to join? Kanae: Oh, you bet. The only member's the envy of the whole school. There'd be something up if people WEREN'T wanting to join. Kanae: Hmm... Hard to answer... I'm not her homeroom teacher, you gotta remember.  Shuuji: But you're the club advisor, right? Kanae: Yeah, but that's pretty much just on paper... The OC doesn't require much work for me, as the advisor. Kanae: Anyway, this is just based on how I see her around school... But I get this impression that she's overloaded. Kanae: Kind of like a rubber band, so pulled back you're just waiting for it to snap. I'd be lying if I said I'm not concerned about how strung-up she appears. Kanae: Since you're joining, I'm guessing you know what the club does? Shuuji: Yeah. Listening to student's problems, reading tarot fortunes for them, and then helping with the problem in whatever way we can.  Kanae: Right. But she's doing that all by herself. I'm sure you know how people sometimes get with their hobbies... Take it lightly, end up slacking on occasion, and so on. Kanae: That girl, though, she never skimps. Never compromises. And despite how much effort she pours into her club, her grades remain at the top of the pack.  Shuuji: ...... Kanae: Then there's also the fact that she treats everyone the same. You'll never hear any arguments or bickering from her class.  Shuuji: What's bad about that?  Kanae: It's not bad, per se, but it's just not normal.  Kanae: Remember, we're talking 30 young men and women, all cooped up in a small room for an extended period of time. Not everyone's gonna get along perfectly. But with Ayachi, she mediates and stops every potential dispute. Kanae: Of course you have students that'll naturally end up in that role, but what's worrying me with Ayachi is that she comes off way too serious about it.  Shuuji: ...Huh.  Kanae: Pretty much the opposite with you, though. I'm worried about how uninterested you are in your classmates.   Kanae: Boy, all my problems would be solved if I could just find a way to mix you two together.  Shuuji: Sorry for the trouble. Kanae: Well, it's what I signed up for when I became a teacher. But if you have the time to be apologizing to me, go out there and socialize some.  Shuuji: ...I'll do what I can. Kanae: Honestly, I'm more worried about you than Ayachi.  Shuuji: Huh? Am I that bad at socializing? Kanae: Absolutely. I'm only a tad bit worried for Ayachi. But with you, mister, it's full-on concern. I can already envision the sad life you'll have after graduation if you don't change.  Kanae: So like I said, joining a club is a step in the right direction, no matter the reason. Kanae: Still... Just how the heck did you get Ayachi to let you join? Shuuji: I don't know, I must just be that sexy and irresistible.  Kanae: BHYAHYAHYAHYA!! Hoshina, you'd make a good comedian! Nearly spit out me coffee after hearing that one ROFL. Kanae: Holy cow, that was golden. Talk about a hilarious joke. Never seen sarcasm that on-point. I mean, who would be willing to roast themselves that hard for a joke?  Kanae: Haah, haah... Phew, you're a hoot. I'll be rootin' for ya, so keep it up, mister Sexy Man Hoshina. LOL. Shuuji: Glad to see you still cackle just like a witch. You know, if you keep talking like some internet memester from the 2000s, you're never going to find a― Kanae: Huh? You say something, punk? Shuuji: Nooope. Nothing at all. Kanae: Have a good rest of the day.  Shuuji: ...... Kanae: \"Of course you have students that'll naturally end up in that role, but what's worrying me with Ayachi is that she comes off way too serious about it.\" "

Well, I guess being sick isn't a good thing.  Shuuji: How are you holding up? Have a fever? Any coughing? Nene: \"I have a slight fever... But don't worry, it's nothing serious.\" Shuuji: Then what's the problem?  Nene: \"Well, err... yeah...\" Shuuji: Have you seen a doctor?  Nene: \"Oh no, I don't think I've actually been afflicted with anything... I just woke up feeling a little unwell this morning... So I've been in my bed resting all day.\" Shuuji: Man, that doesn't sound too good... Nene: \"Well... To be honest, I wasn't feeling too great when I went to bed last night.\" Shuuji: I think I know what's the culprit... Shuuji: You just ate too much yesterday.  Nene: \"......\" Nene: \"D-Don't say that to me... I'm already embarrassed enough as it is!\" Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: ...Pfft! Shuuji: Ahahahahahahahahahaha!! Nene: \"D-Don't laugh at me! You're so mean! I just told you I was embarrassed!\" Shuuji: Ah, sorry, I couldn't help myself. Nene: \"Nngh.\" Shuuji: Are you... mad at me? Nene: \"Absolutely. Me mad. Me big mad.\" Shuuji: I'm really sorry. Nene: \"Well... you do have a point...\" Nene: \"But I'd be too embarrassed to go see someone about this... How do I explain to them that I ate too much?\" Shuuji: I understand, but still... Nene: \"Oh, and anyways, I'm feeling a lot better now than I was this morning. I'm confident I'll feel fine in no time if I just rest up.\" Shuuji: Well, if you say so, I'll believe you. Shuuji: But anyways, I was wondering if I could, umm... maybe come visit you? Nene: \"Huh? Right now?\" Shuuji: I'm a little worried so I wanted to come check on you. Nene: \"I appreciate the sentiment... but this is a bit too sudden for me.\" Shuuji: Well, I'm not trying to stay over there or anything. I was just thinking maybe since you've been stuck in bed, there might be things you need but can't go out and get.  Shuuji: So, if you need drinks or food or whatever, I could go get stuff and bring it to you. It'd serve as a nice quick check-up, plus an apology for laughing at you earlier.  Shuuji: It'll take a while if you want me to go get anything, just as a forewarning. So, do you want me to...? Nene: \"......\" Shuuji: I'm not trying to come across as pushy or anything, so if you don't want me over right now you can just say so.  Shuuji: Any specific kind? Nene: \"Just pick any they sell at convenience stores.\" Shuuji: Just that? You sure you don't want anything to eat? Nene: \"I do... but I'm still feeling a bit nauseous.\" Shuuji: Okay. Then give me about, hrm... 20 minutes, and I'll be over there. Is that okay? Nene: \"Sure.\" Nene: \"I'm sorry for making you do this.\" Shuuji: It's no big deal. I mean, hey, I'm an OC member. When someone needs help, it's my job to help.  Nene: \"...Thank you.\" Shuuji: Alright, see you in 20 minutes. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Pheeew, god damn that was nerve-wracking... Shuuji: Alright, then! Gotta hurry so I make it back in time for afternoon classes.  Nene: Hoshina-kun's coming... Nene: O-Oh goodness! I have to clean! Ah, and I need to change clothes too! Nene: Uhh... I-I feel awful... But I have to get up and move... Clerk: Have a good day! Shuuji: Okaaay, so... Shuuji: Umm, it's me, Hoshina. I'm here.  Nene: \"Come on in.\" Shuuji: Oh, no, I was just gonna drop off the stuff and leave. I don't wanna stay and intrude on you.  Nene: I can't have you leave after all the trouble I made you go through; that would be rude. Go ahead, come in and make yourself at home.  Shuuji: O-Okay... if you say so.  Nene: Missing only a single day is nothing worth concern. And I properly notified the school too.  Shuuji: Well, it's because you're living by yourself. Having no one else to help can be a little concerning in situations like these.  Shuuji: Hisashima-sensei was planning to come check on you if I hadn't. Nene: She was? Really, there's no need to be concerned... I promise I'm fine.  Shuuji: You may be fine, but you're still sick. Your face looks a little bit pale too. Shuuji: Oh, and I guess I should apologize. I didn't want to make this into some big visit, but here you went and got ready for me and everything.  Nene: Well, I wouldn't put it like that... It's just the normal thing to do. Welcoming you in my pajamas would be rude. Shuuji: I don't really think that matters when you're sick... Shuuji: But anyway, you're going to make me feel bad, so lie back down and rest. You're still not completely recovered, right?  Nene: Oh, I'll be fine. Just a little bit of moving around isn't going to hurt me.  Nene: Thank you. Shuuji: I also got you some foods that're easy to digest. If you want to try eating feel free to help yourself.  Nene: ...... Nene: *giggle* Shuuji: Err, um... What is it? Nene: I was just thinking about how you're being so overly caring. It almost feels like you're my mother. Shuuji: Oh, sorry. Was I being kind of annoying?  Nene: No, not at all. I'm thankful that you went out of your way to come visit me.  Shuuji: Really?  Nene: Of course. If I had no desire to see you I would've just said no when you initially asked.  Nene: You can tell that I'm not lying, can't you?  Shuuji: Mhm, I guess, yeah. Nene: So, consequently, well... I'm at a bit of a loss for what to do. I have so few experiences with these situations.  Shuuji: Since you said this doesn't happen a lot, I'm going to give you the full \"being nursed\" experience. Shuuji: But just a fair warning, I'm not used to this kinda thing either. Nene: Oh no, I couldn't have you do that when you've already gone out and bought things for me. I'd feel bad making you do all that... Shuuji: C'mon, you're sick right now so you need to be in bed. Oh, and did you say you were hungry? I'll make some udon, if that's fine by you.  Nene: Huh? You don't have to do that... Besides, if you stay here too long you'll be late for afternoon classes.  Shuuji: Don't worry, I'm aware. It's a bit unfortunate, but I'll only be able to do a few quick things. I don't plan on skipping class. Nene: But... Shuuji: Please, just let me do this. I have to.  Nene: Why is that?  Shuuji: Well... Shuuji: The thing is, right... Shuuji: See... You being absent from school is pretty rare in and of itself, so it got me thinking about things.  Nene: Now that you mention it... This might be the first time I've missed a day of school at Himematsu. Shuuji: And hey, it's not like we're strangers or anything. Friends worry about each other. Shuuji: I just couldn't get my mind off you all class. It was so bad I didn't hear a single thing during class, because I was so busy asking myself if you were okay, if you might need help, and so on.  Shuuji: I guess it doesn't help that you've been on my mind a whole lot recently with things. Heck, I even see you in my dreams― Nene: You're dreaming of me...? Shuuji: ...Huh? Ah, crap...! Shuuji: NO!! They're completely normal dreams, I swear! Nene: R-Really...? Shuuji: Cross my heart hope to die. Geez... What kind of stuff were you imagining me dreaming about...? Nene: Well, you know, the kind of dreams that make you, well, you know... I believe they're called wet dreams. Nene: ...How could you make me say w-w-wet dreams?! Shuuji: How is that my fault?! Shuuji: Look, as I explained, I didn't have any \"wet dreams\" about you. They were wholly innocent.  Nene: But... If there wasn't anything sexual involved... What kind of things did I do in your dreams? Shuuji: Well, umm... Nene: Y-Yes? Shuuji: My point is, I need to do this so I can get peace of mind. So could you please let me use your kitchen, plus some vegetables if you have any? Nene: Sure, that's fine by me... Ah, wait, that's not we were talking about―  Shuuji: You're sick right now so you need to be in bed! C'mon, off you go! Nene: Ah, wait, Hoshina-kun. Nene: \"Sure, go ahead.\" Shuuji: I see you're staying in bed like a good girl. Nene: ...I'd appreciate it if you didn't treat me like a small child. Shuuji: Well, I don't know if you can call yourself a big girl after upsetting your stomach like you did yesterday.  Nene: ...... Nene: You're such a meanie. I mean it.  Shuuji: Eh, I'm not really trying to tease you or anything.  Shuuji: Oh, here's some applesauce. Should be light enough for you to eat. Just make sure to finish it before it turns brown. Nene: Thank you... Shuuji: And I also made you some apple kudzu starch gruel. This'll warm you up. Shuuji: The udon's currently cooking, so give me a few more minutes for that. I'll have it nice and soft.  Nene: Oh, okay.  Shuuji: Oh, and don't force yourself to eat any of this if you don't want to. You can just tell me if you don't want it.  Nene: No, that's fine. I'm hungry, so I'll eat everything.  Shuuji: Okay, that's good.  Nene: But I have to say, you seem like you're used to doing these things. Shuuji: Really? It's actually my first time nursing someone though. My dad has way too much energy to ever fall sick. But hmm, I do do a lot of the housework... so maybe it's that. Nene: Then in that case, maybe it isn't your own experience, but the experiences you've had of your own family looking after you when you were sick?  Shuuji: Hmm... That has happened a few times, but I don't think I'm mimicking what they did.  Taichi: How do you feel, son? A little tired? They say the best way to get rid of a cold is to give it someone else, so go ahead and give it to me.  Taichi: Your dad's thinking the best way to go about that would be a smooch; what do ya say? Wanna give your old man a kiss?  Taichi: *smooooch*! Shuuji: Oh my GOOOD, can you just go away!! I'm trying to sleep here!! "

            "Wakana: Ah! Yeah, it's going great! That place you introduced me to is awesome! Thanks so much! Nene: Oh, I didn't do anything special. I'm just glad that I was able to help. Please don't hesitate to stop by the clubroom again should something else come up. Wakana: Thanks! But I'll be fine. It's just working and earning the money from here on out, after all! Hideaki: ...Umm, may I ask a question? Wakana: Hm? What do you want? Hideaki: What're y'all talking about? And whose clubroom? Wakana: Oh... About that, umm... Do you want me to tell them, Ayachi-san? Nene: I don't mind. As long as you don't thoughtlessly spread it around, you can tell a few people. Hideaki: What's this? Some kind of secret? Nene: Nothing that important. She's talking about me being in the OC.  Shuuji: OC... You mean the Occult Club? Hideaki: Never knew we had a club like that at this school.  Nene: It has been around since before we were here, actually. Though, unfortunately, I'm the only current member.  Hideaki: So with this occult stuff... Are you researching ghosts, or like aliens, or something? Nene: No, I'm doing divination. \"Occult\" encompasses the entire spectrum of the supernatural. Wakana: And she also offers counseling as a bit of a side thing.  Shuuji: So I guess you went and asked for her help on something? Wakana: Yup. Hideaki: Huh. Didn't think someone like you actually worried about things.  Wakana: ...You're the last person I want to hear that from. Wakana: But yeah, it's nothing big really. I just don't have the money to buy something I want. Wakana: And when I went to her for help, she got me this great part-time job.  Nene: You're saving up for a guitar, right? Shuuji: Oh, you can play the guitar? Wakana: I can, actually. Though, I'm not really a pro or anything. Wakana: I found my dad's old guitar a while back, and he's been teaching me ever since. Apparently, he used to be in a band. Wakana: I've been going at it for a few years now, so I've been wanting to get my own, but the one I'm looking at's pretty darn expensive.  Shuuji: And that's why you went to Ayachi-san. I see.  Wakana: Basically, yep.  Hideaki: So you play the guitar, eh? Boy, that sure takes me back. Wakana: Can you play guitar too? Hideaki: If it's just simple chords and crap, yeah. I didn't play the guitar for very long. Nene: Right. You prefer the drums.  Hideaki: ...Huh? Wakana: You play the drums, Kaidou? Shuuji: Seriously? Hideaki: Y-Yeah... I played the drums seriously till about a year ago, during summer. How'd you know that, Ayachi-san? Nene: Ah...! Well, umm... Hideaki: Did you see one of our performances at a club? Wait, no, that can't be it. I definitely would've remembered seeing a pretty girl like you there.  Hideaki: There really weren't a lot of people there... What was it, then? Nene: Well, umm... er, that's... because... m-m-m-m-my divination. I learned that through divination. Hideaki: For frickin' real?! Dang, that stuff is crazy! I always thought it was kinda bogus, to be honest... Never thought you could legit figure out stuff like that.  Wakana: She has a pretty high accuracy rating, or so the girls say.  Shuuji: ...Oh, really? That's neat.  Nene: Umm, if you want to, Hoshina-kun... I could do one for you. Would that be something you're interested in? Wakana, Hideaki: ...... Shuuji: You mean... an actual prediction? Nene: Yes. So, do you want to? Is there maybe something that's been bothering you ever since you were a small child? Shuuji: Nnh―――! Nene: With things like those, it always feels better to talk about it with another person, so if you feel up to it, you're welcome to stop by the clubroom at any time.  Shuuji: ...... Nene: Nothing in particular. I was only proposing a common scenario. There wasn't any deeper meaning to it. Shuuji: Okay, then... Wakana: Did you see something with your divination about him? Nene: You could say so. Nene's Classmate B: Ayachi-saaan! I was gonna ask you something about our math class later on today; could you help me? It's my turn to get called on today. Nene: Ah, sure. Of course. Nene's Classmate B: You're the best! Thanks so much! Nene: Alright then. I'll see you three later.  Wakana: Yeah, bye. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: What can I say... Hideaki: Just make up a problem if you don't got one, sheesh. Just go for the divination so you can spend time alone with her. Man, I can't believe you.  Shuuji: She's helping people out of the kindness of her heart. It just feels wrong to go there with ulterior motives.  Wakana: It's funny you say that, Kaidou, because I didn't see her inviting you. She probably realized how much of a sleazeball you are.  Hideaki: ...Kinda hurts when you say that so bluntly, you know. Shuuji: Ngh―――! Wakana: Hoshina? What're you making that face for? Everything alright?  Shuuji: Ah, yeah. It's nothing.  Hideaki: Yeah, we better.  Wakana: Oh right, there's something I need you guys to do for me. It's about Ayachi-san's club she mentioned.  Shuuji: Ah, didn't she mention she didn't want us spreading it around thoughtlessly? Wakana: Yeah, that's what I was gonna say. Wakana: She's the only one in there, so if word gets out to the whole school, she'll end up swarmed by guys with ulterior motives.   Shuuji: Oh, so guys like Kaidou. Gotcha.  Hideaki: ...Well, I won't deny it. Wakana: So, like I was saying, it'd be a real problem for Ayachi-san if animals like that start barging in her clubroom. Wakana: Plus, like, it'd scare off girls actually wanting to go there for advice, right? So try to keep it to yourself as much as possible.  Hideaki: Sure thing. I won't tell a soul. Hideaki: Means I got an edge over those other guys anyways! Hideaki: Okay, got it. Shuuji: I'll keep my mouth shut too. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: It's no big deal. Girl: Thank you so much. Alright then, good luck♪ Shuuji: See you later.  Hideaki: So you still got roped into doing this, eh? Shuuji: I already said yes, so I can't just change my answer on her now.  Hideaki: Well... I guess that's fair enough. Shuuji: Besides, it's all simple stuff. Don't worry about it.  Hideaki: ...If you say so. But if you ever need me to do something, just hit me up. Wakana: Hoshina, are you sure you don't want any help? Hideaki: Hmm. I guess I can help too, if you want.  Shuuji: I appreciate it, you guys, but I'll really be fine.  Shuuji: You probably have better things to do with your time, anyways.  Wakana: ...Knew you'd say that. Hideaki: You never wanna take help when you get yourself into these situations.  Shuuji: D-Do I? I don't purposely try to... Besides, isn't it only natural for me to not want my friends taking time out of their schedule to help me do something I agreed to? Shuuji: All I'm honestly doing today is entering some data into their database. It's better that I do it alone, if anything.  Shuuji: But, if something like this does happen again, I will come to you guys. Hideaki: You should try not to get into these situations in the first place.  Shuuji: Ah, right. I'll keep that in mind.  Wakana: I'm sure you will. And next time a girl comes up to with something, you'll be too chicken to say no, and then we'll go through this whole thing again. Shuuji: Well, not that I have any problem to come to her with... Shuuji: I've been told to come here and register some new books into the library catalog. Shuuji: Sure.  Committee Girl: Huh? Shuuji: I doubt anyone is gonna come by this late anyway, and I can return the key to the faculty room myself once I'm done. Committee Girl: But... I'm on duty and you aren't even a Committee member... Shuuji: I'm a Library Committee substitute today. It'll be alright. Probably. Committee Girl: You think so? Committee Girl: ...I guess you're right. Okay, here's the key. I'll finish everything else, so just make sure you lock the library once you're done.  Shuuji: Will do. Committee Girl: Could you also turn off the computer before you leave? Shuuji: Oh yeah, of course. I won't forget. Take care on your way home.  Committee Girl: Yeah, thanks! You too. Bye. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Mhh... Now I feel a little bit better. Shuuji: ...That was cringe.  Wakana: \"Hoshina, are you sure you don't want any help?\" Hideaki: \"Hmm. I guess I can help too, if you want. \" Shuuji: They were kind enough to offer... Why didn't I take it? Shuuji: ...If I keep this up, I wouldn't blame them for not wanting to be my friend anymore.  Shuuji: Wait, I can't just bank on something like that happening. I need to put in effort myself. Shuuji: I really need to fundamentally change who I am.  Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: I think I'll come back here on another date. Checking out what kinds of books they have here could be a good way to kill some time.  Nene: I thought this was the right day... Nene: You said you'd fall in love with me... You promised me all I had to do was find you... So why is none of this working out?! Shuuji: Mh... Fuah, aaaaah... Shuuji: Morning. Hideaki: Oh, hey there.  Hideaki: How'd it go yesterday? Shuuji: Pretty swimmingly. I was done with everything before sunset. Akita: Good morning, Hoshina-kun! Shuuji: Oh yeah, hey, Akita-san. Akita: Really sorry about yesterday. I mean, having you fill in for me on such short notice. How'd it go? Shuuji: Great. Finished everything without a hitch, so you're all set. Akita: Wow, really?! Thanks so much! You're the best. Shuuji: Did everything go alright at your thing yesterday? Akita: Yep, you bet! Akita: Ah, right! I baked some cookies as thanks. Here you go! I baked them myself, too! Shuuji: Oh, thanks.  Hideaki: Listen, Akita. I know Shuuji's partly to blame for being such a sucker, but you gotta do these things yourself.  Akita: I know, I know. I apologized to him for it.  Akita: But yesterday really was an important, special day! It was super rare! Like hospital rare! Shuuji: \"Hospital rare\"? Is that your way of saying there was a physician at the mixer? That's pretty impressive. Akita: Ah... Akita: Mixer? What's that? I have no idea what you mean, eheh! Anyway, thanks a lot for yesterday☆ Shuuji: Guess that hospital whatever mixer went great for her.  Hideaki: You could've given her more shit for it, in my opinion... But I didn't like that sarcastic comment you threw in.  Shuuji: I can at least do that. I just hope it teaches her a lesson... But hey, I got some cookies out of it this time, so it's all good. Hideaki: Isn't that just her blatantly showing off, like \"I'm such an amazing, domestic girl☆\"? Shuuji: Doesn't change how happy I was. Hideaki: I can relate. You know they're playing you, but you just can't help but feel glad. Wakana: Morning! Shuuji: Ah, morning. Hideaki: Hey, Wakana-chan. Wakana: What are you guys talking about? Shuuji: The simple-minded nature of men. Wakana: What? Oh, don't tell me... You were talking about naughty topics you don't want a girl to hear about? Hideaki: We guys have our own secrets too. But it wasn't anything sex-related.  Wakana: I don't buy it. Wakana: Hm? What's up? Schoolgirl D: You got someone here to see you! Wakana: Who? Nene: ...... Nene: I need to talk with you about something... Do you have a moment? Wakana: Sure, but what's up? Is it about my part-time job? Nene: No, it's entirely unrelated to that to that... I have a favor I want to ask of you. Wakana: Sure... If it's something I can help you with... Nene: Okay then, umm... Come with me. Wakana: Huh? But the bell's about to― Nene: I promise it won't take long at all.  Shuuji: No idea. Maybe some girls only conversation? Hideaki: Man... That gets me kinda excited. Think it's about a crush? Shuuji: I don't think they're THAT good of friends... Shuuji: Who knows.  Hideaki: What'd she want?  Wakana: Oh, yeah. She just wanted me to relay a message to someone.  Hideaki: Huh? Why would she go to you for that? Wakana: Sorry, I promised not to tell anyone about it. I also can't tell you who the person is.  Hideaki: ...You're just getting me more curious.  Wakana: Oh, look, there's the bell. That means we're done talking here.  Hideaki: Well, shucks. Wakana: Here. For you.  Shuuji: What's this... An envelope? Is there a letter inside? "

Shuuji: You want me to carve some pumpkins and make jack-o'-lanterns? Nene: Yes. I'd appreciate it. Tsumugi: What about us? It might be tough for Hoshina-kun to handle that by himself. Should we help? Nene: No, carving pumpkins is tough physical work, so the boys from the Student Council will be helping with that. Meguru: Should we handle the decorations then? Nene: Yes. Togakushi-senpai and Koshiji-san are out making purchases right now. We'll start decorating the gym once they come back. Tsumugi: And in the afternoon we'll make the cookies and pudding? Nene: Yes. That's the plan. Meguru: Alright! We're in the home stretch! Let's get to it! Student Council Member A: Oh, thanks. Shuuji: Just one more jack-o'-lantern left per person. Anyway, here are some more pumpkin guts. Touko: Thank you. Shuuji: How are things going on your side? Touko: It's quite strenuous. Shuuji: Do you need more people? Touko: Nah. There are just a lot of batches we have to make. Throwing more people at the problem won't help. Touko: You know, Inaba-san is actually pretty good at cooking. She's really impressive. She's quick and her food tastes great. The guests are gonna love it. Shuuji: That sounds great. I'm expecting some great snacks from her now. Touko: Oh right. Speaking of expectations, how are things looking on your end? For your band, I mean. Shuuji: Ugh. Touko: Hm? Is something wrong? Shuuji: Yeah. The pressure is starting to get to me... Touko: You're a boy, so stop talking like a wimp. I'm expecting you to look cool up there on stage! Mufufu. Shuuji: You're just adding on even more pressure. Please stop. Touko: If just my expectations are putting that much pressure on you, how are you gonna play in front of a crowd? Man up. Shuuji: I get your point, but... I never go to events like these in the first place. Shuuji: But now I suddenly have to perform on stage? My heart is pounding like crazy. Shuuji: You don't get nervous when appearing before a crowd? Touko: Hmm... I just got used to it after a while. Touko: Oh, I know! How about this? Give yourself a reward if your performance is a success. Shuuji: Reward myself? Touko: Yup, that's right. Something like treating yourself to a fancy meal, for example. Touko: After all, motivation is important. Touko: Oh, I said \"motivation,\" okay? Not \"masturbation.\" A bad pun like that would be really unnecessary. Shuuji: You're right. It WAS totally unnecessary! Shuuji: It was fine advice. I just can't think of anything that would motivate me. Touko: Oh. Well, I'm sure it's hard to think of something on the spot. Touko: Alrighty! New plan. If you kick butt up there on stage, I'll personally give you a reward. Shuuji: You? To me? Touko: Did that maybe get you a little too motivated? Mufufu. Shuuji: I don't know if \"motivated\" is the right word... Touko: I just hope you aren't expecting anything too much, or anything sexual. Anyway, do your best up there! Touko: Alright, I should get back to work. You keep it up as well. Meguru: Tadaaa! What do you think? Meguru: Rawr! I'm gonna eat you up! Just kidding! Shuuji: Ooh, that looks great on you. Meguru: You think? I'm a little embarrassed... Ehehe. Shuuji: Not just the looks. It really fits your cheerful personality. Meguru: Thank you. Your costume looks good on you too. Shuuji: Oh, I dunno about that. There's nothing special about it. Shuuji: I guess. Meguru: Nene-senpai, you look great in your costume too. Nene: Thank you. Though, I'm not used to wearing this kind of outfit, so I'm a little nervous. Shuuji: Yeah? Shuuji: Er, it's nothing. I wasn't thinking anything weird at all.  Nene: Are you sure? Nene: Because I was pretty sure you were thinking \"you wear even more revealing clothes all the time.\" Shuuji: ...Ugh, the look you're giving me hurts. Please stop. Nene: I know... Don't remind me about how I have to dress in such a ridiculous and embarrassing outfit... Shuuji: Well, you look great in your current costume, at least. You shouldn't feel embarrassed by that. Shuuji: What's it supposed to be, though? Nene: I don't think it's supposed to be anything in particular. I think it's just a normal gothic dress. Gothic outfits are normal for Halloween. Shuuji: Yeah? That's new to me. Good to know. Nene: But... Does it really look okay? It doesn't look strange on me? Like... I didn't put it on the wrong way? It doesn't look awful on me? Shuuji: I don't think you have anything to worry about. You look great. Shuuji: I'm positive you'll draw a lot of attention in that, in a good way. You almost look too good in it. So don't worry.

Shuuji: Thanks, Nene. Shuuji: Dang, this is good! I just knew the ice cream cone you made me would be extra good. Nene: Thank you for the compliment. But I think the taste of the ice cream is the same no matter who makes it. Shuuji: That's how it should be, yeah. Which is why it's all the more a mystery that mine tastes so good.  Shuuji: Hm? What's wrong? Nene: You got a little bit of it on your face.  Shuuji: Where? Shuuji: Okay, thanks. Nene: You're welcome... Alright then, umm, umm... Nene: ...*lick* Shuuji: Nnh―――?! Nene: O-Okay. That was... all of it. Shuuji: Nene, did you just... Shuuji: Yeah, it's all good. Shocked me a bit, but I don't mind. I kind of enjoyed it, actually. Shuuji: So, um... yeah... Nene: ...... Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Hmm... You don't wanna do it again? Nene: Gosh... You'd better not move.  Nene: Mhhhh... *lick* Okay, that's all of it. Shuuji: ...... Nene: Th-That was the last time I'm doing it, though, okay? There are people around us... And it's way too embarrassing.  Nene: I wouldn't mind... But there's a place I'd like to go to. Would you care to come with me? Shuuji: Sure, but where are we going? Nene: Don't worry, it's somewhere close by. We can get there by foot. Shuuji: Okay. Shuuji: Wait... Shuuji: Our school? What are we doing here? Nene: Come on, we're not there yet! Shuuji: Ah, wait up. Nene? Nene: Of course. Some of our sports teams are having competitions fairly soon, so the school is remaining open on weekends for the rest of the year.  Shuuji: Oh, wow. I didn't know that.  Nene: But we might want to make sure nobody sees us. We could get in trouble since we don't have on our uniforms.  Shuuji: Got it. Shuuji: Hmm... I'd say either the locker or on the whiteboard.  Nene: Ah, I was thinking of the locker too. Since we both agree on it, I say we do that. And, perfect.  Nene: Looking at this really makes us seem like a true couple.  Shuuji: Huh? I mean, we've done plenty of things couples do thus far in our relationship... Nene: Yes, I do admit we've been pretty intimate... I know you mentioned it one time, how sometimes we seem more like a husband and wife.  Shuuji: Ah, right. I remember that.  Nene: It goes without saying that I've wholeheartedly enjoyed everything we've done in our relationship thus far... But new things can also be fun. Shuuji: Yeah, I completely agree. Nene: Perfect... I've had so much fun on our date that my mind is out of ideas. I'm completely satisfied.  Shuuji: Me too. I had so much fun with you today it was crazy.  Shuuji: But, the day's not quite over yet.  Nene: ...... Shuuji: You ready? Let's go eat dinner somewhere. Nene: I'd love to, but there's one problem... It seems my time is up. Nene: I would've wanted to eat dinner with you, too... If possible... But I don't think we have enough time left for that.  Shuuji: ...Oh. Nene: I want you to know, I truly had fun on our date. Getting to spend my day with you filled me with so much happiness. Nene: There are countless more things that I would love to do with you... But I won't say that I have regrets. I'm happy.  Nene: ...... Shuuji: Nene? Nene: ...... Nene: After I've gone... There's a chance the hole in your heart may reopen. I have to retrieve them to prevent that from happening. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Alright. Nene: You're not surprised, or anything? Do you really want to go forward with this so readily? Shuuji: I love you more than the world, Nene. And I know that you love me just as much, if not more.  Shuuji: So if this is what you want, then I'll go along with it. It's something I wanted to do, anyways. I don't want to leave you with any regrets. Shuuji: Come on, Nene, don't frown like that. Give me that beautiful smile that I know and love you for. Nene: I've... really changed. Before I met you, all I could think about was my contract... There very well could've been a hole in my own heart, just like yours.  Nene: But I was able to change myself for the better.  Shuuji: So was I. Meeting you made such a difference for me, Nene.  Nene: I love the person I've become since then. Returning to my previous self... It's a very sad thought to me now.  Shuuji: It's the exact same for me. Before summer break, I wasn't even capable of smiling from the bottom of my heart. I know how important and precious it is to smile now, thanks to you.  Nene: I want to protect you, Shuuji-kun. Because of the gratitude I feel towards you. Of course, I know I have no right to say that when I'm about to cause you so much pain.  Nene: It's selfish of me to force my own wishes on you, like I have some authority over you. I know I should feel ashamed of that.  Nene: But still, I want to see you smile. I want you to be happy even after I leave.  Nene: ...I'm so, so sorry for doing this. But I... want you to know... Nene: I truly love you from the bottom of my heart. Shuuji: I truly love you from the bottom of my heart too, Nene. Shuuji: You promised me you'd be smiling when you left.  Nene: ...... Shuuji: If you cried during our final moment together I'm sure you'd end up regretting it.  Shuuji: And just a minute or two ago, you said you didn't want any regrets. You'd ruin it all by doing something like that now.  Nene: This really is it... Shuuji: ...I guess so. Shuuji: That's enough.  Shuuji: I already know how you feel. And likewise, you know how I feel. Shuuji: So if you want to give me anything, give me a smile, Nene. And I'll give you one too, to wish you luck on your journey.  Nene: ...... Nene: Thank you. I'll find happiness, I promise. And furthermore, I'll find you, and we'll be happy together.  Shuuji: I know you can do it.  Nene: It will happen. You have my word on it.  Shuuji: Okay. Nene: It may take a bit of time... But I swear to you that I'll find you and make you happy. We'll both smile again, together, from the bottom of our hearts. Shuuji: Ah――! Nene: ...See you soon. "

            "Guy: What's up? You took on someone else's work again, didn't you? Shuuji: For a Library Committee member, yeah. Apparently, there's something important going on today she can't put off. Guy: Library Committee? Oh... You mean Akita? Guy: She's probably just playing you. There's a reason people call her the \"mixer queen.\" That thing she can't put off is 100\\% just another mixer. She was even talking about the details in the classroom. Shuuji: Oh, a mixer... I see. I suppose that does involve her future, in a way. Guy: Don't tell me you already knew? Shuuji: Kind of. I didn't know what exactly she was doing, but I did have the feeling it wasn't as important as she made it sound. Shuuji: Well, I could have, but... I just figured that I may as well do it if she already has other plans. Guy: Shuuji... Seriously... Hideaki: Want me to tell them no for you? Shuuji: Don't bother. I appreciate the offer, but I'm not a little child; I'm perfectly capable of saying no when I really don't want to do something. Hideaki: ...And yet I've never seen you do so. Shuuji: Well, I don't have much to do after school, anyway. And it's not like people ask me for help every day. Hideaki: But that doesn't mean you should work for these people while they're out having fun. Hideaki: Whatever. How many times have we had this exchange now? I'm sick of telling you this all the time. Shuuji: Sorry. Shuuji: Not really... I don't have any good reason for it. Shuuji: I just figure that being nice to girls could come in handy someday. Hideaki: At this rate, those leeches will suck you dry, dude. Shuuji: I'm obviously not gonna be as lax with my money. Shuuji: It's just... I can't stand that awkwardness you get when turning people down. Anyway, it's different when I have something to do myself, but I don't mind helping when I'm free. Hideaki: ...I swear, you're gonna get scammed real hard at some point, and it'll suck. Girl: Yeah, I can see it now. It's scary just thinking about it. Hideaki: I know, right? You're with me, aren't you, Wakana-chan? Girl: Yeah. It's not normal to accept every single request, if you ask me. You're not hiding something from us, are ya? Shuuji: Err... Wakana: If I had to guess, maybe he's a hardcore masochist? Shuuji: That's a rather extreme assumption. Hideaki: A hardcore masochist?! I see. So you've been taking on all this work in order to get turned on at school... I never would've expected it... Hideaki: You should've told me we were comrades! Shuuji: Keep your fetishes to yourself, dude! You're freaking me out! Wakana: Huh? You mean having girls work you like a dog DOESN'T turn you on? Shuuji: It really stings to see you so genuinely confused by that. Shuuji: And really, girls shouldn't talk about fetishes in the broad daylight. Wakana: What kind of sexist BS is this? Girls are allowed to talk about sex too. Shuuji: Sure, but usually you keep that sort of talk between girls. Shuuji: You got the hots for me or something? Wakana: Hahaha. Nice joke. I know you don't mean that. Hideaki: Though, it is true that girls talking about that stuff can give us guys the wrong idea. Wakana: Well, we only do so around guys we have no interest in. It's just a normal way to make conversation. Don't read too much into it. Shuuji: Either way, I don't get especially happy or anything when people work me. Hideaki: Yeah, sure. Says the guy who takes every request that comes his way. Shuuji: Well... It's just... Shuuji: Won't girls really like me if I never turn them down? Wakana: Ahahahaha! Not at all. If anything, it makes you look like a dumbass. Shuuji: Man, it stings when you say that so bluntly. Hideaki: You need to turn people down every once in a while. You'll get taken advantage of if you let them think you're so soft. Shuuji: You think I'll get taken advantage of...? Now you're just exaggerating. Wakana: I'm not. There are some nasty girls out there who will totally suck you dry with the way you are now. Shuuji: As if. You're clearly overthinking. Wakana: Tch, tch. You're being naive. Women can be much more calculating than you think. Hideaki: They'll make you pay for their food, for movie tickets, and even for accessories like purses! And all they'll give in return is a \"That was a fun way to kill some time. Thanks! See ya♪\" without any progress between the two of you. Hideaki: And then right after that, they'll suddenly call you and ask you to come pick them up because they missed the last train! For freaking real?! There's mischievous and then there's just plain evil! Wakana, Shuuji: ...... Hideaki: Ah?! S-Sorry guys, all my pent-up frustration just kinda exploded there. Shuuji: Looks like you've been through some serious shit, man. Hideaki: Yeah... I used to mess around a lot. But it's all in the past now. Wakana: That sounds like a real nasty girl you ran into. Shuuji: But getting used like that actually made you happy, didn't it? Hideaki: Well... Yeah, a little. Wakana: Ugh, are you grinning?! What a masochist... Terrifying. Shuuji: I seriously don't get how someone can feel pleasure from being treated so crappily. Hideaki: Hehe... That figures. You two are just greenhorns, after all. Shuuji: I'm not planning on ever becoming a masochist veteran. Shuuji: I wouldn't want that... Alright. I'll be more careful from now on. Hideaki: Have you guys forgotten that I'm right here? Hearing that really hurts, you know? Shuuji: I've got a question. Wakana: Go ahead, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: How do I avoid being taken advantage of while coming off as soft? Wakana: Coming off as soft is already a given? Shuuji: I just feel like I'd get on the girls' bad sides if I suddenly changed my whole attitude, which is scary in its own way. Wakana: Well, I guess that's possible. Hideaki: If you want an example of someone who's kind but doesn't get taken advantage of... Wakana: There's Ayachi-san. Hideaki: Oh, right. She's a perfect example. Girl: Yes? You called me? Hideaki: Whoa! A-Ayachi-san?! Ayachi-san: I'm sorry to have startled you. I just so happened to overhear my name when I was passing by. Ayachi-san: Is there something you need with me? Wakana: Oh, uh, don't worry about us. Your name just came up in our conversation. Hideaki: Yeah, we weren't gossiping about you or anything. Shuuji: Sorry if we offended you. Ayachi-san: Oh no, I'm not upset; I was just curious. Please don't mind me. Ayachi-san: Anyway, Kariya-san, about the thing from before... Wakana: Ah! Yeah, it's going great! That place you introduced me to is awesome! Things are going great thanks to you. Thanks so much! Ayachi-san: I'm happy to hear you like it there. Wakana: I'm really thankful to you. Ayachi-san: Please don't hesitate to visit the clubroom again should something else come up. Wakana: Thanks! I will! Schoolgirl B: Ah, Ayachi-saaan! Thanks for letting me borrow your notebook. You were a life-saver. And I have to say, the notes you took were super neat. You're awesome! Ayachi-san: Oh, it was no big deal. More importantly, are you feeling better now? Schoolgirl B: Yeah, I feel great! Ayachi-san: I'm glad to hear that. Is there anything else that is troubling you? Schoolgirl B: No, nothing at the moment. Ayachi-san: I'm willing to help you out or lend an ear to your worries anytime. It doesn't need to be school related; I'm happy to listen to private or other problems too. Schoolgirl B: Thanks. I'll be sure to stop by if something comes up. Ayachi-san: Yes, please do. Shuuji: Huh? Umm... What do you mean? Nene: I'd be glad to help if something should ever concern you. Shuuji: Oh, thanks. I'm happy for the offer, but there's nothing like that right now. Nene: Is that so? For some reason, I got the feeling that there's something worrying you... Shuuji: Y-Yeah...? Shuuji: Yeah...? Nene: No, I haven't... I just had a gut feeling about it. Wakana: Considering how many people you've helped, I think you're right to trust that feeling. Shuuji: What's that supposed to mean? The part about her helping people. Wakana: Oh, whoops... Right... Sorry, Ayachi-san! You're keeping this from the guys, aren't you? Nene: Oh, no, it's not that big of a secret, so don't worry about it. Nene: It would just be a problem for me if people showed up out of curiosity, so I'm asking that you only keep it to people who actually need help. Hideaki: ...? Did we overhear something we shouldn't have? Nene: It's nothing that big... I'm in the OC. Hideaki: OC? Shuuji: Um, you mean... the Occult Club? Nene: Yes. That's right. Shuuji: I didn't know we had one of those at this school. This is the first I'm hearing of it. Hideaki: Same here. And it's not just a circle, but an actual club? Nene: That's right. It's a club that's been around since before we entered this school. Though, I'm currently the only member. Nene: The Student Council has been on our case because of that... After all, the club doesn't do any sort of exhibitions or the like. Hideaki: So... do you research ghosts or something? Or maybe aliens? Nene: No, I am doing divination. \"Occult\" involves the entire spectrum of the supernatural. I am thankfully able to do as I please since I am the only member. Hideaki: By divination you mean, doing hand signs and being like \"And there we have it!\"? Shuuji: It's impressive how old that reference is. I don't think anyone is gonna get that. Wakana: You instantly recognizing it is just as impressive. I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. You guys are such geeks. Right, Ayachi-san? Nene: I obviously can't do Albino Snake Divination. Wakana: You know about it too?! Nene: Yeah, kind of, but I can only do tarot card reading. Divination is nothing more than a hobby for me, after all. Wakana: Anyway, she's also offering counseling there. Nene: It's really just part of the divination I'm doing. It hardly deserves to be called \"counseling.\" Nene: But if you want, don't hesitate to come over to my clubroom anytime, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Oh, sure. Thanks. Schoolgirl A: Ayachi-saaan! I need your help with our classic Japanese homework! Nene: Oh, of course. I'll be right there. Nene: Okay then. I must excuse myself now. Hideaki: She's almost a little too perfect to be real. Hideaki: But anyway, people consult her for a lot of stuff, huh? I would've expected that to turn into a big rumor. Wakana: It's well-known among girls. It'd be a big problem for Ayachi-san if the guys found out and caused a commotion, though. Hideaki: Ah, is that so... Maybe I should pay her a visit too, and then... Ehee! Shuuji: Allow me to read your thoughts: \"Maybe I could get closer to her.\" Hideaki: Huh?! What?! Espers are real? And you're one of them?! Wakana: What're you talking about? You couldn't have been more obvious. You were practically oozing with sleaze. Shuuji: You're even drooling some. Hideaki: Really?! Oh, you're right! Shuuji: I'm guessing that the girls don't spread that rumor around because of how many guys like you there are. Wakana: That's right. You two better keep this to yourselves. Hideaki: Sure. You bet! Shuuji: So anyway, did you also consult her about something, Kariya? I mean, you just thanked her and all. Wakana: I did. I really want something, but I was worried because I didn't have the money for it. Shuuji: What do you want? Wakana: Well... A guitar. Hideaki: A guitar? Sure didn't expect that. Shuuji: You can play the guitar? Well, I guess you wouldn't want one if you couldn't. Wakana: Yeah, a little. Wakana: It's been a few years now, and so I'd like to finally get my own guitar. Shuuji: Huh. My only musical experience comes from music class, though that was ages ago. Hideaki: I could probably play a bit better than Shuuji, then. I had a phase where I was really into music, and so I tried my hand at the guitar. Wakana: Oh, really? That's unexpected. Hideaki: Well, that was a while ago. So? Since you're saving up money, you gonna get a good one? Wakana: Yeah, I'd like a decent one, at least. Though, the prices of musical instruments are pretty crazy. Shuuji: True. Especially vintage instruments. The amount those go for is just bonkers. Wakana: Dad told me to get one with my own money. Would it have killed him to give me at least some of the money for it? Shuuji: So, how did Ayachi-san help you with that? Wakana: She introduced me to a part-time job. Wakana: And now I'm going to finally reach my goal with my next paycheck, meaning I'll be getting my guitar really soon♪ Uhehe. Hideaki: A part-time job, huh? That's nice. Maybe I could have her introduce me to one as well? Wakana: Allow me to read your thoughts: \"Maybe then, I could get closer to her. I could even ask her out on a date to 'repay her' with my first paycheck!\" Hideaki: Is everyone I know a freaking esper?! Shuuji: Look, anyone could guess as much. The fact that she was right just means you're simple. Hideaki: Wh-Whatever! Who cares! Besides, as a guy, I can't let an opportunity to get to know a cute girl like her slip by! Wakana: Well, you have a point... I guess. Shuuji: I'm guessing all the other single guys out there are looking for opportunities too. Student 2: What was it about? I-I want to know... Damn, I'm so jealous of them. Student 3: Damn it... I wanna chat with her too. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Uh... It's nothing. Hideaki: Don't act like this is none of your business. You'd love to get closer with Ayachi-san too, right? Why not get a tarot reading from her? She invited you for one, after all. Shuuji: I dunno... I'll swing by and ask for one once something comes up. Hideaki: What a waste. Wakana: I feel like she wouldn't like it if he went there without a good reason. Hideaki: Huh?! Really? Wakana: Nobody likes a guy who clearly has ulterior motives, you know? Hideaki: Except when you're hot. Wakana: Well, too bad you aren't. Hideaki: Wow! How could you?! Wakana: I don't think girls like Ayachi-san are that shallow. What matters is if you're attractive on the inside, not the outside. Hideaki: I see. Wakana: Besides, people with great personalities wouldn't approach her like that in the first place. Hideaki: Ugh... I guess it's game, set and match for me. Shuuji: Guys, we better head back to class. Afternoon classes are about to start. Wakana: Oh, yeah. Right. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: (Phew...) Shuuji: It's cool. Don't worry about it. Girl: Thanks. Okay then, bye-bye♪ Shuuji: See you tomorrow. Hideaki: So you're still doing this, huh? Shuuji: For today, yeah. It wouldn't be right to turn her down now after I already told her I'd do it. Wakana: Yeah, fair enough. Hideaki: *sigh*... Okay, fine. Want me to give you a hand? Shuuji: Err... Shuuji: I appreciate the sentiment, but no thanks. Hideaki: Knew you'd say that. Wakana: Yeah, it was practically a given. Shuuji: What do you mean? Hideaki: You're a real lone wolf, dude. Shuuji: Okay, look. All I'm doing today is entering some data into their computer database, so I really don't need your help. Shuuji: I'll ask you for help for sure next time something like this happens. Wakana: Stubborn to the end, I see. Hideaki: There's not supposed to be a \"next time.\" You're supposed to turn them down instead. Shuuji: Yeah, yeah. I know. Hideaki: Looks like he's gonna keep on helping people after this. Wakana: That's just how he is. It's not something that can be fixed that easily. Wakana: No point in nagging him about it any further. Hideaki: I'll be on my way, then. What about you, Wakana-chan? Wanna go somewhere if you're free? Wakana: Together with you? Hideaki: Yeah. Wakana: Just the two of us? Hideaki: Yeah! Wakana: Yeah, no way♪ Hideaki: Your blunt replies are too cruel! Wakana: I'm sorry, but I'm busy today. Hideaki: What plans? Wakana: That part-time job. Hideaki: The one Ayachi-san introduced you to? Wakana: Yep. So I don't have time today. Sorry. Hideaki: Work, huh... Well, I guess that's―Huh? Hold on a second. Hideaki: Then why did you ask if it would be the two of us?! Wouldn't that be completely irrelevant?! Wakana: That's just your imagination! Shuuji: If you have school in the day and work in the evening, then doesn't that mean you have no time for homework or studying? Wakana: Yeah, pretty much. I always end up crashing as soon as I come home from work... Wakana: Ugh, our next exams are gonna be rough... Once I get my new guitar, I'm gonna play that bad boy nonstop... Uhehe. Wakana: Oh! I'll be late if I keep standing around chatting like this. See you guys later! Gotta go! Shuuji: See you tomorrow. Hideaki: Don't trip on your shoelaces as you run! Shuuji: Well then, I'll head over to the library now. Hideaki: Yeah, see you. Shuuji: I've been told to come here and register some new books into the library catalog. Committee Girl: Huh? Umm... And you are? I don't remember you being in the Library Committee. Shuuji: I'm filling in for Akita from class 2-A. Apparently, she has something she can't call off and asked me to fill in for her. Committee Girl: Oh, really? If that's how it is... I guess that's alright. Okay, I'm counting on you, then. Shuuji: Sorry, but could you teach me how to do it? Committee Girl: Sure. It's not too hard. Could you sit down at the computer there? Shuuji: Yeah, sure. Committee Girl: So first, you open the database, and then... Okay, there we go. Committee Girl: See the different fields here? Category, title, author, publisher and so on. You have to fill all of them out. Shuuji: I only have to enter the data there and that's it? Committee Girl: Yeah, that's right. Click the register button once they're filled out, and then you'll be back at the main database interface again. Well? Think you can manage? Shuuji: Yeah, probably. Is it okay to ask you if I have any questions later? Committee Girl: Sure thing. Alright, the books you need to register are piled up over here. This is all of them. Shuuji: Got it. Shuuji: Mhm, nnngh... Committee Girl: Umm... You done yet? Shuuji: No, sorry. Shouldn't take much longer, though. Committee Girl: ...Oh. Shuuji: ...... Committee Girl: Huh? Shuuji: I doubt anyone is gonna come by this late anyway, and I can return the key to the faculty room myself once I'm done. Committee Girl: But you aren't on the committee... Shuuji: I've come here to work in place of a Library Committee member. I'm sure me being the one to lock the room up wouldn't be a problem. Committee Girl: You think? Committee Girl: O-Okay then... Could you please handle that for me? Here's the key. Shuuji: Yeah, sure. Committee Girl: Thanks a bunch! I'm off, then! Shuuji: Yeah, bye! Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: ...Hm? Voice: You're kidding me. I came to check up on them since they never came to return the key, and they're nowhere to be seen... I'll need to have a word with them. Girl: Umm, Sensei. Nene: Yes. Time slipped away from me. Sensei: Ah. Well, you shouldn't dawdle around here too much. Nene: Is... there one else here in the library? Sensei: It would seem so. I'm about to lock the room. Nene: I would like you to let me look something up before that. Could you lend me the key? Sensei: You want to look something up this late? Nene: Yes, just something about tarot cards. It won't take much time at all. I'll just need five... no, maybe twenty minutes. Please.  Sensei: ...Well, I suppose I can trust you. Okay, here's the key. Sensei: However, you are to return it to the faculty room within thirty minutes. And make absolutely sure that the room is locked when you leave. Nene: Understood. Thank you very much. Sensei: Alright, goodbye. Nene: Y-Yes... Goodbye... *pant* *pant*... Shuuji: (......?) Shuuji: (...What?) Nene: Ah... ah! Mh... Mhh, mh, mh, mhhh... Shuuji: ......

I'm cumming, I'm cumming, I'm cumming, I'm cumming, I'm cumming! Nene: Mhh, mhhhhhhhhhhhh!! Nene: I don't want to move now, but she'll come to check otherwise... I need, to hurry... *pant*... *pant*... But I can't, get any strength, into my body... "

            "Taichi: Uh, hello? You're burning the meat. Shuuji: Huh? Oh, crap! Shuuji: Yeah, you're right. Sorry. Taichi: Thanks for the food. So, something troubling you? Shuuji: Yeah... Dad, has anyone ever asked you, \"what's more important, your work or me\"? Taichi: Where did that come from? Oh, wait, did you actually get a girlfriend? Shuuji: No, this isn't about me. I'm talking about someone else. They came to ask me for help. Taichi: What, really? Man, we really won't be getting a grandchild, darling... Shuuji: You don't need to tell Mom stuff like that. Taichi: The fact that people are coming to you for help shows that you've grown, though. Maybe my dreams really will come true... Taichi: Not with your mother; she was too kind a woman. But someone else did ask me that once. Shuuji: Yeah? How'd you answer? Taichi: I said, \"Let me ask you this: would you prefer me having a job, or being unemployed?\" Shuuji: And then what happened? Taichi: She got really angry and yelled, \"That's not the point here!\" We broke up shortly after. I still don't really understand what happened. Shuuji: You broke up? That's it? Taichi: Yeah. She kept asking me questions like that. Let me tell you, there's no dealing with a woman like that! Shuuji: Yeah... I dunno how I'd think about that. Sounds like it'd be a pain. Taichi: Don't act so picky if you've never even dated anyone. Shuuji: That's harsh, man... Taichi: So, why do you ask? Shuuji: Well, the two of them love each other, but they're struggling to let each other know how they feel. I can't see a solution to the problem. Shuuji: Even if you love someone, you've gotta work, right? But what are you meant to do so that your relationship doesn't fall apart? Taichi: Without just breaking up? Shuuji: Preferably. Taichi: Let's see, then... One thing you could do is take a day off from work and spend that time with your partner. Shuuji: A day off, you say... Taichi: And I don't just mean take them to your work with you. They'd ditch for sure if you did that. Taichi: It's only a temporary fix, but it's a good way to keep both parties happy. Though, the problems will end up coming round again. Shuuji: Yeah... You're right. Taichi: Nothing will change if you keep working the same hours. If it becomes too much of a problem, the two of them are better off breaking up and finding partners who suit their needs more. Taichi: But some people don't want anything to be more important than themselves. That can easily become an irreconcilable difference. It's just who they are, at a fundamental level. Shuuji: Isn't that a little extreme? Taichi: I'm sure even you get lonely and maybe even jealous when you see one of your few friends being friendly with their other friends, right? It's the same in love. Shuuji: Sure, I get lonely, but... jealous? Taichi: Think about if you only had one friend, but that friend had many others. You'd just be one of his many friends. You'd most certainly feel jealous. That's normal. Shuuji: Hmm... Yeah, I guess. Taichi: That's the same kind of situation. If you don't want your partner to be like that, then no amount of talking will fix things. It's a problem with who they are at a basic level. Shuuji: But I doubt you're going to find anyone that perfect, are you? Taichi: Most people get like that, yes. But what's most important is forgiveness and the will to stick together. Shuuji: ...You know, you're pretty smart, Dad. Taichi: Having kids will make you grow up in a hurry. Especially for me, since I have to manage people in my work too. Taichi: Though, I've learned all this after school. It's probably different while you're still there. Taichi: You need to give up on talking this one through. Unless you can change these people's personalities, you're just smoothing over the cracks in the foundation. Meguru: I do! Nene: Okay then, Inaba-san. Meguru: We'll have her confront him! \"Which is more important, me or your team?!\" Shuuji: %130;Are you trying to make things worse?! Meguru: ...Is that a bad idea? Shuuji: Definitely. They'd break up for sure after that! Meguru: Huh, that's weird... It worked in the dating sim I played the other day. I fixed the characters' relationship and got the good ending. Shuuji: 2D and 3D are completely different! Tsumugi: Okay... We could have them set up days with mandatory dates. Like, several times a month. Tsumugi: They have to come to a compromise. Obviously, it's okay for him to focus on basketball, but he needs to spend what extra time he has with his girlfriend. Tsumugi: This way no one has to give up completely on anything, right? Touko: That might work... But don't you think it would put a lot of pressure on Shiba-kun? Shuuji: And wouldn't it be awkward for them to be forced on a date? Tsumugi: Well... I guess. Higo-san might worry about him only being there because he has to. Shuuji: Have your games and manga given you any other ideas, Inaba-san? Ones that don't involve a dramatic confrontation, preferably. Meguru: Errm, let's see... The problem here is that basketball is taking up too much of his time... Meguru: Even though Higo-san's a girl? Touko: She could be the manager. Nene: They would be able to spend time together if she did. Tsumugi: But that doesn't fix their lack of dates, does it? Touko: That's true... Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Actually... Shuuji: That might be a good idea. Meguru: Senpai? Shuuji: The fundamental problem here is that the two of them don't have anything in common that's important to the both of them. Shuuji: Then they'd be sharing a common purpose, a goal they can work together toward. Don't you think Shiba-kun would be happy about that? Tsumugi: She'll start off caring about that one member most, but I'm sure she'll want to support the whole team on their road to the Nationals once she sees how hard they're working. Meguru: I think it's a good idea. Having your girlfriend as your manager, then taking her to the Nationals... That makes for such a good story! Tsumugi: If they agree to this, it would be the easiest solution, right? Touko: But having your girlfriend around might be distracting too. Particularly for his lower muscles♪ Mufufu. Shuuji: ...Togakushi-senpai, a girl your age shouldn't be saying that stuff. Touko: But you're blushing. I bet you're imagining it, aren't you? You naughty boy. Shuuji: I'm not the only one with a red face. Just look at Inaba-san. Meguru: Hey, what are you bringing me into this for?! Tsumugi-senpai's face is just as red! Tsumugi: Whaaa?! D-Don't get me involved too! Touko: Mufufu, maybe you two are just as perverted as him? Meguru: I-I am not perverted! I most certainly am not! Tsumugi: M-Me neither! Anyway, we're trying to solve a problem here! Does anyone have any other ideas?! I think we should go with Hoshina-kun's suggestion! Meguru: N-No objections from me! None at all! Touko: I agree too. Nene: Very well. Then I'll let Higo-san know how Shiba-kun feels and suggest that she joins the basketball club. Nene: Hoshina-kun, Togakushi-senpai, could you go and talk to Shiba-kun for me? Touko: Sure, you got it. Basketball Club Member: Luckily for us, this girl here wishes to be our manager! Student: I'm Higo Mayuko. I'm a beginner when it comes to basketball, but I'll work my hardest to give you all the support you need! Student: But I've never been a manager before... Won't I just get in the way? Shuuji: For the two of them, at least... Basketball Club Member: Now we have double the motivation to win those finals! Basketball Club: Like hell we do! Basketball Club Member A: She's your girlfriend! Basketball Club Member C: Screw this. You're the only one motivated here! Basketball Club Member B: Bringing your love life to the team? Give me a break! Shuuji: The team looks like it's about to collapse... Shuuji: We should have told them that she wasn't becoming a manager just so they'd have more time to flirt... Touko: I think they know that better than anyone, don't you? Student: U-Umm! I plan on taking this seriously and working hard so that you can all get to the Nationals! Student: I've already made some drinks and bottled them up for you. I've also been learning how to bandage and ice injuries. I swear I'll do a great job! Basketball Club Member B: Drinks... A girl's homemade drinks... Basketball Club Member A: Bandaging... Icing... Basketball Club Member C: Skin contact... Basketball Club: Welcome to the team! Basketball Club Member: If any of you get any wise ideas, I'll kick the shit outta you! Shuuji: %130;They're that easy?! Shuuji: Now I feel like they'll break up for a completely different reason... Shuuji: Yeah, you're right. Touko: Love really is amazing. Mm... I'm even more interested in it. Shuuji: Is there anyone you're interested in, Senpai? Touko: Unfortunately not. I've never fallen for anyone before, I'm embarrassed to say... Touko: I called myself a beginner, but I'm actually even less than that. *sigh* I'm completely hopeless. Shuuji: I wouldn't get that down about it... Touko: I mean... I'm starting to worry that I'm simply not capable of love. I'm already this old without having my first love. Touko: I pine after love so badly, but I may never fall in love with anyone... Maybe I'm just destined to grow old and die alone? Shuuji: I don't think that's true. Touko: Really? Shuuji: People like that typically have no interest in love at all. Shuuji: But you're at least interested in love, Senpai, so I think you'll be okay. Touko: I hope you're right... Touko: To be honest, I joined the OC partly because I thought I could learn some more about love by helping people with their romantic troubles. Touko: But it just keeps getting more and more mysterious... It seems like something you have to experience for yourself to understand. Shuuji: Senpai... Maybe you're setting your ideals too high? Touko: Huh? Do I look the type to demand my boyfriend be hot, smart, and earning over a million yen a year? Shuuji: Oh, no, that's not what I meant. I wasn't talking about your ideals for men, but your ideals for love. Shuuji: The woman and her boyfriend that you see in your dreams look really happy, right? Touko: Yes, incredibly happy. Seeing them always makes me envious. Shuuji: Maybe you've seen so much of them that you now think love has to instantly make you as happy as them? Shuuji: That might not be a conscious thought, but something niggling in the back of your mind. Touko: Hmm... I wouldn't be surprised if it was. Shuuji: I'm sure you'll meet the man for you one day, Senpai. Someone who will be even better than your wildest love fantasies. Shuuji: Your love batteries are still charging, is all. Touko: You think so? Thank you. That made me feel a little better. Touko: Are your love batteries charging too then, Hoshina-kun? Shuuji: They certainly are. Touko: Nothing important. I was just thinking about how the two of us are different after all. Shuuji: Huh? You think? Touko: Yeah. Not just with your outlook on love, but with Higo-san's problem too. I never even thought about what was important to them, or if they needed to share something. Touko: I only brought up the idea of her becoming his manager at random. We might both be beginners when it comes to love, but there's still a big difference between us. Shuuji: Ohh, that's what you're talking about... Shuuji: I didn't do anything that great. I'm sure you could have come to the same conclusion if you had a bit longer to think about it. Touko: No way. I would never have thought of that. I'm too boring of a person. Shuuji: You're either being far too harsh on yourself or are way overestimating me here... Shuuji: Actually, I'm sorry! I've been misleading you! Touko: ...? What do you mean? Shuuji: Well, um, you see... Shuuji: All that stuff about what's important to people... I said it like I thought of it all myself, but I was actually just repeating what my dad told me. Shuuji: I was too embarrassed to say I had discussed it with my dad... Shuuji: I know I was overthinking it... But part of me also wanted to seem cool. Shuuji: I had to talk to my dad because I couldn't think of anything, either. So I really haven't done anything special. Touko: I see... That's a bit of a relief. Shuuji: It is? Touko: Yup, it is. I mean, during our date, I told you we were similar, didn't I? Shuuji: I'm sorry. It was all an act. We're similar after all. Touko: We're similar, huh... Shuuji: I'll be honest with you, Senpai... Most days I think to myself about how nice it would be if I had a girlfriend. Touko: ...... Touko: Hey, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Yes? Touko: At the OC we help people with their problems... Is it okay for us to help our fellow club members out when they have a problem? Shuuji: Well... That sounds fine to me. Don't see why it wouldn't be. Touko: Would that include an upperclassman's frivolous worries? Shuuji: It doesn't matter if your problems are frivolous or not. And it certainly doesn't matter if they're older or younger. Shuuji: We've never discriminated over who we help before, and we're not about to start now. Touko: I see... Touko: Then there's something I'd like to ask of you, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: ...Where are you going with this? Touko: Would you study with me? Shuuji: Study with you? I mean, I don't mind, but our midterms only just finished, so... Touko: Not that kind of studying. I'm talking about studying love. Shuuji: ......... Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: ... Shuuji: Come again? Touko: I'm asking if you'll study love with me? Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Whaaaaaaaaa?! "

Touko: Lost in thought, huh? Shuuji: Ah... Hey there, Togakushi-senpai. Touko: Can't bear to face Inaba-san? Shuuji: No, that's not it... Touko: Alrighty. Well then, let your big sis here lend you an ear. Touko: Talking to someone might help you sort out your thoughts, no matter who it is. Shuuji: ...Thank you. Touko: It makes sense that you'd be worried about the hole in your heart, given that you were born with that magic of yours. Shuuji: Right... I mean, I still don't really understand much about it. Touko: Yeah, and it's not like you got it because you wanted it. Shuuji: ...But it's true that my ability is what allowed me to start dating Meguru, so I don't hate it anymore. Touko: That's good. There's no point in hating it, so that's for the best. Shuuji: Right. I realize that my ability is a part of who I am, and Meguru loves me along with it. Touko: Ohh, what an awesome thing to say. You looked really cool there. Shuuji: Thank you... But, how do I put it... Touko: Hm? Shuuji: Meguru seems desperate to fill the hole in my heart... which only makes me feel worse about the situation. Touko: Say, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Yeah...? Touko: Magic is granted to people with wishes they want fulfilled, yeah? Shuuji: That's what I've heard. I don't know what Ayachi-san and Shiiba-san's wishes are, though. Touko: I see. But... Touko: ...What about your magic? Shuuji: Huh? Touko: Well, you have magic too, right? Shuuji: Yeah, but I just inherited it from my mom. Touko: But from what I've heard, your magic is similar but different. Shuuji: Well... Yeah... Touko: So I'm wondering why you have it. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: ...... Touko: Hm? Shuuji: Thank you. Touko: Don't thank me. I was just thinking aloud a little. Shuuji: Still. Shuuji: Meguru, sorry! Meguru: What?! Meguru: Umm, what is it...? Shuuji: I have to go now. There's somewhere I gotta go today. Meguru: O-Okay... Meguru: A-Alright then, Senpai. Umm... See you tomorrow! Shuuji: Yeah, see you tomorrow. Meguru: ...... Shuuji: Hello. Thanks again for the help a while back. I'm wondering, can you spare another moment for me? Nanao: Hmm... Okay. I'll close the cafe. Shuuji: Huh? Nanao: You've come here looking for help with something, right? Have a seat here and wait a moment. Shuuji: ...Thank you. Shuuji: ...What do you think, Souma-san? Nanao: I figured you might come to me with those questions one day... Which is why I've given them a lot of thought myself. Shuuji: I'd really appreciate it. Nanao: A witch may be gathering other people's heart fragments, but those are just the ingredients. The magic is formed according to the contractor's own wish and feelings. Nanao: So yes, it exists to fulfill their wish. Nanao: And like I told you before, there is no doubt that the ability you possess is magical in nature. Shuuji: ...But it's not like I got this ability because I was trying to fulfill some wish. Shuuji: ...Right. Nanao: And since it's magic, it also has a purpose that goes along with it. Nanao: Both you and your mother should have different purposes. Nanao: Your magic and hers are similar, but not the same. You possess your own magic. Shuuji: Which means my ability must have some kind of purpose... Shuuji: But, still― Nanao: I have a question I'd like to ask you first. Shuuji: Ah, s-sure. Nanao: Correct me if I'm wrong, but is it possible that you've been sensing the emotions of everyone other than Meguru less lately? Shuuji: Um... Yeah. I have been. Nanao: So then... Nanao: Doesn't that mean that a degree of directionality or selectivity has developed for your ability? Nanao: Basically, it's becoming possible for you to control it. Shuuji: ...... Nanao: How you absorbed the Meguru's fragments a while back is another example. Nanao: You were present for several other occasions where fragments were collected, but that was the only time you absorbed them during the collection process. Nanao: Don't you think the reason for that lies within you? Not that you did this intentionally, of course. Shuuji: So I've become able to control my ability... Nanao: ...Your magic is an extremely unusual case. Nanao: But nonetheless, it is still magic. So what this all comes down to is... Nanao: What is it you really wish for? The answer to that question is the key to everything. Shuuji: What I wish for... Nanao: Maybe your heart is waiting for you to find the answer to that question. Nanao: Maybe you're subconsciously aware that such an answer exists. Shuuji: ...... Nanao: Have a sip of coffee. Shuuji: ...Yeah, good idea. Nanao: Glad to hear that. Nanao: ...It's said that we evolved a sense of taste in order to judge whether something is dangerous or okay to eat. Shuuji: O-Okay? Nanao: However, humans have no need for that anymore. Instead, they only use it for enjoying the taste of food. Nanao: People living in this day and age never even think about the original purpose of their taste buds anymore. Shuuji: ...... Nanao: But that purpose is clear and immutable. Nanao: You have it to protect your very life. "

            "Wakana: Oh, morning, Hoshina. Hideaki: Yo. Shuuji: Morning, guys. Wakana: Yeah, I have... Sorry again for the headaches I caused on Saturday. Shuuji: I'm sorry too. I really screwed up a lot during our act. Wakana, Hideaki: Yeah, you sure did. Shuuji: ...Isn't this the part where you all go, \"Hey, don't worry about it. We weren't much better\"? Wakana: Really, I think we should all be thanking Ayachi-san. Hideaki: Yeah. She really saved our asses. She got the crowd hyped enough to ignore all our screwups. Shuuji: Personally, I would have loved to hear you sing on stage. Wakana: I'll go back to practicing by myself for a while. I learned through this that I still have a long way to go. Hideaki: Well, call me if you ever do plan on playing or singing anywhere. I'll come and listen. Shuuji: Huh? Like, I'm obviously not gonna play again, but can't you join her as a drummer? Hideaki: Look... I've been reminded of a harsh lesson through this... Nobody cares about the drummer! Shuuji: Ah... Nene: O-Oh no, I'm really not that good... I was only able to sing well thanks to the rest of the band. Hideaki: Yeah... But it's way too late for me to switch tracks now. Wakana: There's no way girls would swarm you like that either way. The vocalist should have some class. Hideaki: Especially not if I'm trying to sing while drumming. So yeah, I've officially given up on music for the second time on Saturday. Shuuji: That's kind of a waste, but I guess I have no room to talk since I'm quitting too. Wakana: Exactly. Shuuji: Hm? Nene: E-Excuse me for a moment. I need to talk to Hoshina-kun. Nene: So, it would appear that some of my fragments have returned again. Shuuji: Huh? You mean the fragments I absorbed? Nene: Yes. I haven't received fragments from anywhere else lately. Nene: Absolutely. I only noticed it last night, but... Nene: It must have been the Halloween party when it happened.  Shuuji: ...Now that you mention it, I think I felt a strange sensation around when the party was ending. Nene: Which means the successful party and performance has filled up your heart somewhat again. Shuuji: It's true that I felt a sense of fulfillment and accomplishment. Hmm... Shuuji: Judging by the amount in the bottle, I suppose not all fragments have returned yet, huh? Nene: Yes, unfortunately not. Shuuji: You're not about to tell me to keep playing in the band, are you? I doubt throwing another party would do anything for me. Nene: ...Could you keep going? Shuuji: No. No way. That may have been a fulfilling experience but to continue would be a whole nother story. Shuuji: Like, you wouldn't want me to ask you to keep singing, would you?  Nene: No, I wouldn't. You don't have to worry. I won't make any such requests of you. Shuuji: ...Sorry. I wish I could just give you back these fragments right now. Nene: It's okay. Even if it's little by little, I'm just happy they're coming back. Shuuji: Yeah, but the longer it takes to return your fragments, the longer you'll, umm... keep getting those fits of arousal. Nene: ――― Shuuji: Okay, don't say it! I already know I went too far! Nene: Exactly. My pain would be over if you returned them to me right now... And yet, and yet... Could it be you actually enjoy making me m-m-masturbate? Shuuji: NO! Absolutely not! I'm trying to return them to you as soon as humanly possible! Nene: That look on your face... You don't really want to return them, do you? I see how it is. That must be why you're quitting the band... Shuuji: Now, hold on! You're way off the mark! Please bring back the calm and understanding Ayachi-san! Kanae: Hey, you two. What are you doing outside the classroom? Get your heads out of the party mentality and start focusing on school now. Shuuji: Oh, sorry! Come on, Ayachi-san! Nene: Phew... I'm sorry for acting out this morning. Shuuji: No, it was my fault for bringing it up... Shuuji: Yeah, you're right. So in return... Wait, actually, that's not the right phrasing. Shuuji: Anyway, I've recalled something else. Nene: Okay...? Shuuji: You haven't retrieved fragments from Inaba-san yet, right? Nene: Oh, right. You're correct. I haven't yet. Shuuji: It wasn't possible before, but I wondered about whether it'd be now. Shuuji: It seems like she's getting along better with her classmates lately. Nene: ...Is that so? Shuuji: Yeah. A lot of them voted for her during the party. Shuuji: She finished in eighth place thanks to them. They all surrounded her and complimented her, kinda like what our classmates did with you this morning. Seeing that reminded me about this. Nene: Oh... I didn't know that. Nene: But now that you mention it, she did say that they were going out to eat cake together. Shuuji: Yeah, that is why I wondered if she had any fragments to collect. Nene: ...Yeah, it sounds like retrieval should be possible. Nene: Thank you for the suggestion; it was very helpful. I hadn't thought of that myself. Shuuji: Oh, you're welcome. Shuuji: If it means proving that I'm not stalling just so I can keep you horny, then... Nene: ――― Shuuji: Crap, I said something I shouldn't have again, didn't I?! Nene: I don't care anymore... I'm a filthy m-masturbater. That's just who I am... You don't need to sugarcoat it. Shuuji: Snap out of it! Please! Think about the fragments you may be able to retrieve! Nene: And also, I will look for a good opportunity after school to check whether retrieval is possible. Shuuji: Roger that. Nene: ...... Shuuji: Hm? What is it? Nene: Oh, nothing. I just thought you answered like Inaba-san. Shuuji: ...Oh yeah. I did, huh? That just kinda happened automatically. Nene: ...... Meguru: Hey! Wait for me! Nene: Huh? Inaba-san? Meguru: What have you two been talking about? Let me join the fun! Nene: Nngh. W-Well... Meguru: You went to the clubroom just for that? I didn't know you were such a courteous guy. So you really do care about manners, huh, Senpai? Shuuji: Hey, what's that supposed to mean? Meguru: Actually, why'd you have to be alone for that? This is kinda fishy... Shuuji: Moving on! What brings you to the clubroom? Meguru: Oh, right. I went over to your class to chat with you, but you weren't there. Then Tsumugi-senpai told me you went to the clubroom. Meguru: I thought you might be bragging to everyone about your shiny new armor, so I wanted to set the record straight and let them know I did all the work. Shuuji: What kinda reason is that? Though, I can't deny that it was all thanks to you... Shuuji: Hmm, let's see... I honestly feel bad about being the only one getting help. Shuuji: Like, what about... Ayachi-san? Nene: ...Yeah. Meguru: Oh, right. Don't worry. I'll help you too, of course! Nene: Actually... I've already got it taken care of. Nene: Anyway, Hoshina-kun, we should head back to class now. See you after school, Inaba-san. Meguru: Oh, okay... Roger... Meguru: Hmm... Shuuji: Well? How's it look? Nene: Unfortunately the bottle didn't react. It seems she hasn't yet reached the state where retrieval is possible. Shuuji: Oh, I see... Nene: Like I said before, I can only really guess, but... Nene: Probably once she has found someone she can fully open up to and trust, and vice versa. Shuuji: And she doesn't have anyone like that yet... Meguru: \"And I know how few people there are like me when it comes to friendship, socializing and all that...\" Nene: Pain...? You mean that literally? Shuuji: Yeah. I think the emotion behind that was probably something like fear or regret. Shuuji: Also, I perceived a bittersweet taste. I don't really know what emotion was behind that, but... Meguru: \"I doubt things would've went well even without the cold. Ahaha...\" Shuuji: ...I felt like it was complicated and deep-rooted. Nene: I would have to assume. She must have some deeper concerns if her getting along with her classmates isn't enough. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: ...I want to help her. Shuuji: Oh, yeah, that's certainly a factor, but I want to help her even putting the fragments aside. Shuuji: We promised her that we would help her to do something about this. Nene: ...... Nene: Okay, but I think it would be best if I left this to you. Shuuji: ...Huh? Nene: I feel like that's the best approach. After all... Nene: It seems like you're the one who's closest with her at the moment. Shuuji: W-Wait, that's not... Nene: Am I wrong? Shuuji: W-Well, like, doesn't she always latch onto you the moment she sees you? She doesn't do that with me! Shuuji: It's obvious that she really likes you. But me on the other hand... Nene: ...So then, can I leave this to you? Shuuji: R-Roger that. Shuuji: E-Er, that was on purpose this time! Nene: *stare* Tsumugi: Right. You'll get exhausted at this rate. Nene: I'm sorry... I hope this doesn't keep up for tomorrow... Touko: I think it'll let up after a day. You were pretty blunt when turning them down, so I'm sure everyone will get the message. Nene: I sure hope so... Touko: Anyway, is it alright for me to continue coming? Nene: Of course. I don't mind at all if you don't mind. Touko: I definitely don't mind. I have more free time than I know what to do with now that I've retired from the Student Council. Touko: Doing nothing but studying is so boring, so I'd love to keep coming if that's alright with you. Poor old me has nowhere else to call home anymore... Tsumugi: You're already one of us to me. I'd really like it if you kept coming. Touko: I'm so happy to hear that! Nene: Okay, then. Let's go home for today. Touko, Tsumugi: Okay. "

Shuuji: ...... Nene: ...... Shuuji: ...Yeah, there is. Nene: Could you tell me about it? Shuuji: Okay. The truth is, as embarrassing as it is to admit... Shuuji: It's about Meguru. I like her. I really like her. Nene: ...I see. Shuuji: I don't think she hates me or anything, but my power can only read feelings, not thoughts... Shuuji: So... I know this is pathetic, but I'm afraid of taking that step forward, you know? Nene: ...... Shuuji: Especially since I made her really mad again yesterday...

I was really embarrassed, and I also didn't know if it was okay to ask for more. Shuuji: I couldn't tell what you were thinking... Meguru: I thought you were able to read other people's emotions. Meguru: Can't you read my feelings right now? Shuuji: Well... Meguru: Then read them! I'm terrible at expressing my feelings, and I hate it! Meguru: Besides, unlike you, I can't tell anything at all... Meguru: That's why I keep agonizing over this... Meguru: About how you think of me. Meguru: About whether you feel the same as I do. Meguru: About how I should convey my feelings. Meguru: I just... Meguru: Aah! Meguru: I love you too! Meguru: You said it! You finally said it, Senpai!

It's a little embarrassing to hear that, but I'm happy. Tsumugi: This is such a relief. I've actually found something I can―Ah... Urgh! Shuuji: Something you can... \"urgh\"? Meguru: Huh?

You should take it easy and go home early if you're still feeling sick. Meguru: I'm sorry. I got a little carried away there. Tsumugi: No, it's not your fault. That was just, umm... a physical condition of mine acting up. Shuuji: A physical condition? Meguru: You mean, like, how some people get a stomach ache when they're nervous? Tsumugi: I guess it's sorta like that. But it's not about nervousness at all. In my case, it's, umm... Tsumugi: I can't hold it in whenever I dress like a girl. Meguru: When you dress like a girl...? Shuuji: And by you can't hold it in, you mean that you barf? Tsumugi: ...... Shuuji: Could be... Meguru: Do you have some sort of trauma involving girl's clothing or something? Shuuji: Hey, should you really be asking her that? Meguru: Oh, you're right! I'm sorry for blurting out such a personal question like that... Tsumugi: No, it's okay. I don't have any traumas or anything. I actually really like girl's clothes. Meguru: So it's just a super rare physical condition? Tsumugi: Ah... Yeah, something like that... Shuuji: ...Hm? Nene: Hoshina-kun, is something the matter? Shuuji: Ah, no... It's nothing. Tsumugi: Yeah... I can push things to some degree, but it's hard to know when I'll reach my limit. Meguru: But then you hit that limit and ended up puking anyway... Tsumugi: ...I'm really sorry. I was so happy at the prospect of looking girly that I forgot myself... I thought I could handle some more. Tsumugi: I know... I'm weird, aren't I? Meguru: Well, that just means that instead of changing your hairstyle, we should start with smaller accessories next time! Tsumugi: ...Huh? Meguru: What? You don't want to? Should I stop trying to push this stuff on you? Tsumugi: N-No! That's not it! I'm actually really happy! Tsumugi: But... doesn't my condition put you off? Meguru: Huh? No, of course not! Meguru: It's only got me more pumped, actually! Now I want to do whatever it takes to make you look girly!

I'd love help if possible, but there's only so much we can do if we're fighting against a physical condition. Shuuji: You're right, but there's something that I― Nene: Ah, please come in! Touko: Pardon me. Touko: Hey there! You all working hard? Shuuji: Togakushi-senpai? Nene: What brings you here? Is there something you need to relay to us? Touko: Nah. I'm here for something else today. I need your help with something, actually. Nene: By that, you mean you're here to consult us on a problem? Touko: Yep. Your club helps out other students, yeah? Nene: Yes... But I find it unusual that you would come for our help. Touko: Yeah, I usually try to handle things myself. I'm in a bit over my head this time, though. Touko: So, could I please have your help? Nene: Of course. We'll gladly help out in any way we can. Touko: Thanks. I really appreciate it! Nene: Hoshina-kun, about what you were trying to say... Shuuji: Oh, don't worry about it. Togakushi-senpai's problem is more important right now. Nene: I see... Then please tell me about it some other day. Touko: By the way, who are those two? I haven't seen them around before. Are they new members? I did receive a report on something like that... Touko: Huh? I'm pretty sure the report mentioned only one new member. Meguru: Ah, yeah! That was probably about me. I'm Inaba Meguru from class 1-D. Touko: Nice to meet you. I'm the Student Council president, Togakushi Touko. Tsumugi: And, um, I may be in a boy's uniform, but I'm a perfectly normal girl! I'm Shiiba Tsumugi. I transferred into class 2-A today! Touko: Ahh, right, right. I heard that I girl with some special circumstances transferred in today. Touko: Right, so that's you, huh? Now I know what they meant by \"special circumstances.\" Tsumugi: There are some private reasons why I have to dress like this... I'm sorry. Touko: Don't worry about it. The school gave permission, so it's all good. I don't see a problem with having a girl like you here. Touko: So anyway, did you join the Occult Club too? Tsumugi: Only on a trial basis. I think I'll join if I can manage to keep up. Touko: Oho... I see your harem is growing, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: That's not what I'm going for, and you know it. Touko: Oh, please～ I know you're thrilled about this. You're living every boy's dream. As a healthy young man, you must have it pretty \"hard,\" huh? Mufufu. Shuuji: Stop with the terrible dirty jokes! Shuuji: We all take this club very seriously! Touko: Okay, okay. That's good to hear. Touko: Shiiba-san, let's get along. Feel free to come to me if there's anything you ever need help with. Tsumugi: Okay. Thank you, Togakushi-senpai. Touko: Then again... I plan on retiring very soon. Tsumugi: Oh. Is that so? Touko: It's already fall, after all. That's when the president retires―or at least, that's how it usually goes. I don't know what's going to happen this time, though... Shuuji: Huh? What do you mean by that? It's not like you won't retire, right? Touko: Of course I'm going to. I'm not about to spend another year here. The problem is the next president... Nene: That's right... The presidential candidates haven't been announced yet. Nene: Considering the time of the year, won't it be a problem if they're not announced soon? Shuuji: Would it? Touko: We would love to, but... I'm in a bit of a bind regarding that. Shuuji: That's what you've come to the OC for? Touko: Yep. That's what I'd like your help with. Shuuji: Umm, incidentally, is it okay for you to be telling us this stuff? Touko: Don't worry. None of it is exactly top-secret information. Nene: So, what is the problem? Touko: The fact is, there are no candidates yet. We don't have any to announce. With the way things are going, I might have to retire without anyone to take over. Shuuji: Wow, that's a pretty serious problem. Meguru: Umm, do you usually have a lot of candidates every year? I'm still a first-year, so I don't know... Meguru: But I feel like seeing more than one would be pretty weird. Touko: That's generally how it is here. We never have enough candidates for a real election, so we just run an approval vote. Shuuji: But it looks like even an approval vote won't be possible this year, huh? Touko: For lesser posts like secretary or vice president, we can decide the president first and then have them appoint everyone else. Nene: But that approach isn't possible if you don't have a presidential candidate to begin with. Touko: That's right. So I just don't know what to do anymore... Nene: But, Togakushi-senpai, I thought you usually have one of the current second-year Student Council members run. Touko: True, that is how it often goes. I used to be the secretary. But it's just a custom; I can't force anyone. Shuuji: Is there anyone who'd be fit for office from your point of view? Touko: There is. My current vice president, Koshiji-san. Touko: She's super cute! And her skin is really smooth. She's a very charming girl. Shuuji: None of that has anything to do with her qualifications. Koshiji-san, though... I think she'd do a good job. Meguru: Do you know her, Senpai? Shuuji: I was in the same class as her last year. I even filled in for her class rep duties a few times because the Student Council kept her so busy. Shuuji: She was actually the vice president? Touko: She was the treasurer and became the vice president following last fall's elections. Meguru: ...Senpai, you should pay more attention to these things. Shuuji: Well, err... Yeah, you're right. Though, I don't think many students here pay much attention to the Student Council. Touko: Tell me about it. The whole reason we have no candidates is because nobody seems to care. Touko: We've even been handing out fliers to let everyone know about our lack of candidates, you know? Shuuji: Oh, that's right. I saw you talking to Koshiji-san? Was that maybe about this? Touko: You saw that? How embarrassing... But you're right. I asked her to run, but she turned me down. Touko: She's got a magnetic personality and has been a member of the Student Council since she was a freshman. She's way more capable than I am. I would've been thrilled if she took over. Tsumugi: Why doesn't she want to run? Touko: She wouldn't say. And not only is she not running, she's quitting the Student Council outright. Shuuji: Is this sudden? Has she shown signs of wanting to quit before? Touko: Nope. She took everyone on the council by surprise. We were all convinced that she'd run for president. Tsumugi: Do you think she got fed up with Student Council work? Touko: Not from what I can tell, I don't think... Touko: Her attendance rate is very high, and she always happily does her job. She often stays late with me, after everyone else has already gone home. Tsumugi: Then what could be the reason? Shuuji: Is this just, like, a sudden change of heart? I dunno why she wouldn't tell you the reason, though. Nene: Can we take it that you want us to convince Koshiji-san to stay, then? Touko: Ah, no, sorry. Like I said earlier, I can't force anyone. Touko: I don't want you to convince her. I want you to help me find another candidate. Nene: Is there no one else in the Student Council who wants to run? Touko: Hmm, not really... Everyone else thinks Koshiji-san is perfect for the job, so they're all hesitating, or more like, afraid to take on that role for themselves. Touko: I may have a member run as a last resort, but I'm hoping someone steps up on their own. It'd be awfully nice if we could find a willing regular student. Touko: There are a lot of students like Hoshina-kun who aren't very clued-in, yeah? I'm hoping that there's someone out there who will step up once they hear what's happening. Nene: Okay, I understand the situation now. Touko: So... Can I take it that you're going to help me? Nene: Yes. I don't know how much we'll be able to help, but we'll do what we can. Touko: Thanks! You're the best! Nene: So, if you don't mind, I'd like to ask a few questions about the Student Council... Touko: And that's about all you need to know. Nene: Thank you for the explanation. I suppose we'll just have to ask around. Meguru: Umm, can first-years run for president? Touko: They can. Second-years running is just a custom, not a rule. There have been some first-year presidents, actually. Touko: Are you interested, Inaba-san? Would you like some... private tutoring? I'll teach you everything you need to know and then some, with just the two of us... Mufufu! Meguru: N-No thanks! I don't swing that way! And I doubt I'd be a very good president, anyway. Meguru: I'll ask my friends to see if anyone's interested. Touko: Yeah? Bummer. As long as you have the motivation for it, you don't need to worry about the actual work; you'll have the help of everyone on the council. Meguru: Got it. I'll let them know that. Touko: On that note, I would even welcome a fresh transfer student, as long as they were motivated. Tsumugi: Umm... I'll give it some thought. Touko: Okay, please do. Touko: Alright, then. I'm sorry for asking you all to pick up my slack, but... Nene: We will do what we can. Shuuji: Honestly? I kinda doubt it. Tsumugi: I'm sorry. I don't think I'll be able to be of any help since I've just transferred. Shuuji: Don't worry about it. I doubt any of us will be able to do much. Nene: That's right. All we can do anyway is ask everyone we know if they're interested in running. Meguru: Who knows, maybe we'll find someone who'll immediately agree to run when asked. Nene: Yeah, maybe. We shouldn't go into this assuming that we'll fail. Meguru: Alright, let's give this our best starting tomorrow! "

Shuuji: Well, we still have 10 minutes before it's time. She shouldn't be too long... Kawakami: Honestly, I expected you to be dead last, Inaba. Meguru: Mgh. Judging people on appearances is a little rude, you know.  Shuuji: Nah, you're not late or anything. Don't worry about it.  Nene: Sorry... It took me a bit of time to get myself ready... Shuuji: Oh, I see. But hey, the outfit looks great on you. Super cute, Nene. Nene: Th-Thank you... Hehehe. Kawakami: ...Is the difference really that noticeable? I mean, sure, she looks cute like she always does, but I dunno... Meguru: What are you saying? The difference is HUGE. Her hair ends are trimmed, and her cuticles also look perfect. I'd totally bet she's been to a beauty salon.  Kawakami: You serious...? I can't see squat. Heck, like, is it even possible to tell differences in something like trimmed hair ends? Meguru: Actually, popular guys notice these things.  Kawakami: Oh... No wonder Hoshina-senpai did. It's crazy that he's so attentive to detail. Meguru: Hmm... I don't know about that. In his case, I feel like it isn't visual awareness that led to it, but a little thing called \"situational\" awareness.  Shuuji: ...... Meguru: But you better keep in mind, complimenting for the sake of complimenting is a no-no. Kawakami: Ah, okay. Interesting.  Shuuji: ...... Nene: Yes. Kawakami: So where're you gonna be going? Shuuji: Hmm... I like the arcade. Meguru: An arcade for the first place? Very interesting choice. Kawakami: Umm, according to what I've read, arcades aren't a good spot to go on a date... Shuuji: That's just in general. With everything, it really just depends on you and your partner, and your tastes and interests.  Nene: I quite like arcades myself. I've never actually been to one proper, though, so I'm fairly excited for this.  Meguru: Whoa, really?  Nene: I have entered one before, but we were short on time then, so all we did was go to the photo booth. Kawakami: Ohh, okay... Kawakami: So it's the same with dates as it is with shaggin'! Can't go by the books! Shuuji: Yes, but PLEASE don't say that out loud, for Christ's sake!! Meguru: Shaggin? What does that mean? Kawakami: Nah, it's nothing! Just forget I said that, Inaba. Meguru: Hmm. Something smells veeery fishy.  Shuuji: Come on, we're going.  Kawakami: Ah, we're gonna tail you guys from a short distance.  Nene: Oh, you are? I was under the impression we would all stay together... Meguru: Oh no, that'd make things way too awkward for you two.  Kawakami: I wanna know how couples act naturally, is all. If we constantly interrupted y'all with comments and whatnot, that'd pretty much defeat the purpose. Kawakami: Just forget about us two and do your thing. Go on, go on. Shuuji: It's kind of hard to do that when we know we're being watched... Shuuji: No point in dawdling around here forever. Let's go, Nene. Nene: Yes, I'm ready.  Shuuji: If you want, sure. Do you like them? Nene: I do like them, yes... But more so, I thought it would be nice to have some sort of physical object to remember our dates by.  Nene: Do you remember how you suggested we get a cork board before?  Shuuji: So that's what you want... Shuuji: Alright, then! In that case, I'm gonna get you a plushie as a present today. Nene: A plushie? Shuuji: Yep. One from those claw machines. And we can even include it in the picture we take! Nene: Oh, that's a fantastic idea. I'd love that. If you can get one, that'd be wonderful. Shuuji: Almost there, almost there... And, now! Nene: Please don't drop it, please don't drop it... Shuuji: I guess there has to be a way... "

Please don't hesitate to stop by the clubroom again should something else come up. Wakana: Thanks! But I'll be fine. It's just working and earning the money from here on out, after all! Hideaki: ...Umm, may I ask a question? Wakana: Hm? What do you want? Hideaki: What're y'all talking about? And whose clubroom? Wakana: Oh... About that, umm... Do you want me to tell them, Ayachi-san? Nene: I don't mind. As long as you don't thoughtlessly spread it around, you can tell a few people. Hideaki: What's this? Some kind of secret? Nene: Nothing that important. She's talking about me being in the OC.  Shuuji: OC... You mean the Occult Club? Hideaki: Never knew we had a club like that at this school.  Nene: It has been around since before we were here, actually. Though, unfortunately, I'm the only current member.  Hideaki: So with this occult stuff... Are you researching ghosts, or like aliens, or something? Nene: No, I'm doing divination. \"Occult\" encompasses the entire spectrum of the supernatural. Wakana: And she also offers counseling as a bit of a side thing.  Shuuji: So I guess you went and asked for her help on something? Wakana: Yup. Hideaki: Huh. Didn't think someone like you actually worried about things.  Wakana: ...You're the last person I want to hear that from. Wakana: But yeah, it's nothing big really. I just don't have the money to buy something I want. Wakana: And when I went to her for help, she got me this great part-time job.  Nene: You're saving up for a guitar, right? Shuuji: Oh, you can play the guitar? Wakana: I can, actually. Though, I'm not really a pro or anything. Wakana: I found my dad's old guitar a while back, and he's been teaching me ever since. Apparently, he used to be in a band. Wakana: I've been going at it for a few years now, so I've been wanting to get my own, but the one I'm looking at's pretty darn expensive.  Shuuji: And that's why you went to Ayachi-san. I see.  Wakana: Basically, yep.  Hideaki: So you play the guitar, eh? Boy, that sure takes me back. Wakana: Can you play guitar too? Hideaki: If it's just simple chords and crap, yeah. I didn't play the guitar for very long. Nene: Right. You prefer the drums.  Hideaki: ...Huh? Wakana: You play the drums, Kaidou? Shuuji: Seriously? Hideaki: Y-Yeah... I played the drums seriously till about a year ago, during summer. How'd you know that, Ayachi-san? Nene: Ah...! Well, umm... Hideaki: Did you see one of our performances at a club? Wait, no, that can't be it. I definitely would've remembered seeing a pretty girl like you there.  Hideaki: There really weren't a lot of people there... What was it, then? Nene: Well, umm... er, that's... because... m-m-m-m-my divination. I learned that through divination. Hideaki: For frickin' real?! Dang, that stuff is crazy! I always thought it was kinda bogus, to be honest... Never thought you could legit figure out stuff like that.  Wakana: She has a pretty high accuracy rating, or so the girls say.  Shuuji: ...Oh, really? That's neat.  Nene: Umm, if you want to, Hoshina-kun... I could do one for you. Would that be something you're interested in? Wakana, Hideaki: ...... Shuuji: You mean... an actual prediction? Nene: Yes. So, do you want to? Is there maybe something that's been bothering you ever since you were a small child? Shuuji: Nnh―――! Nene: With things like those, it always feels better to talk about it with another person, so if you feel up to it, you're welcome to stop by the clubroom at any time.  Shuuji: ...... Nene: Nothing in particular. I was only proposing a common scenario. There wasn't any deeper meaning to it. Shuuji: Okay, then... Wakana: Did you see something with your divination about him? Nene: You could say so. Nene's Classmate B: Ayachi-saaan! I was gonna ask you something about our math class later on today; could you help me? It's my turn to get called on today. Nene: Ah, sure. Of course. Nene's Classmate B: You're the best! Thanks so much! Nene: Alright then. I'll see you three later.  Wakana: Yeah, bye. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: What can I say... Hideaki: Just make up a problem if you don't got one, sheesh. Just go for the divination so you can spend time alone with her. Man, I can't believe you.  Shuuji: She's helping people out of the kindness of her heart. It just feels wrong to go there with ulterior motives.  Wakana: It's funny you say that, Kaidou, because I didn't see her inviting you. She probably realized how much of a sleazeball you are.  Hideaki: ...Kinda hurts when you say that so bluntly, you know. Shuuji: Ngh―――! Wakana: Hoshina? What're you making that face for? Everything alright?  Shuuji: Ah, yeah. It's nothing.  Hideaki: Yeah, we better.  Wakana: Oh right, there's something I need you guys to do for me. It's about Ayachi-san's club she mentioned.  Shuuji: Ah, didn't she mention she didn't want us spreading it around thoughtlessly? Wakana: Yeah, that's what I was gonna say. Wakana: She's the only one in there, so if word gets out to the whole school, she'll end up swarmed by guys with ulterior motives.   Shuuji: Oh, so guys like Kaidou. Gotcha.  Hideaki: ...Well, I won't deny it. Wakana: So, like I was saying, it'd be a real problem for Ayachi-san if animals like that start barging in her clubroom. Wakana: Plus, like, it'd scare off girls actually wanting to go there for advice, right? So try to keep it to yourself as much as possible.  Hideaki: Sure thing. I won't tell a soul. Hideaki: Means I got an edge over those other guys anyways! Hideaki: Okay, got it. Shuuji: I'll keep my mouth shut too. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: It's no big deal. Girl: Thank you so much. Alright then, good luck♪ Shuuji: See you later.  Hideaki: So you still got roped into doing this, eh? Shuuji: I already said yes, so I can't just change my answer on her now.  Hideaki: Well... I guess that's fair enough. Shuuji: Besides, it's all simple stuff. Don't worry about it.  Hideaki: ...If you say so. But if you ever need me to do something, just hit me up. Wakana: Hoshina, are you sure you don't want any help? Hideaki: Hmm. I guess I can help too, if you want.  Shuuji: I appreciate it, you guys, but I'll really be fine.  Shuuji: You probably have better things to do with your time, anyways.  Wakana: ...Knew you'd say that. Hideaki: You never wanna take help when you get yourself into these situations.  Shuuji: D-Do I? I don't purposely try to... Besides, isn't it only natural for me to not want my friends taking time out of their schedule to help me do something I agreed to? Shuuji: All I'm honestly doing today is entering some data into their database. It's better that I do it alone, if anything.  Shuuji: But, if something like this does happen again, I will come to you guys. Hideaki: You should try not to get into these situations in the first place.  Shuuji: Ah, right. I'll keep that in mind.  Wakana: I'm sure you will. And next time a girl comes up to with something, you'll be too chicken to say no, and then we'll go through this whole thing again. Shuuji: Well, not that I have any problem to come to her with... Shuuji: I've been told to come here and register some new books into the library catalog. Shuuji: Sure.  Committee Girl: Huh? Shuuji: I doubt anyone is gonna come by this late anyway, and I can return the key to the faculty room myself once I'm done. Committee Girl: But... I'm on duty and you aren't even a Committee member... Shuuji: I'm a Library Committee substitute today. It'll be alright. Probably. Committee Girl: You think so? Committee Girl: ...I guess you're right. Okay, here's the key. I'll finish everything else, so just make sure you lock the library once you're done.  Shuuji: Will do. Committee Girl: Could you also turn off the computer before you leave? Shuuji: Oh yeah, of course. I won't forget. Take care on your way home.  Committee Girl: Yeah, thanks! You too. Bye. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Mhh... Now I feel a little bit better. Shuuji: ...That was cringe.  Wakana: \"Hoshina, are you sure you don't want any help?\" Hideaki: \"Hmm. I guess I can help too, if you want. \" Shuuji: They were kind enough to offer... Why didn't I take it? Shuuji: ...If I keep this up, I wouldn't blame them for not wanting to be my friend anymore.  Shuuji: Wait, I can't just bank on something like that happening. I need to put in effort myself. Shuuji: I really need to fundamentally change who I am.  Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: I think I'll come back here on another date. Checking out what kinds of books they have here could be a good way to kill some time.  Nene: I thought this was the right day... Nene: You said you'd fall in love with me... You promised me all I had to do was find you... So why is none of this working out?! Shuuji: Mh... Fuah, aaaaah... Shuuji: Morning. Hideaki: Oh, hey there.  Hideaki: How'd it go yesterday? Shuuji: Pretty swimmingly. I was done with everything before sunset. Akita: Good morning, Hoshina-kun! Shuuji: Oh yeah, hey, Akita-san. Akita: Really sorry about yesterday. I mean, having you fill in for me on such short notice. How'd it go? Shuuji: Great. Finished everything without a hitch, so you're all set. Akita: Wow, really?! Thanks so much! You're the best. Shuuji: Did everything go alright at your thing yesterday? Akita: Yep, you bet! Akita: Ah, right! I baked some cookies as thanks. Here you go! I baked them myself, too! Shuuji: Oh, thanks.  Hideaki: Listen, Akita. I know Shuuji's partly to blame for being such a sucker, but you gotta do these things yourself.  Akita: I know, I know. I apologized to him for it.  Akita: But yesterday really was an important, special day! It was super rare! Like hospital rare! Shuuji: \"Hospital rare\"? Is that your way of saying there was a physician at the mixer? That's pretty impressive. Akita: Ah... Akita: Mixer? What's that? I have no idea what you mean, eheh! Anyway, thanks a lot for yesterday☆ Shuuji: Guess that hospital whatever mixer went great for her.  Hideaki: You could've given her more shit for it, in my opinion... But I didn't like that sarcastic comment you threw in.  Shuuji: I can at least do that. I just hope it teaches her a lesson... But hey, I got some cookies out of it this time, so it's all good. Hideaki: Isn't that just her blatantly showing off, like \"I'm such an amazing, domestic girl☆\"? Shuuji: Doesn't change how happy I was. Hideaki: I can relate. You know they're playing you, but you just can't help but feel glad. Wakana: Morning! Shuuji: Ah, morning. Hideaki: Hey, Wakana-chan. Wakana: What are you guys talking about? Shuuji: The simple-minded nature of men. Wakana: What? Oh, don't tell me... You were talking about naughty topics you don't want a girl to hear about? Hideaki: We guys have our own secrets too. But it wasn't anything sex-related.  Wakana: I don't buy it. Wakana: Hm? What's up? Schoolgirl D: You got someone here to see you! Wakana: Who? Nene: ...... Nene: I need to talk with you about something... Do you have a moment? Wakana: Sure, but what's up? Is it about my part-time job? Nene: No, it's entirely unrelated to that to that... I have a favor I want to ask of you. Wakana: Sure... If it's something I can help you with... Nene: Okay then, umm... Come with me. Wakana: Huh? But the bell's about to― Nene: I promise it won't take long at all.  Shuuji: No idea. Maybe some girls only conversation? Hideaki: Man... That gets me kinda excited. Think it's about a crush? Shuuji: I don't think they're THAT good of friends... Shuuji: Who knows.  Hideaki: What'd she want?  Wakana: Oh, yeah. She just wanted me to relay a message to someone.  Hideaki: Huh? Why would she go to you for that? Wakana: Sorry, I promised not to tell anyone about it. I also can't tell you who the person is.  Hideaki: ...You're just getting me more curious.  Wakana: Oh, look, there's the bell. That means we're done talking here.  Hideaki: Well, shucks. Wakana: Here. For you.  Shuuji: What's this... An envelope? Is there a letter inside? "

            "Nene: Shuuji-kun... Shuuji: Mh... mmh? Shuuji: Mh, mmh... mhh? Nene: Good morning. Shuuji: Are you an angel... Nene: C-Come again...? Am I an angel? Nene: This isn't a dream, silly. Don't go back to sleep on me. It's time to get up. Shuuji: It has to be a dream. No other reason you'd be in my room first thing in the morning... Mmm, I love you, bed. Nene: Stop talking nonsense and get up. We need to get to school.  Shuuji: Mhh... Nene: You're just pretending to be asleep, aren't you? If you don't get up... I won't be happy with you.  Shuuji: Oh... And what are you gonna do...? Nene: I'll forcibly get you up... Mhh *kiss* Shuuji: Mhhh?! Shuuji: N-Nene...? The real Nene? This is real? It's not a dream? Nene: Good morning. Shuuji: M-Morning... B-But why am I... Shuuji: Oh no, you don't have to worry about that.  Shuuji: Besides, it's the guy's job to comfort his girlfriend when she's feeling scared.  Nene: But you had to stay over here because of that... Surely your father wasn't too pleased... Shuuji: Eh, he didn't care. Heck, when I told him I was sleeping over at a friend's place, he was practically jumping for joy. Said he was glad I've been making friends.  Nene: That's relieving.  Shuuji: Oh, heck yeah I would! Thanks for doing this, Nene. Nene: Oh no, it's nothing worth mentioning... Also, I made lunch for us too, so let's eat together later at school. Shuuji: Perfect. I can't wait.  Nene: You do like rice, don't you? Here, I have some for you.  Shuuji: Ah, yeah, thanks. Shuuji: Nope, just savoring this bliss. Waking up to breakfast is a nice feeling.  Shuuji: It's almost like we're married.  Nene: ...... Nene: Th-That might be true... You're going to make me blush if you say that.  Nene: Please help yourself. Shuuji: ...Hm? What're you so giddy over? Nene: And I got to spend the night with you too, so that meant I could watch you as you slept.  Shuuji: ...Stop, you're embarrassing me.  Nene: It made me really happy. I got to see a face of yours I've never seen before.  Shuuji: Is it really that special? Well, I guess it has to be a little different... But hey, do you think I've been acting a little childish around you?  Shuuji: I kinda sat down and thought about it once, and I let you spoil me quite a bit.  Nene: Do you think so? I, um... Didn't really notice that. I thought it was the other way around, really... Nene: Oh, but I can see what you're talking about. You can be quite childish at times.  Shuuji: So you do think so...? Nene: Fueh?! W-Well... umm... I-I'm fine with it. I don't mind it at all. I mean, it did, umm... f-feel good when you... Shuuji: ...What? Nene: Y-You know, wh-when you sucked on my boobs... You were almost like a baby, and I found that really cute... I also enjoyed it, so well... I don't mind you being childish.  Shuuji: THAT'S what you think of when I say childish?! Nene: Nghhh... Gosh! Stop making me talk about these things in the middle of the street! Nene: I'll say it again, okay? I'm totally fine with it. I love everything about you. Your childish side... Your kind, gentle side―everything.  Shuuji: Me too. I love everything about you, from how you can be so cute, to how you can be childish and stubborn.  Shuuji: I also like how dirty you can be.  Nene: Nnh―――! Nene: ...Well, I don't like how much of a meanie-pants you are. If you tease me too much, I won't like you anymore. Shuuji: What...? You won't... like me? Nene: ...... Nene: Urk... Nene: Ngggghhhhhhh...! Shuuji: ...... Nene: D-Don't give me those puppy-dog eyes! I was lying, okay? I didn't mean it! Nene: You know I'd never stop liking you.  Shuuji: Phew. That's a relief.  Nene: ...You're such a meanie, Shuuji-kun. Shuuji: Sorry. But if there's one other thing I love about you, it's you and your cute reactions. Nene: Don't think you can weasel your way out of any situation just by telling me you love me. I'm not that gullible.  Shuuji: Huh? Nene: ...Do you have something to say?  Shuuji: Ah, err... No. Forget it. Tsumugi: Hey there. Nene: Good morning, Inaba-san. Good morning, Shiiba-san. Shuuji: Morning. Meguru, Tsumugi: ...... Nene: I-Is everything okay? You're staring at me rather intently. Do I have bed head or something? Meguru: Oh, hardly. You look absolutely fantastic.  Tsumugi: We're just glad to see you two back together.  Meguru: Everything seems to be back to normal, and we're happy for you two.  Shuuji: Sorry for worrying you. Tsumugi: But man, I am soo relieved.  Nene: I'm very sorry for all the trouble we caused you. But it's alright now. I've decided not to lie to myself any further, so we're going to be back to normal from now on. Meguru: That's perfect. Phew, seriously, I'm so glad. Touko: Ah, hey there, everyone. How's it going? Shuuji: Good morning, Togakushi-senpai. Touko: All good now, huh? Perfect, perfect. That's a load off my mind. Shuuji: Your advice really helped me a lot. So thank you for that.  Touko: It wasn't much of anything special, but if it helped, then I'm glad.  Touko: Fights happen from time to time in relationships, no matter how much you love each other. You just have to not be stubborn about things, and consider what you truly value.  Shuuji: Yeah. I think you're completely right with that. "

            "Guy: What's up? You took on someone else's work again, didn't you? Shuuji: For a Library Committee member, yeah. Apparently, there's something important going on today she can't put off. Guy: Library Committee? Oh... You mean Akita? Guy: She's probably just playing you. There's a reason people call her the \"mixer queen.\" That thing she can't put off is 100\\% just another mixer. She was even talking about the details in the classroom. Shuuji: Oh, a mixer... I see. I suppose that does involve her future, in a way. Guy: Don't tell me you already knew? Shuuji: Kind of. I didn't know what exactly she was doing, but I did have the feeling it wasn't as important as she made it sound. Shuuji: Well, I could have, but... I just figured that I may as well do it if she already has other plans. Guy: Shuuji... Seriously... Hideaki: Want me to tell them no for you? Shuuji: Don't bother. I appreciate the offer, but I'm not a little child; I'm perfectly capable of saying no when I really don't want to do something. Hideaki: ...And yet I've never seen you do so. Shuuji: Well, I don't have much to do after school, anyway. And it's not like people ask me for help every day. Hideaki: But that doesn't mean you should work for these people while they're out having fun. Hideaki: Whatever. How many times have we had this exchange now? I'm sick of telling you this all the time. Shuuji: Sorry. Shuuji: Not really... I don't have any good reason for it. Shuuji: I just figure that being nice to girls could come in handy someday. Hideaki: At this rate, those leeches will suck you dry, dude. Shuuji: I'm obviously not gonna be as lax with my money. Shuuji: It's just... I can't stand that awkwardness you get when turning people down. Anyway, it's different when I have something to do myself, but I don't mind helping when I'm free. Hideaki: ...I swear, you're gonna get scammed real hard at some point, and it'll suck. Girl: Yeah, I can see it now. It's scary just thinking about it. Hideaki: I know, right? You're with me, aren't you, Wakana-chan? Girl: Yeah. It's not normal to accept every single request, if you ask me. You're not hiding something from us, are ya? Shuuji: Err... Wakana: If I had to guess, maybe he's a hardcore masochist? Shuuji: That's a rather extreme assumption. Hideaki: A hardcore masochist?! I see. So you've been taking on all this work in order to get turned on at school... I never would've expected it... Hideaki: You should've told me we were comrades! Shuuji: Keep your fetishes to yourself, dude! You're freaking me out! Wakana: Huh? You mean having girls work you like a dog DOESN'T turn you on? Shuuji: It really stings to see you so genuinely confused by that. Shuuji: And really, girls shouldn't talk about fetishes in the broad daylight. Wakana: What kind of sexist BS is this? Girls are allowed to talk about sex too. Shuuji: Sure, but usually you keep that sort of talk between girls. Shuuji: You got the hots for me or something? Wakana: Hahaha. Nice joke. I know you don't mean that. Hideaki: Though, it is true that girls talking about that stuff can give us guys the wrong idea. Wakana: Well, we only do so around guys we have no interest in. It's just a normal way to make conversation. Don't read too much into it. Shuuji: Either way, I don't get especially happy or anything when people work me. Hideaki: Yeah, sure. Says the guy who takes every request that comes his way. Shuuji: Well... It's just... Shuuji: Won't girls really like me if I never turn them down? Wakana: Ahahahaha! Not at all. If anything, it makes you look like a dumbass. Shuuji: Man, it stings when you say that so bluntly. Hideaki: You need to turn people down every once in a while. You'll get taken advantage of if you let them think you're so soft. Shuuji: You think I'll get taken advantage of...? Now you're just exaggerating. Wakana: I'm not. There are some nasty girls out there who will totally suck you dry with the way you are now. Shuuji: As if. You're clearly overthinking. Wakana: Tch, tch. You're being naive. Women can be much more calculating than you think. Hideaki: They'll make you pay for their food, for movie tickets, and even for accessories like purses! And all they'll give in return is a \"That was a fun way to kill some time. Thanks! See ya♪\" without any progress between the two of you. Hideaki: And then right after that, they'll suddenly call you and ask you to come pick them up because they missed the last train! For freaking real?! There's mischievous and then there's just plain evil! Wakana, Shuuji: ...... Hideaki: Ah?! S-Sorry guys, all my pent-up frustration just kinda exploded there. Shuuji: Looks like you've been through some serious shit, man. Hideaki: Yeah... I used to mess around a lot. But it's all in the past now. Wakana: That sounds like a real nasty girl you ran into. Shuuji: But getting used like that actually made you happy, didn't it? Hideaki: Well... Yeah, a little. Wakana: Ugh, are you grinning?! What a masochist... Terrifying. Shuuji: I seriously don't get how someone can feel pleasure from being treated so crappily. Hideaki: Hehe... That figures. You two are just greenhorns, after all. Shuuji: I'm not planning on ever becoming a masochist veteran. Shuuji: I wouldn't want that... Alright. I'll be more careful from now on. Hideaki: Have you guys forgotten that I'm right here? Hearing that really hurts, you know? Shuuji: I've got a question. Wakana: Go ahead, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: How do I avoid being taken advantage of while coming off as soft? Wakana: Coming off as soft is already a given? Shuuji: I just feel like I'd get on the girls' bad sides if I suddenly changed my whole attitude, which is scary in its own way. Wakana: Well, I guess that's possible. Hideaki: If you want an example of someone who's kind but doesn't get taken advantage of... Wakana: There's Ayachi-san. Hideaki: Oh, right. She's a perfect example. Girl: Yes? You called me? Hideaki: Whoa! A-Ayachi-san?! Ayachi-san: I'm sorry to have startled you. I just so happened to overhear my name when I was passing by. Ayachi-san: Is there something you need with me? Wakana: Oh, uh, don't worry about us. Your name just came up in our conversation. Hideaki: Yeah, we weren't gossiping about you or anything. Shuuji: Sorry if we offended you. Ayachi-san: Oh no, I'm not upset; I was just curious. Please don't mind me. Ayachi-san: Anyway, Kariya-san, about the thing from before... Wakana: Ah! Yeah, it's going great! That place you introduced me to is awesome! Things are going great thanks to you. Thanks so much! Ayachi-san: I'm happy to hear you like it there. Wakana: I'm really thankful to you. Ayachi-san: Please don't hesitate to visit the clubroom again should something else come up. Wakana: Thanks! I will! Schoolgirl B: Ah, Ayachi-saaan! Thanks for letting me borrow your notebook. You were a life-saver. And I have to say, the notes you took were super neat. You're awesome! Ayachi-san: Oh, it was no big deal. More importantly, are you feeling better now? Schoolgirl B: Yeah, I feel great! Ayachi-san: I'm glad to hear that. Is there anything else that is troubling you? Schoolgirl B: No, nothing at the moment. Ayachi-san: I'm willing to help you out or lend an ear to your worries anytime. It doesn't need to be school related; I'm happy to listen to private or other problems too. Schoolgirl B: Thanks. I'll be sure to stop by if something comes up. Ayachi-san: Yes, please do. Shuuji: Huh? Umm... What do you mean? Nene: I'd be glad to help if something should ever concern you. Shuuji: Oh, thanks. I'm happy for the offer, but there's nothing like that right now. Nene: Is that so? For some reason, I got the feeling that there's something worrying you... Shuuji: Y-Yeah...? Shuuji: Yeah...? Nene: No, I haven't... I just had a gut feeling about it. Wakana: Considering how many people you've helped, I think you're right to trust that feeling. Shuuji: What's that supposed to mean? The part about her helping people. Wakana: Oh, whoops... Right... Sorry, Ayachi-san! You're keeping this from the guys, aren't you? Nene: Oh, no, it's not that big of a secret, so don't worry about it. Nene: It would just be a problem for me if people showed up out of curiosity, so I'm asking that you only keep it to people who actually need help. Hideaki: ...? Did we overhear something we shouldn't have? Nene: It's nothing that big... I'm in the OC. Hideaki: OC? Shuuji: Um, you mean... the Occult Club? Nene: Yes. That's right. Shuuji: I didn't know we had one of those at this school. This is the first I'm hearing of it. Hideaki: Same here. And it's not just a circle, but an actual club? Nene: That's right. It's a club that's been around since before we entered this school. Though, I'm currently the only member. Nene: The Student Council has been on our case because of that... After all, the club doesn't do any sort of exhibitions or the like. Hideaki: So... do you research ghosts or something? Or maybe aliens? Nene: No, I am doing divination. \"Occult\" involves the entire spectrum of the supernatural. I am thankfully able to do as I please since I am the only member. Hideaki: By divination you mean, doing hand signs and being like \"And there we have it!\"? Shuuji: It's impressive how old that reference is. I don't think anyone is gonna get that. Wakana: You instantly recognizing it is just as impressive. I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. You guys are such geeks. Right, Ayachi-san? Nene: I obviously can't do Albino Snake Divination. Wakana: You know about it too?! Nene: Yeah, kind of, but I can only do tarot card reading. Divination is nothing more than a hobby for me, after all. Wakana: Anyway, she's also offering counseling there. Nene: It's really just part of the divination I'm doing. It hardly deserves to be called \"counseling.\" Nene: But if you want, don't hesitate to come over to my clubroom anytime, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Oh, sure. Thanks. Schoolgirl A: Ayachi-saaan! I need your help with our classic Japanese homework! Nene: Oh, of course. I'll be right there. Nene: Okay then. I must excuse myself now. Hideaki: She's almost a little too perfect to be real. Hideaki: But anyway, people consult her for a lot of stuff, huh? I would've expected that to turn into a big rumor. Wakana: It's well-known among girls. It'd be a big problem for Ayachi-san if the guys found out and caused a commotion, though. Hideaki: Ah, is that so... Maybe I should pay her a visit too, and then... Ehee! Shuuji: Allow me to read your thoughts: \"Maybe I could get closer to her.\" Hideaki: Huh?! What?! Espers are real? And you're one of them?! Wakana: What're you talking about? You couldn't have been more obvious. You were practically oozing with sleaze. Shuuji: You're even drooling some. Hideaki: Really?! Oh, you're right! Shuuji: I'm guessing that the girls don't spread that rumor around because of how many guys like you there are. Wakana: That's right. You two better keep this to yourselves. Hideaki: Sure. You bet! Shuuji: So anyway, did you also consult her about something, Kariya? I mean, you just thanked her and all. Wakana: I did. I really want something, but I was worried because I didn't have the money for it. Shuuji: What do you want? Wakana: Well... A guitar. Hideaki: A guitar? Sure didn't expect that. Shuuji: You can play the guitar? Well, I guess you wouldn't want one if you couldn't. Wakana: Yeah, a little. Wakana: It's been a few years now, and so I'd like to finally get my own guitar. Shuuji: Huh. My only musical experience comes from music class, though that was ages ago. Hideaki: I could probably play a bit better than Shuuji, then. I had a phase where I was really into music, and so I tried my hand at the guitar. Wakana: Oh, really? That's unexpected. Hideaki: Well, that was a while ago. So? Since you're saving up money, you gonna get a good one? Wakana: Yeah, I'd like a decent one, at least. Though, the prices of musical instruments are pretty crazy. Shuuji: True. Especially vintage instruments. The amount those go for is just bonkers. Wakana: Dad told me to get one with my own money. Would it have killed him to give me at least some of the money for it? Shuuji: So, how did Ayachi-san help you with that? Wakana: She introduced me to a part-time job. Wakana: And now I'm going to finally reach my goal with my next paycheck, meaning I'll be getting my guitar really soon♪ Uhehe. Hideaki: A part-time job, huh? That's nice. Maybe I could have her introduce me to one as well? Wakana: Allow me to read your thoughts: \"Maybe then, I could get closer to her. I could even ask her out on a date to 'repay her' with my first paycheck!\" Hideaki: Is everyone I know a freaking esper?! Shuuji: Look, anyone could guess as much. The fact that she was right just means you're simple. Hideaki: Wh-Whatever! Who cares! Besides, as a guy, I can't let an opportunity to get to know a cute girl like her slip by! Wakana: Well, you have a point... I guess. Shuuji: I'm guessing all the other single guys out there are looking for opportunities too. Student 2: What was it about? I-I want to know... Damn, I'm so jealous of them. Student 3: Damn it... I wanna chat with her too. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Uh... It's nothing. Hideaki: Don't act like this is none of your business. You'd love to get closer with Ayachi-san too, right? Why not get a tarot reading from her? She invited you for one, after all. Shuuji: I dunno... I'll swing by and ask for one once something comes up. Hideaki: What a waste. Wakana: I feel like she wouldn't like it if he went there without a good reason. Hideaki: Huh?! Really? Wakana: Nobody likes a guy who clearly has ulterior motives, you know? Hideaki: Except when you're hot. Wakana: Well, too bad you aren't. Hideaki: Wow! How could you?! Wakana: I don't think girls like Ayachi-san are that shallow. What matters is if you're attractive on the inside, not the outside. Hideaki: I see. Wakana: Besides, people with great personalities wouldn't approach her like that in the first place. Hideaki: Ugh... I guess it's game, set and match for me. Shuuji: Guys, we better head back to class. Afternoon classes are about to start. Wakana: Oh, yeah. Right. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: (Phew...) Shuuji: It's cool. Don't worry about it. Girl: Thanks. Okay then, bye-bye♪ Shuuji: See you tomorrow. Hideaki: So you're still doing this, huh? Shuuji: For today, yeah. It wouldn't be right to turn her down now after I already told her I'd do it. Wakana: Yeah, fair enough. Hideaki: *sigh*... Okay, fine. Want me to give you a hand? Shuuji: Err... Shuuji: I appreciate the sentiment, but no thanks. Hideaki: Knew you'd say that. Wakana: Yeah, it was practically a given. Shuuji: What do you mean? Hideaki: You're a real lone wolf, dude. Shuuji: Okay, look. All I'm doing today is entering some data into their computer database, so I really don't need your help. Shuuji: I'll ask you for help for sure next time something like this happens. Wakana: Stubborn to the end, I see. Hideaki: There's not supposed to be a \"next time.\" You're supposed to turn them down instead. Shuuji: Yeah, yeah. I know. Hideaki: Looks like he's gonna keep on helping people after this. Wakana: That's just how he is. It's not something that can be fixed that easily. Wakana: No point in nagging him about it any further. Hideaki: I'll be on my way, then. What about you, Wakana-chan? Wanna go somewhere if you're free? Wakana: Together with you? Hideaki: Yeah. Wakana: Just the two of us? Hideaki: Yeah! Wakana: Yeah, no way♪ Hideaki: Your blunt replies are too cruel! Wakana: I'm sorry, but I'm busy today. Hideaki: What plans? Wakana: That part-time job. Hideaki: The one Ayachi-san introduced you to? Wakana: Yep. So I don't have time today. Sorry. Hideaki: Work, huh... Well, I guess that's―Huh? Hold on a second. Hideaki: Then why did you ask if it would be the two of us?! Wouldn't that be completely irrelevant?! Wakana: That's just your imagination! Shuuji: If you have school in the day and work in the evening, then doesn't that mean you have no time for homework or studying? Wakana: Yeah, pretty much. I always end up crashing as soon as I come home from work... Wakana: Ugh, our next exams are gonna be rough... Once I get my new guitar, I'm gonna play that bad boy nonstop... Uhehe. Wakana: Oh! I'll be late if I keep standing around chatting like this. See you guys later! Gotta go! Shuuji: See you tomorrow. Hideaki: Don't trip on your shoelaces as you run! Shuuji: Well then, I'll head over to the library now. Hideaki: Yeah, see you. Shuuji: I've been told to come here and register some new books into the library catalog. Committee Girl: Huh? Umm... And you are? I don't remember you being in the Library Committee. Shuuji: I'm filling in for Akita from class 2-A. Apparently, she has something she can't call off and asked me to fill in for her. Committee Girl: Oh, really? If that's how it is... I guess that's alright. Okay, I'm counting on you, then. Shuuji: Sorry, but could you teach me how to do it? Committee Girl: Sure. It's not too hard. Could you sit down at the computer there? Shuuji: Yeah, sure. Committee Girl: So first, you open the database, and then... Okay, there we go. Committee Girl: See the different fields here? Category, title, author, publisher and so on. You have to fill all of them out. Shuuji: I only have to enter the data there and that's it? Committee Girl: Yeah, that's right. Click the register button once they're filled out, and then you'll be back at the main database interface again. Well? Think you can manage? Shuuji: Yeah, probably. Is it okay to ask you if I have any questions later? Committee Girl: Sure thing. Alright, the books you need to register are piled up over here. This is all of them. Shuuji: Got it. Shuuji: Mhm, nnngh... Committee Girl: Umm... You done yet? Shuuji: No, sorry. Shouldn't take much longer, though. Committee Girl: ...Oh. Shuuji: ...... Committee Girl: Huh? Shuuji: I doubt anyone is gonna come by this late anyway, and I can return the key to the faculty room myself once I'm done. Committee Girl: But you aren't on the committee... Shuuji: I've come here to work in place of a Library Committee member. I'm sure me being the one to lock the room up wouldn't be a problem. Committee Girl: You think? Committee Girl: O-Okay then... Could you please handle that for me? Here's the key. Shuuji: Yeah, sure. Committee Girl: Thanks a bunch! I'm off, then! Shuuji: Yeah, bye! Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: ...Hm? Voice: You're kidding me. I came to check up on them since they never came to return the key, and they're nowhere to be seen... I'll need to have a word with them. Girl: Umm, Sensei. Nene: Yes. Time slipped away from me. Sensei: Ah. Well, you shouldn't dawdle around here too much. Nene: Is... there one else here in the library? Sensei: It would seem so. I'm about to lock the room. Nene: I would like you to let me look something up before that. Could you lend me the key? Sensei: You want to look something up this late? Nene: Yes, just something about tarot cards. It won't take much time at all. I'll just need five... no, maybe twenty minutes. Please.  Sensei: ...Well, I suppose I can trust you. Okay, here's the key. Sensei: However, you are to return it to the faculty room within thirty minutes. And make absolutely sure that the room is locked when you leave. Nene: Understood. Thank you very much. Sensei: Alright, goodbye. Nene: Y-Yes... Goodbye... *pant* *pant*... Shuuji: (......?) Shuuji: (...What?) Nene: Ah... ah! Mh... Mhh, mh, mh, mhhh... Shuuji: ...... Nene: Mhh *huff*... *pant* *pant* Ah, aaaah... Fuaaaah... Shuuji: (*gulp*) Nene: No time. I need to hurry, or else... she'll come back... If she sees me doing this... Mhh, mh, mhh, mh! Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah...! Nene: Ah, ah, mhh, mhhh! *pant* *pant* *pant* Ahhh, I'm just the worst! Nene: *paant* *paaant* It feels so good... Ah, ah, aah. So very... good... Mhh! Shuuji: ......

I'm cumming, I'm cumming, I'm cumming, I'm cumming, I'm cumming! Nene: Mhh, mhhhhhhhhhhhh!! Nene: I don't want to move now, but she'll come to check otherwise...

            "Nene: No. You must remember, I live by myself. It's impossible for me to have those experiences with my current life.  Shuuji: But you can't have always lived on your own. Did your family not have any special thing they'd do when someone was sick?  Nene: Well... I guess there was something... Shuuji: What is it? I can do it for you now, if you want.  Nene: What?! That would be quite a few problems with that... plus it would just plain be embarrassing for the both of us. Shuuji: Wait, what?! What kinds of things were your parents doing to you?! Shuuji: What the heck?! That was ten steps beyond the wildest things I was imagining!! Nene: Look, it wasn't anything weird or freakish. It was just a little childish, so it'd be embarrassing to do now... Shuuji: Ah, okay. I see.  Shuuji: Don't worry, I won't laugh. I know you were a kid back then.  Nene: ...I'm sure you won't. Just like how you totally didn't burst out laughing when I told you I ate too much.  Shuuji: Well... I was just super worried, so when you told me it was something as silly as that, it hit me by surprise. Shuuji: I promise I won't laugh this time. You have my word on it. Nene: ......... Shuuji: Eye...? Nene: It's weird, isn't it? I know. It's completely stupid. This is why I didn't want to tell you! Shuuji: Oh no, there's nothing wrong with it.  Shuuji: Now that you've mentioned it, I feel like I've heard that one before as a remedy for stomach aches.  Nene: My memories of it all are still a little fuzzy, but I always remember feeling scared whenever I got sick... then my dad would always come do that to me, and then I would feel better. Nene: I know. It really is silly.  Shuuji: There's nothing wrong with that. I felt scared when I was sick too. Shuuji: I actually felt a lot better after you did that \"pain, pain, go away\" thing for me.  Nene: ...You're determined to embarrass me, aren't you?  Shuuji: I promise I'm not. I'm actually that appreciative of you doing that for me. Nene: And you bringing it back up is what embarrasses me. Seriously... You're brimming with malice. Shuuji: I don't see malice in anything I just said.  Nene: What makes it so bad is your lack of self-awareness.  Shuuji: Do, um... what?  Nene: This time you're going to be the one that does it. Maybe this way you'll finally understand the embarrassment I went through.  Shuuji: Wait... do you want me to do the thing you...? Nene: Sure, you need to experience how embarrassing it feels for yourself. Maybe then you'll stop teasing me so much. Shuuji: ......... Shuuji: ...Just to double-check, you seriously want me to touch your belly?  Nene: Y-Yes, so hurry up and get it over with... It's embarrassing showing you my belly... Plus it's cold.  Shuuji: O-Okay... Then here goes nothing.  Nene: Wh-Why are you sticking your finger into my bellybutton? You use your whole palm to write it, not just one finger! Shuuji: R-Right, I'm so sorry. It just kinda happened. Nene: One, that's not funny. Two, I'm not pregnant. And three, if you don't stop saying those things I'll knock you out.  Shuuji: ...I'm sorry. Shuuji: Okay, let's do this... then... *cough*  Nene: Mhm... mh, uh... mhh, hyan! Shuuji: Y... Nene: Fuu... mh, mhhh... ugh. Shuuji: Umm, are you okay there?  Nene: I'm okay... mhh, haah... It just tickles a little. Nene: I don't remember it ever tickling this bad as a child... But for some reason, now it's... hnng! Shuuji: E... Shuuji: And... S.  Nene: Mhh *pant*... *pant*... Shuuji: Alright, we're all done. Nene: S-So, do you have anything to say? Have you finally learned how embarrassing it is to do these things? Shuuji: Y-Yeah... I guess. Shuuji: N-N-N-N-Nothing, I promise!! How could you suspect me of that, Ayachi-san?! I thought we were friends!!  Nene: If it's nothing then why did you stutter when I asked you? Shuuji: Well, that was just, umm... Oh, wait! I still had the udon cooking! Oh, silly me! Teheehee! Nene: Ah! Hoshina-kun― Shuuji: Alright, go ahead and have some if you feel up to it. If you don't want any, you can just leave it. Nene: Thank you. I feel bad having you go through all this trouble for me... Nene: You've done far too much for me today, really... I'll have to repay you for this sometime. Shuuji: Don't worry about it. I'm only doing it 'cause I want to.  Nene: Still, it wouldn't be right if I didn't do something for you in return. Today won't be possible, naturally... But I'll repay you on some other occasion, I promise.  Shuuji: On some other occasion... Nene: Yes, you have my word on it.  Nene: Ah, one second, Hoshina-kun― Shuuji: Hm? Yeah? Nene: Thank you for the remedy. It, umm... Made me remember some fond times from my childhood. I feel much better now.  Shuuji: Glad to hear, yep.  Shuuji: Well, catch you later.  Nene: Ah! Umm... Shuuji: Need something? Nene: Oh, umm... No, it's nothing. Shuuji: You sure? Nene: Agh, you know what, I do need to ask you something.  Nene: I was curious about earlier, when you said you were having dreams about― Shuuji: Ahhhh crap!! Noooo!! I'm gonna be late for afternoon classes!! I gotta get going right now!! Shuuji: So yeah, bye Ayachi-san! Hope you feel better soon! Nene: Ah, Hoshina-kun! Wai― "

Don't go back to sleep on me. It's time to get up. Shuuji: It has to be a dream. No other reason you'd be in my room first thing in the morning... Mmm, I love you, bed. Nene: Stop talking nonsense and get up. We need to get to school.  Shuuji: Mhh... Nene: You're just pretending to be asleep, aren't you? If you don't get up... I won't be happy with you.  Shuuji: Oh... And what are you gonna do...? Nene: I'll forcibly get you up... Mhh *kiss* Shuuji: Mhhh?! Shuuji: N-Nene...? The real Nene? This is real? It's not a dream? Nene: Good morning. Shuuji: M-Morning... B-But why am I... Shuuji: Oh no, you don't have to worry about that.  Shuuji: Besides, it's the guy's job to comfort his girlfriend when she's feeling scared.  Nene: But you had to stay over here because of that... Surely your father wasn't too pleased... Shuuji: Eh, he didn't care. Heck, when I told him I was sleeping over at a friend's place, he was practically jumping for joy. Said he was glad I've been making friends.  Nene: That's relieving.  Shuuji: Oh, heck yeah I would! Thanks for doing this, Nene. Nene: Oh no, it's nothing worth mentioning... Also, I made lunch for us too, so let's eat together later at school. Shuuji: Perfect. I can't wait.  Nene: You do like rice, don't you? Here, I have some for you.  Shuuji: Ah, yeah, thanks. Shuuji: Nope, just savoring this bliss. Waking up to breakfast is a nice feeling.  Shuuji: It's almost like we're married.  Nene: ...... Nene: Th-That might be true... You're going to make me blush if you say that.  Nene: Please help yourself. Shuuji: ...Hm? What're you so giddy over? Nene: And I got to spend the night with you too, so that meant I could watch you as you slept.  Shuuji: ...Stop, you're embarrassing me.  Nene: It made me really happy. I got to see a face of yours I've never seen before.  Shuuji: Is it really that special? Well, I guess it has to be a little different... But hey, do you think I've been acting a little childish around you?  Shuuji: I kinda sat down and thought about it once, and I let you spoil me quite a bit.  Nene: Do you think so? I, um... Didn't really notice that. I thought it was the other way around, really... Nene: Oh, but I can see what you're talking about. You can be quite childish at times.  Shuuji: So you do think so...? Nene: Fueh?! W-Well... umm... I-I'm fine with it. I don't mind it at all. I mean, it did, umm... f-feel good when you... Shuuji: ...What? Nene: Y-You know, wh-when you sucked on my boobs... You were almost like a baby, and I found that really cute... I also enjoyed it, so well... I don't mind you being childish.  Shuuji: THAT'S what you think of when I say childish?! Nene: Nghhh... Gosh! Stop making me talk about these things in the middle of the street! Nene: I'll say it again, okay? I'm totally fine with it. I love everything about you. Your childish side... Your kind, gentle side―everything.  Shuuji: Me too. I love everything about you, from how you can be so cute, to how you can be childish and stubborn.  Shuuji: I also like how dirty you can be.  Nene: Nnh―――! Nene: ...Well, I don't like how much of a meanie-pants you are. If you tease me too much, I won't like you anymore. Shuuji: What...? You won't... like me? Nene: ...... Nene: Urk... Nene: Ngggghhhhhhh...! Shuuji: ...... Nene: D-Don't give me those puppy-dog eyes! I was lying, okay? I didn't mean it! Nene: You know I'd never stop liking you.  Shuuji: Phew. That's a relief.  Nene: ...You're such a meanie, Shuuji-kun. Shuuji: Sorry. But if there's one other thing I love about you, it's you and your cute reactions. Nene: Don't think you can weasel your way out of any situation just by telling me you love me. I'm not that gullible.  Shuuji: Huh? Nene: ...Do you have something to say?  Shuuji: Ah, err... No. Forget it. Tsumugi: Hey there. Nene: Good morning, Inaba-san. Good morning, Shiiba-san. Shuuji: Morning. Meguru, Tsumugi: ...... Nene: I-Is everything okay? You're staring at me rather intently. Do I have bed head or something? Meguru: Oh, hardly. You look absolutely fantastic.  Tsumugi: We're just glad to see you two back together.  Meguru: Everything seems to be back to normal, and we're happy for you two.  Shuuji: Sorry for worrying you. Tsumugi: But man, I am soo relieved.  Nene: I'm very sorry for all the trouble we caused you. But it's alright now. I've decided not to lie to myself any further, so we're going to be back to normal from now on. Meguru: That's perfect. Phew, seriously, I'm so glad. Touko: Ah, hey there, everyone. How's it going? Shuuji: Good morning, Togakushi-senpai. Touko: All good now, huh? Perfect, perfect. That's a load off my mind. Shuuji: Your advice really helped me a lot. So thank you for that.  Touko: It wasn't much of anything special, but if it helped, then I'm glad.  Touko: Fights happen from time to time in relationships, no matter how much you love each other. You just have to not be stubborn about things, and consider what you truly value.  Shuuji: Yeah.

Guy: Library Committee? Oh... You mean Akita? Guy: She's probably just playing you. There's a reason people call her the \"mixer queen.\" That thing she can't put off is 100\\% just another mixer. She was even talking about the details in the classroom. Shuuji: Oh, a mixer... I see. I suppose that does involve her future, in a way. Guy: Don't tell me you already knew? Shuuji: Kind of. I didn't know what exactly she was doing, but I did have the feeling it wasn't as important as she made it sound. Shuuji: Well, I could have, but... I just figured that I may as well do it if she already has other plans. Guy: Shuuji... Seriously... Hideaki: Want me to tell them no for you? Shuuji: Don't bother. I appreciate the offer, but I'm not a little child; I'm perfectly capable of saying no when I really don't want to do something. Hideaki: ...And yet I've never seen you do so. Shuuji: Well, I don't have much to do after school, anyway. And it's not like people ask me for help every day. Hideaki: But that doesn't mean you should work for these people while they're out having fun. Hideaki: Whatever. How many times have we had this exchange now? I'm sick of telling you this all the time. Shuuji: Sorry. Shuuji: Not really... I don't have any good reason for it. Shuuji: I just figure that being nice to girls could come in handy someday. Hideaki: At this rate, those leeches will suck you dry, dude. Shuuji: I'm obviously not gonna be as lax with my money. Shuuji: It's just... I can't stand that awkwardness you get when turning people down. Anyway, it's different when I have something to do myself, but I don't mind helping when I'm free. Hideaki: ...I swear, you're gonna get scammed real hard at some point, and it'll suck. Girl: Yeah, I can see it now. It's scary just thinking about it. Hideaki: I know, right? You're with me, aren't you, Wakana-chan? Girl: Yeah. It's not normal to accept every single request, if you ask me. You're not hiding something from us, are ya? Shuuji: Err... Wakana: If I had to guess, maybe he's a hardcore masochist? Shuuji: That's a rather extreme assumption. Hideaki: A hardcore masochist?! I see. So you've been taking on all this work in order to get turned on at school... I never would've expected it... Hideaki: You should've told me we were comrades! Shuuji: Keep your fetishes to yourself, dude! You're freaking me out! Wakana: Huh? You mean having girls work you like a dog DOESN'T turn you on? Shuuji: It really stings to see you so genuinely confused by that. Shuuji: And really, girls shouldn't talk about fetishes in the broad daylight. Wakana: What kind of sexist BS is this? Girls are allowed to talk about sex too. Shuuji: Sure, but usually you keep that sort of talk between girls. Shuuji: You got the hots for me or something? Wakana: Hahaha. Nice joke. I know you don't mean that. Hideaki: Though, it is true that girls talking about that stuff can give us guys the wrong idea. Wakana: Well, we only do so around guys we have no interest in. It's just a normal way to make conversation. Don't read too much into it. Shuuji: Either way, I don't get especially happy or anything when people work me. Hideaki: Yeah, sure. Says the guy who takes every request that comes his way. Shuuji: Well... It's just... Shuuji: Won't girls really like me if I never turn them down? Wakana: Ahahahaha! Not at all. If anything, it makes you look like a dumbass. Shuuji: Man, it stings when you say that so bluntly. Hideaki: You need to turn people down every once in a while. You'll get taken advantage of if you let them think you're so soft. Shuuji: You think I'll get taken advantage of...? Now you're just exaggerating. Wakana: I'm not. There are some nasty girls out there who will totally suck you dry with the way you are now. Shuuji: As if. You're clearly overthinking. Wakana: Tch, tch. You're being naive. Women can be much more calculating than you think. Hideaki: They'll make you pay for their food, for movie tickets, and even for accessories like purses! And all they'll give in return is a \"That was a fun way to kill some time. Thanks! See ya♪\" without any progress between the two of you. Hideaki: And then right after that, they'll suddenly call you and ask you to come pick them up because they missed the last train! For freaking real?! There's mischievous and then there's just plain evil! Wakana, Shuuji: ...... Hideaki: Ah?! S-Sorry guys, all my pent-up frustration just kinda exploded there. Shuuji: Looks like you've been through some serious shit, man. Hideaki: Yeah... I used to mess around a lot. But it's all in the past now. Wakana: That sounds like a real nasty girl you ran into. Shuuji: But getting used like that actually made you happy, didn't it? Hideaki: Well... Yeah, a little. Wakana: Ugh, are you grinning?! What a masochist... Terrifying. Shuuji: I seriously don't get how someone can feel pleasure from being treated so crappily. Hideaki: Hehe... That figures. You two are just greenhorns, after all. Shuuji: I'm not planning on ever becoming a masochist veteran. Shuuji: I wouldn't want that... Alright. I'll be more careful from now on. Hideaki: Have you guys forgotten that I'm right here? Hearing that really hurts, you know? Shuuji: I've got a question. Wakana: Go ahead, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: How do I avoid being taken advantage of while coming off as soft? Wakana: Coming off as soft is already a given? Shuuji: I just feel like I'd get on the girls' bad sides if I suddenly changed my whole attitude, which is scary in its own way. Wakana: Well, I guess that's possible. Hideaki: If you want an example of someone who's kind but doesn't get taken advantage of... Wakana: There's Ayachi-san. Hideaki: Oh, right. She's a perfect example. Girl: Yes? You called me? Hideaki: Whoa! A-Ayachi-san?! Ayachi-san: I'm sorry to have startled you. I just so happened to overhear my name when I was passing by. Ayachi-san: Is there something you need with me? Wakana: Oh, uh, don't worry about us. Your name just came up in our conversation. Hideaki: Yeah, we weren't gossiping about you or anything. Shuuji: Sorry if we offended you. Ayachi-san: Oh no, I'm not upset; I was just curious. Please don't mind me. Ayachi-san: Anyway, Kariya-san, about the thing from before... Wakana: Ah! Yeah, it's going great! That place you introduced me to is awesome! Things are going great thanks to you. Thanks so much! Ayachi-san: I'm happy to hear you like it there. Wakana: I'm really thankful to you. Ayachi-san: Please don't hesitate to visit the clubroom again should something else come up. Wakana: Thanks! I will! Schoolgirl B: Ah, Ayachi-saaan! Thanks for letting me borrow your notebook. You were a life-saver. And I have to say, the notes you took were super neat. You're awesome! Ayachi-san: Oh, it was no big deal. More importantly, are you feeling better now? Schoolgirl B: Yeah, I feel great! Ayachi-san: I'm glad to hear that. Is there anything else that is troubling you? Schoolgirl B: No, nothing at the moment. Ayachi-san: I'm willing to help you out or lend an ear to your worries anytime. It doesn't need to be school related; I'm happy to listen to private or other problems too. Schoolgirl B: Thanks. I'll be sure to stop by if something comes up. Ayachi-san: Yes, please do. Shuuji: Huh? Umm... What do you mean? Nene: I'd be glad to help if something should ever concern you. Shuuji: Oh, thanks. I'm happy for the offer, but there's nothing like that right now. Nene: Is that so? For some reason, I got the feeling that there's something worrying you... Shuuji: Y-Yeah...? Shuuji: Yeah...? Nene: No, I haven't... I just had a gut feeling about it. Wakana: Considering how many people you've helped, I think you're right to trust that feeling. Shuuji: What's that supposed to mean? The part about her helping people. Wakana: Oh, whoops... Right... Sorry, Ayachi-san! You're keeping this from the guys, aren't you? Nene: Oh, no, it's not that big of a secret, so don't worry about it. Nene: It would just be a problem for me if people showed up out of curiosity, so I'm asking that you only keep it to people who actually need help. Hideaki: ...? Did we overhear something we shouldn't have? Nene: It's nothing that big... I'm in the OC. Hideaki: OC? Shuuji: Um, you mean... the Occult Club? Nene: Yes. That's right. Shuuji: I didn't know we had one of those at this school. This is the first I'm hearing of it. Hideaki: Same here. And it's not just a circle, but an actual club? Nene: That's right. It's a club that's been around since before we entered this school. Though, I'm currently the only member. Nene: The Student Council has been on our case because of that... After all, the club doesn't do any sort of exhibitions or the like. Hideaki: So... do you research ghosts or something? Or maybe aliens? Nene: No, I am doing divination. \"Occult\" involves the entire spectrum of the supernatural. I am thankfully able to do as I please since I am the only member. Hideaki: By divination you mean, doing hand signs and being like \"And there we have it!\"? Shuuji: It's impressive how old that reference is. I don't think anyone is gonna get that. Wakana: You instantly recognizing it is just as impressive. I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. You guys are such geeks. Right, Ayachi-san? Nene: I obviously can't do Albino Snake Divination. Wakana: You know about it too?! Nene: Yeah, kind of, but I can only do tarot card reading. Divination is nothing more than a hobby for me, after all. Wakana: Anyway, she's also offering counseling there. Nene: It's really just part of the divination I'm doing. It hardly deserves to be called \"counseling.\" Nene: But if you want, don't hesitate to come over to my clubroom anytime, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Oh, sure. Thanks. Schoolgirl A: Ayachi-saaan! I need your help with our classic Japanese homework! Nene: Oh, of course. I'll be right there. Nene: Okay then. I must excuse myself now. Hideaki: She's almost a little too perfect to be real. Hideaki: But anyway, people consult her for a lot of stuff, huh? I would've expected that to turn into a big rumor. Wakana: It's well-known among girls. It'd be a big problem for Ayachi-san if the guys found out and caused a commotion, though. Hideaki: Ah, is that so... Maybe I should pay her a visit too, and then... Ehee! Shuuji: Allow me to read your thoughts: \"Maybe I could get closer to her.\" Hideaki: Huh?! What?! Espers are real? And you're one of them?! Wakana: What're you talking about? You couldn't have been more obvious. You were practically oozing with sleaze. Shuuji: You're even drooling some. Hideaki: Really?! Oh, you're right! Shuuji: I'm guessing that the girls don't spread that rumor around because of how many guys like you there are. Wakana: That's right. You two better keep this to yourselves. Hideaki: Sure. You bet! Shuuji: So anyway, did you also consult her about something, Kariya? I mean, you just thanked her and all. Wakana: I did. I really want something, but I was worried because I didn't have the money for it. Shuuji: What do you want? Wakana: Well... A guitar. Hideaki: A guitar? Sure didn't expect that. Shuuji: You can play the guitar? Well, I guess you wouldn't want one if you couldn't. Wakana: Yeah, a little. Wakana: It's been a few years now, and so I'd like to finally get my own guitar. Shuuji: Huh. My only musical experience comes from music class, though that was ages ago. Hideaki: I could probably play a bit better than Shuuji, then. I had a phase where I was really into music, and so I tried my hand at the guitar. Wakana: Oh, really? That's unexpected. Hideaki: Well, that was a while ago. So? Since you're saving up money, you gonna get a good one? Wakana: Yeah, I'd like a decent one, at least. Though, the prices of musical instruments are pretty crazy. Shuuji: True. Especially vintage instruments. The amount those go for is just bonkers. Wakana: Dad told me to get one with my own money. Would it have killed him to give me at least some of the money for it? Shuuji: So, how did Ayachi-san help you with that? Wakana: She introduced me to a part-time job. Wakana: And now I'm going to finally reach my goal with my next paycheck, meaning I'll be getting my guitar really soon♪ Uhehe. Hideaki: A part-time job, huh? That's nice. Maybe I could have her introduce me to one as well? Wakana: Allow me to read your thoughts: \"Maybe then, I could get closer to her. I could even ask her out on a date to 'repay her' with my first paycheck!\" Hideaki: Is everyone I know a freaking esper?! Shuuji: Look, anyone could guess as much. The fact that she was right just means you're simple. Hideaki: Wh-Whatever! Who cares! Besides, as a guy, I can't let an opportunity to get to know a cute girl like her slip by! Wakana: Well, you have a point... I guess. Shuuji: I'm guessing all the other single guys out there are looking for opportunities too. Student 2: What was it about? I-I want to know... Damn, I'm so jealous of them. Student 3: Damn it... I wanna chat with her too. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Uh... It's nothing. Hideaki: Don't act like this is none of your business. You'd love to get closer with Ayachi-san too, right? Why not get a tarot reading from her? She invited you for one, after all. Shuuji: I dunno... I'll swing by and ask for one once something comes up. Hideaki: What a waste. Wakana: I feel like she wouldn't like it if he went there without a good reason. Hideaki: Huh?! Really? Wakana: Nobody likes a guy who clearly has ulterior motives, you know? Hideaki: Except when you're hot. Wakana: Well, too bad you aren't. Hideaki: Wow! How could you?! Wakana: I don't think girls like Ayachi-san are that shallow. What matters is if you're attractive on the inside, not the outside. Hideaki: I see. Wakana: Besides, people with great personalities wouldn't approach her like that in the first place. Hideaki: Ugh... I guess it's game, set and match for me. Shuuji: Guys, we better head back to class. Afternoon classes are about to start. Wakana: Oh, yeah. Right. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: (Phew...) Shuuji: It's cool. Don't worry about it. Girl: Thanks. Okay then, bye-bye♪ Shuuji: See you tomorrow. Hideaki: So you're still doing this, huh? Shuuji: For today, yeah. It wouldn't be right to turn her down now after I already told her I'd do it. Wakana: Yeah, fair enough. Hideaki: *sigh*... Okay, fine. Want me to give you a hand? Shuuji: Err... Shuuji: I appreciate the sentiment, but no thanks. Hideaki: Knew you'd say that. Wakana: Yeah, it was practically a given. Shuuji: What do you mean? Hideaki: You're a real lone wolf, dude. Shuuji: Okay, look. All I'm doing today is entering some data into their computer database, so I really don't need your help. Shuuji: I'll ask you for help for sure next time something like this happens. Wakana: Stubborn to the end, I see. Hideaki: There's not supposed to be a \"next time.\" You're supposed to turn them down instead. Shuuji: Yeah, yeah. I know. Hideaki: Looks like he's gonna keep on helping people after this. Wakana: That's just how he is. It's not something that can be fixed that easily. Wakana: No point in nagging him about it any further. Hideaki: I'll be on my way, then. What about you, Wakana-chan? Wanna go somewhere if you're free? Wakana: Together with you? Hideaki: Yeah. Wakana: Just the two of us? Hideaki: Yeah! Wakana: Yeah, no way♪ Hideaki: Your blunt replies are too cruel! Wakana: I'm sorry, but I'm busy today. Hideaki: What plans? Wakana: That part-time job. Hideaki: The one Ayachi-san introduced you to? Wakana: Yep. So I don't have time today. Sorry. Hideaki: Work, huh... Well, I guess that's―Huh? Hold on a second. Hideaki: Then why did you ask if it would be the two of us?! Wouldn't that be completely irrelevant?! Wakana: That's just your imagination! Shuuji: If you have school in the day and work in the evening, then doesn't that mean you have no time for homework or studying? Wakana: Yeah, pretty much. I always end up crashing as soon as I come home from work... Wakana: Ugh, our next exams are gonna be rough... Once I get my new guitar, I'm gonna play that bad boy nonstop... Uhehe. Wakana: Oh! I'll be late if I keep standing around chatting like this. See you guys later! Gotta go! Shuuji: See you tomorrow. Hideaki: Don't trip on your shoelaces as you run! Shuuji: Well then, I'll head over to the library now. Hideaki: Yeah, see you. Shuuji: I've been told to come here and register some new books into the library catalog. Committee Girl: Huh? Umm... And you are? I don't remember you being in the Library Committee. Shuuji: I'm filling in for Akita from class 2-A. Apparently, she has something she can't call off and asked me to fill in for her. Committee Girl: Oh, really? If that's how it is... I guess that's alright. Okay, I'm counting on you, then. Shuuji: Sorry, but could you teach me how to do it? Committee Girl: Sure. It's not too hard. Could you sit down at the computer there? Shuuji: Yeah, sure. Committee Girl: So first, you open the database, and then... Okay, there we go. Committee Girl: See the different fields here? Category, title, author, publisher and so on. You have to fill all of them out. Shuuji: I only have to enter the data there and that's it? Committee Girl: Yeah, that's right. Click the register button once they're filled out, and then you'll be back at the main database interface again. Well? Think you can manage? Shuuji: Yeah, probably. Is it okay to ask you if I have any questions later? Committee Girl: Sure thing. Alright, the books you need to register are piled up over here. This is all of them. Shuuji: Got it. Shuuji: Mhm, nnngh... Committee Girl: Umm... You done yet? Shuuji: No, sorry. Shouldn't take much longer, though. Committee Girl: ...Oh. Shuuji: ...... Committee Girl: Huh? Shuuji: I doubt anyone is gonna come by this late anyway, and I can return the key to the faculty room myself once I'm done. Committee Girl: But you aren't on the committee... Shuuji: I've come here to work in place of a Library Committee member. I'm sure me being the one to lock the room up wouldn't be a problem. Committee Girl: You think? Committee Girl: O-Okay then... Could you please handle that for me? Here's the key. Shuuji: Yeah, sure. Committee Girl: Thanks a bunch! I'm off, then! Shuuji: Yeah, bye! Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: ...Hm? Voice: You're kidding me. I came to check up on them since they never came to return the key, and they're nowhere to be seen... I'll need to have a word with them. Girl: Umm, Sensei. Nene: Yes. Time slipped away from me. Sensei: Ah. Well, you shouldn't dawdle around here too much. Nene: Is... there one else here in the library? Sensei: It would seem so. I'm about to lock the room. Nene: I would like you to let me look something up before that. Could you lend me the key? Sensei: You want to look something up this late? Nene: Yes, just something about tarot cards. It won't take much time at all. I'll just need five... no, maybe twenty minutes. Please.  Sensei: ...Well, I suppose I can trust you. Okay, here's the key. Sensei: However, you are to return it to the faculty room within thirty minutes. And make absolutely sure that the room is locked when you leave. Nene: Understood. Thank you very much. Sensei: Alright, goodbye. Nene: Y-Yes... Goodbye... *pant* *pant*... Shuuji: (......?) Shuuji: (...What?) Nene: Ah... ah! Mh... Mhh, mh, mh, mhhh... Shuuji: ...... Nene: Mhh *huff*... *pant* *pant* Ah, aaaah... Fuaaaah... Shuuji: (*gulp*) Nene: No time. I need to hurry, or else... she'll come back... If she sees me doing this... Mhh, mh, mhh, mh! Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah...! Nene: Ah, ah, mhh, mhhh! *pant* *pant* *pant* Ahhh, I'm just the worst! Nene: *paant* *paaant* It feels so good... Ah, ah, aah. So very... good... Mhh! Shuuji: ...... Nene: *pant* *pant* *pant* *paaant*... Ah, ah, ah... ah... Aaaah, mh, mh, mhhh! Nene: Aaaaaah... I can't stop anymore... *slurp*... *pant* *pant*... Aaahhhh! Nene: I want to cum already, I wanna cum... I just want to cum now... *pant* *pant* *pant* Ahh, ah, ah, ah, ah, aaah! Nene: Ah... ah, ah, ah! Ah, ah, ah, aaaaaah! I'm cumming, I'm cumming, I'm cumming, I'm cumming, I'm cumming! Nene: Mhh, mhhhhhhhhhhhh!! Nene: I don't want to move now, but she'll come to check otherwise... I need, to hurry... *pant*... *pant*... But I can't, get any strength, into my body... "

            "Guy: What's up? You took on someone else's work again, didn't you? Shuuji: For a Library Committee member, yeah. Apparently, there's something important going on today she can't put off. Guy: Library Committee? Oh... You mean Akita? Guy: She's probably just playing you. There's a reason people call her the \"mixer queen.\" That thing she can't put off is 100\\% just another mixer. She was even talking about the details in the classroom. Shuuji: Oh, a mixer... I see. I suppose that does involve her future, in a way. Guy: Don't tell me you already knew? Shuuji: Kind of. I didn't know what exactly she was doing, but I did have the feeling it wasn't as important as she made it sound. Shuuji: Well, I could have, but... I just figured that I may as well do it if she already has other plans. Guy: Shuuji... Seriously... Hideaki: Want me to tell them no for you? Shuuji: Don't bother. I appreciate the offer, but I'm not a little child; I'm perfectly capable of saying no when I really don't want to do something. Hideaki: ...And yet I've never seen you do so. Shuuji: Well, I don't have much to do after school, anyway. And it's not like people ask me for help every day. Hideaki: But that doesn't mean you should work for these people while they're out having fun. Hideaki: Whatever. How many times have we had this exchange now? I'm sick of telling you this all the time. Shuuji: Sorry. Shuuji: Not really... I don't have any good reason for it. Shuuji: I just figure that being nice to girls could come in handy someday. Hideaki: At this rate, those leeches will suck you dry, dude. Shuuji: I'm obviously not gonna be as lax with my money. Shuuji: It's just... I can't stand that awkwardness you get when turning people down. Anyway, it's different when I have something to do myself, but I don't mind helping when I'm free. Hideaki: ...I swear, you're gonna get scammed real hard at some point, and it'll suck. Girl: Yeah, I can see it now. It's scary just thinking about it. Hideaki: I know, right? You're with me, aren't you, Wakana-chan? Girl: Yeah. It's not normal to accept every single request, if you ask me. You're not hiding something from us, are ya? Shuuji: Err... Wakana: If I had to guess, maybe he's a hardcore masochist? Shuuji: That's a rather extreme assumption. Hideaki: A hardcore masochist?! I see. So you've been taking on all this work in order to get turned on at school... I never would've expected it... Hideaki: You should've told me we were comrades! Shuuji: Keep your fetishes to yourself, dude! You're freaking me out! Wakana: Huh? You mean having girls work you like a dog DOESN'T turn you on? Shuuji: It really stings to see you so genuinely confused by that. Shuuji: And really, girls shouldn't talk about fetishes in the broad daylight. Wakana: What kind of sexist BS is this? Girls are allowed to talk about sex too. Shuuji: Sure, but usually you keep that sort of talk between girls. Shuuji: You got the hots for me or something? Wakana: Hahaha. Nice joke. I know you don't mean that. Hideaki: Though, it is true that girls talking about that stuff can give us guys the wrong idea. Wakana: Well, we only do so around guys we have no interest in. It's just a normal way to make conversation. Don't read too much into it. Shuuji: Either way, I don't get especially happy or anything when people work me. Hideaki: Yeah, sure. Says the guy who takes every request that comes his way. Shuuji: Well... It's just... Shuuji: Won't girls really like me if I never turn them down? Wakana: Ahahahaha! Not at all. If anything, it makes you look like a dumbass. Shuuji: Man, it stings when you say that so bluntly. Hideaki: You need to turn people down every once in a while. You'll get taken advantage of if you let them think you're so soft. Shuuji: You think I'll get taken advantage of...? Now you're just exaggerating. Wakana: I'm not. There are some nasty girls out there who will totally suck you dry with the way you are now. Shuuji: As if. You're clearly overthinking. Wakana: Tch, tch. You're being naive. Women can be much more calculating than you think. Hideaki: They'll make you pay for their food, for movie tickets, and even for accessories like purses! And all they'll give in return is a \"That was a fun way to kill some time. Thanks! See ya♪\" without any progress between the two of you. Hideaki: And then right after that, they'll suddenly call you and ask you to come pick them up because they missed the last train! For freaking real?! There's mischievous and then there's just plain evil! Wakana, Shuuji: ...... Hideaki: Ah?! S-Sorry guys, all my pent-up frustration just kinda exploded there. Shuuji: Looks like you've been through some serious shit, man. Hideaki: Yeah... I used to mess around a lot. But it's all in the past now. Wakana: That sounds like a real nasty girl you ran into. Shuuji: But getting used like that actually made you happy, didn't it? Hideaki: Well... Yeah, a little. Wakana: Ugh, are you grinning?! What a masochist... Terrifying. Shuuji: I seriously don't get how someone can feel pleasure from being treated so crappily. Hideaki: Hehe... That figures. You two are just greenhorns, after all. Shuuji: I'm not planning on ever becoming a masochist veteran. Shuuji: I wouldn't want that... Alright. I'll be more careful from now on. Hideaki: Have you guys forgotten that I'm right here? Hearing that really hurts, you know? Shuuji: I've got a question. Wakana: Go ahead, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: How do I avoid being taken advantage of while coming off as soft? Wakana: Coming off as soft is already a given? Shuuji: I just feel like I'd get on the girls' bad sides if I suddenly changed my whole attitude, which is scary in its own way. Wakana: Well, I guess that's possible. Hideaki: If you want an example of someone who's kind but doesn't get taken advantage of... Wakana: There's Ayachi-san. Hideaki: Oh, right. She's a perfect example. Girl: Yes? You called me? Hideaki: Whoa! A-Ayachi-san?! Ayachi-san: I'm sorry to have startled you. I just so happened to overhear my name when I was passing by. Ayachi-san: Is there something you need with me? Wakana: Oh, uh, don't worry about us. Your name just came up in our conversation. Hideaki: Yeah, we weren't gossiping about you or anything. Shuuji: Sorry if we offended you. Ayachi-san: Oh no, I'm not upset; I was just curious. Please don't mind me. Ayachi-san: Anyway, Kariya-san, about the thing from before... Wakana: Ah! Yeah, it's going great! That place you introduced me to is awesome! Things are going great thanks to you. Thanks so much! Ayachi-san: I'm happy to hear you like it there. Wakana: I'm really thankful to you. Ayachi-san: Please don't hesitate to visit the clubroom again should something else come up. Wakana: Thanks! I will! Schoolgirl B: Ah, Ayachi-saaan! Thanks for letting me borrow your notebook. You were a life-saver. And I have to say, the notes you took were super neat. You're awesome! Ayachi-san: Oh, it was no big deal. More importantly, are you feeling better now? Schoolgirl B: Yeah, I feel great! Ayachi-san: I'm glad to hear that. Is there anything else that is troubling you? Schoolgirl B: No, nothing at the moment. Ayachi-san: I'm willing to help you out or lend an ear to your worries anytime. It doesn't need to be school related; I'm happy to listen to private or other problems too. Schoolgirl B: Thanks. I'll be sure to stop by if something comes up. Ayachi-san: Yes, please do. Shuuji: Huh? Umm... What do you mean? Nene: I'd be glad to help if something should ever concern you. Shuuji: Oh, thanks. I'm happy for the offer, but there's nothing like that right now. Nene: Is that so? For some reason, I got the feeling that there's something worrying you... Shuuji: Y-Yeah...? Shuuji: Yeah...? Nene: No, I haven't... I just had a gut feeling about it. Wakana: Considering how many people you've helped, I think you're right to trust that feeling. Shuuji: What's that supposed to mean? The part about her helping people. Wakana: Oh, whoops... Right... Sorry, Ayachi-san! You're keeping this from the guys, aren't you? Nene: Oh, no, it's not that big of a secret, so don't worry about it. Nene: It would just be a problem for me if people showed up out of curiosity, so I'm asking that you only keep it to people who actually need help. Hideaki: ...? Did we overhear something we shouldn't have? Nene: It's nothing that big... I'm in the OC. Hideaki: OC? Shuuji: Um, you mean... the Occult Club? Nene: Yes. That's right. Shuuji: I didn't know we had one of those at this school. This is the first I'm hearing of it. Hideaki: Same here. And it's not just a circle, but an actual club? Nene: That's right. It's a club that's been around since before we entered this school. Though, I'm currently the only member. Nene: The Student Council has been on our case because of that... After all, the club doesn't do any sort of exhibitions or the like. Hideaki: So... do you research ghosts or something? Or maybe aliens? Nene: No, I am doing divination. \"Occult\" involves the entire spectrum of the supernatural. I am thankfully able to do as I please since I am the only member.

Nene: I obviously can't do Albino Snake Divination. Wakana: You know about it too?! Nene: Yeah, kind of, but I can only do tarot card reading. Divination is nothing more than a hobby for me, after all. Wakana: Anyway, she's also offering counseling there. Nene: It's really just part of the divination I'm doing. It hardly deserves to be called \"counseling.\" Nene: But if you want, don't hesitate to come over to my clubroom anytime, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Oh, sure. Thanks. Schoolgirl A: Ayachi-saaan! I need your help with our classic Japanese homework! Nene: Oh, of course. I'll be right there. Nene: Okay then. I must excuse myself now. Hideaki: She's almost a little too perfect to be real. Hideaki: But anyway, people consult her for a lot of stuff, huh? I would've expected that to turn into a big rumor. Wakana: It's well-known among girls. It'd be a big problem for Ayachi-san if the guys found out and caused a commotion, though. Hideaki: Ah, is that so... Maybe I should pay her a visit too, and then... Ehee!

Shuuji: I'm guessing that the girls don't spread that rumor around because of how many guys like you there are. Wakana: That's right. You two better keep this to yourselves. Hideaki: Sure. You bet! Shuuji: So anyway, did you also consult her about something, Kariya? I mean, you just thanked her and all. Wakana: I did. I really want something, but I was worried because I didn't have the money for it. Shuuji: What do you want? Wakana: Well... A guitar. Hideaki: A guitar? Sure didn't expect that. Shuuji: You can play the guitar? Well, I guess you wouldn't want one if you couldn't. Wakana: Yeah, a little. Wakana: It's been a few years now, and so I'd like to finally get my own guitar.

Shuuji: So, how did Ayachi-san help you with that? Wakana: She introduced me to a part-time job. Wakana: And now I'm going to finally reach my goal with my next paycheck, meaning I'll be getting my guitar really soon♪ Uhehe. Hideaki: A part-time job, huh? That's nice. Maybe I could have her introduce me to one as well? Wakana: Allow me to read your thoughts: \"Maybe then, I could get closer to her. I could even ask her out on a date to 'repay her' with my first paycheck!\" Hideaki: Is everyone I know a freaking esper?! Shuuji: Look, anyone could guess as much. The fact that she was right just means you're simple. Hideaki: Wh-Whatever! Who cares! Besides, as a guy, I can't let an opportunity to get to know a cute girl like her slip by! Wakana: Well, you have a point... I guess. Shuuji: I'm guessing all the other single guys out there are looking for opportunities too. Student 2: What was it about? I-I want to know... Damn, I'm so jealous of them. Student 3: Damn it... I wanna chat with her too. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Uh... It's nothing. Hideaki: Don't act like this is none of your business. You'd love to get closer with Ayachi-san too, right? Why not get a tarot reading from her? She invited you for one, after all. Shuuji: I dunno... I'll swing by and ask for one once something comes up. Hideaki: What a waste. Wakana: I feel like she wouldn't like it if he went there without a good reason. Hideaki: Huh?! Really? Wakana: Nobody likes a guy who clearly has ulterior motives, you know? Hideaki: Except when you're hot. Wakana: Well, too bad you aren't. Hideaki: Wow! How could you?! Wakana: I don't think girls like Ayachi-san are that shallow. What matters is if you're attractive on the inside, not the outside. Hideaki: I see. Wakana: Besides, people with great personalities wouldn't approach her like that in the first place. Hideaki: Ugh... I guess it's game, set and match for me. Shuuji: Guys, we better head back to class. Afternoon classes are about to start. Wakana: Oh, yeah. Right. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: (Phew...) Shuuji: It's cool. Don't worry about it. Girl: Thanks. Okay then, bye-bye♪ Shuuji: See you tomorrow. Hideaki: So you're still doing this, huh? Shuuji: For today, yeah. It wouldn't be right to turn her down now after I already told her I'd do it. Wakana: Yeah, fair enough. Hideaki: *sigh*... Okay, fine. Want me to give you a hand? Shuuji: Err... Shuuji: I appreciate the sentiment, but no thanks. Hideaki: Knew you'd say that. Wakana: Yeah, it was practically a given. Shuuji: What do you mean? Hideaki: You're a real lone wolf, dude. Shuuji: Okay, look. All I'm doing today is entering some data into their computer database, so I really don't need your help. Shuuji: I'll ask you for help for sure next time something like this happens. Wakana: Stubborn to the end, I see. Hideaki: There's not supposed to be a \"next time.\" You're supposed to turn them down instead. Shuuji: Yeah, yeah. I know. Hideaki: Looks like he's gonna keep on helping people after this. Wakana: That's just how he is. It's not something that can be fixed that easily. Wakana: No point in nagging him about it any further. Hideaki: I'll be on my way, then. What about you, Wakana-chan? Wanna go somewhere if you're free? Wakana: Together with you? Hideaki: Yeah. Wakana: Just the two of us? Hideaki: Yeah! Wakana: Yeah, no way♪ Hideaki: Your blunt replies are too cruel! Wakana: I'm sorry, but I'm busy today. Hideaki: What plans? Wakana: That part-time job. Hideaki: The one Ayachi-san introduced you to? Wakana: Yep. So I don't have time today. Sorry. Hideaki: Work, huh... Well, I guess that's―Huh? Hold on a second. Hideaki: Then why did you ask if it would be the two of us?! Wouldn't that be completely irrelevant?! Wakana: That's just your imagination! Shuuji: If you have school in the day and work in the evening, then doesn't that mean you have no time for homework or studying? Wakana: Yeah, pretty much. I always end up crashing as soon as I come home from work... Wakana: Ugh, our next exams are gonna be rough... Once I get my new guitar, I'm gonna play that bad boy nonstop... Uhehe. Wakana: Oh! I'll be late if I keep standing around chatting like this. See you guys later! Gotta go! Shuuji: See you tomorrow. Hideaki: Don't trip on your shoelaces as you run! Shuuji: Well then, I'll head over to the library now. Hideaki: Yeah, see you. Shuuji: I've been told to come here and register some new books into the library catalog. Committee Girl: Huh? Umm... And you are? I don't remember you being in the Library Committee. Shuuji: I'm filling in for Akita from class 2-A. Apparently, she has something she can't call off and asked me to fill in for her. Committee Girl: Oh, really? If that's how it is... I guess that's alright. Okay, I'm counting on you, then. Shuuji: Sorry, but could you teach me how to do it? Committee Girl: Sure. It's not too hard. Could you sit down at the computer there? Shuuji: Yeah, sure. Committee Girl: So first, you open the database, and then... Okay, there we go. Committee Girl: See the different fields here? Category, title, author, publisher and so on. You have to fill all of them out. Shuuji: I only have to enter the data there and that's it? Committee Girl: Yeah, that's right. Click the register button once they're filled out, and then you'll be back at the main database interface again. Well? Think you can manage? Shuuji: Yeah, probably. Is it okay to ask you if I have any questions later? Committee Girl: Sure thing. Alright, the books you need to register are piled up over here. This is all of them. Shuuji: Got it. Shuuji: Mhm, nnngh... Committee Girl: Umm... You done yet? Shuuji: No, sorry. Shouldn't take much longer, though. Committee Girl: ...Oh. Shuuji: ...... Committee Girl: Huh? Shuuji: I doubt anyone is gonna come by this late anyway, and I can return the key to the faculty room myself once I'm done. Committee Girl: But you aren't on the committee... Shuuji: I've come here to work in place of a Library Committee member. I'm sure me being the one to lock the room up wouldn't be a problem. Committee Girl: You think? Committee Girl: O-Okay then... Could you please handle that for me? Here's the key. Shuuji: Yeah, sure. Committee Girl: Thanks a bunch! I'm off, then! Shuuji: Yeah, bye! Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: ...Hm? Voice: You're kidding me. I came to check up on them since they never came to return the key, and they're nowhere to be seen... I'll need to have a word with them. Girl: Umm, Sensei. Nene: Yes. Time slipped away from me. Sensei: Ah. Well, you shouldn't dawdle around here too much. Nene: Is... there one else here in the library? Sensei: It would seem so. I'm about to lock the room. Nene: I would like you to let me look something up before that. Could you lend me the key? Sensei: You want to look something up this late? Nene: Yes, just something about tarot cards. It won't take much time at all. I'll just need five... no, maybe twenty minutes. Please.  Sensei: ...Well, I suppose I can trust you. Okay, here's the key. Sensei: However, you are to return it to the faculty room within thirty minutes. And make absolutely sure that the room is locked when you leave. Nene: Understood. Thank you very much. Sensei: Alright, goodbye. Nene: Y-Yes... Goodbye... *pant* *pant*... Shuuji: (......?) Shuuji: (...What?) Nene: Ah... ah! Mh... Mhh, mh, mh, mhhh... Shuuji: ...... Nene: Mhh *huff*... *pant* *pant* Ah, aaaah... Fuaaaah... Shuuji: (*gulp*) Nene: No time. I need to hurry, or else... she'll come back... If she sees me doing this... Mhh, mh, mhh, mh! Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah...! Nene: Ah, ah, mhh, mhhh! *pant* *pant* *pant* Ahhh, I'm just the worst! Nene: *paant* *paaant* It feels so good... Ah, ah, aah. So very... good... Mhh! Shuuji: ...... Nene: *pant* *pant* *pant* *paaant*... Ah, ah, ah... ah... Aaaah, mh, mh, mhhh! Nene: Aaaaaah... I can't stop anymore... *slurp*... *pant* *pant*... Aaahhhh! Nene: I want to cum already, I wanna cum... I just want to cum now... *pant* *pant* *pant* Ahh, ah, ah, ah, ah, aaah! Nene: Ah... ah, ah, ah! Ah, ah, ah, aaaaaah! I'm cumming, I'm cumming, I'm cumming, I'm cumming, I'm cumming! Nene: Mhh, mhhhhhhhhhhhh!! Nene: I don't want to move now, but she'll come to check otherwise... I need, to hurry... *pant*... *pant*... But I can't, get any strength, into my body... "

            "Nene: Not every day is active here. Tsumugi: It's getting kind of late, so maybe we should all head home. Nene: Good idea. Meguru: Nene-senpai, Tsumugi-senpai, let's go home together. Tsumugi: Yeah, sounds good. Nene: Okay, if you don't mind me parting ways soon after leaving. Meguru: Of course not. Well then... Tsumugi: We should tidy up before heading home. Nene: You two can leave before us if you like. Shuuji: No, we can't do that. Touko: He's right. We can't just leave early because we're dating. It wouldn't be right. Nene: Don't worry about us, please. All we really have to do is make sure everything's locked up. Tsumugi: You two have plans anyway, don't you? Shuuji: Wh-Why would you... Meguru: Well, you've been restless this whole time, Senpai. You've just been spacing out and glancing at the clock over and over again. You're so easy to read. Nene: Even I could tell. Shuuji: Gah... Touko: Ah... You could tell? Tsumugi: Yes. You were murmuring to yourself too, but I couldn't make it out. Touko: I didn't mean to... but I guess I did. Sorry about that. Nene: No, don't worry about it today. Nobody came to ask for our help, or even to have their fortune told. Meguru: Actually, having the two of you here sometimes makes the rest of us uncomfortable. Meguru: So please just go on your date or whatever and get out of our hair. That's the only the help we need. Touko: Yeah, sounds good to me. Touko: Sorry, everyone, but we're taking off now. Nene: Okay, see you later. Tsumugi: Bye-bye. Meguru: See ya Monday. Shuuji: Bye! Shuuji: Yeah. But they're just trying to look out for us, so we shouldn't worry about it. Shuuji: We'll just have to be careful not to let this happen again. Touko: Yeah, you're right. Let's save the worrying for later and have a wonderful time together tonight. Shuuji: Y-Yeah?! Shuuji: N-No, nothing at all. Touko: Really? Well, okay then... Oh, right. What should I make today, Hoshina-kun? I've been thinking about it all day, but I haven't come up with anything. Shuuji: Is that what you were thinking about in the club room? Touko: Yeah. Is there anything you'd like to eat? Shuuji: Let's see... Touko: Is that what you want? I'm fine with it, but... Shuuji: Yeah. I barely ever make it myself. Touko: Really? Shuuji: I normally just combine chicken and eggs with rice and put it in a bowl. I'd like to taste your omelet rice. Touko: I see. Okay then. I'm happy to make that for you. Omelet rice for dinner, it is! Shuuji: Great, thanks. Touko: But doesn't saying \"I'd like to taste your omelet\" sound kinda indecent to you? That's a total double entendre. Shuuji: No? There's no way that could be! Touko: Huh, really? Maybe I was overthinking it... Hmm... Touko: Yeah, we do. Oh, that reminds me. What about your dad? Shuuji: My dad says he'll be working late today and will eat out, so you don't have to worry about him. Touko: Okay, okay. Then what we need is... Shuuji: Yup, and we have some butter left over too. Touko: Do you prefer your eggs firm or a little runny? Shuuji: I'm fine with either. Today I just want to eat the kind of food you'd make for yourself. Touko: Okay, so a little runny it is. Which means... We'll need to buy some fresh cream. Touko: Dear, oh dear... Touko: It's fine, I'll do it. This is just part of making dinner. You go and get changed. Shuuji: But, Senpai― Touko: There's no point in you standing around here in your uniform. You'll be more comfortable after you've changed and it'll make the food taste even better. Shuuji: How would my clothes change the taste of the food? Touko: You have much to learn. The condition a person is in affects how good food tastes, you know? Like, food doesn't taste as good when you're sick, does it? Shuuji: Well, yeah, but you're sick... Touko: I'm the one making this and I want it to be perfect. Now, go get changed and I'll clean things up here. Shuuji: ...Okay, I'm sorry. I'll go and get changed now. Touko: Great. Go ahead and take your time. And don't worry, I won't peep. Mufufu. Shuuji: You saying that only makes me more worried. Touko: Mine's in my bag. Hoshina-kun's should be... Oh, there's his bag. I'm sure he won't mind if I... Shuuji: ...Done. Touko: Hoshina-kun, we need to talk. Please sit right here. Shuuji: Here? Touko: ...Please sit with me. Shuuji: ...Okay. Touko: There's something I have to apologize to you for. Shuuji: Huh? Surely, I should be the one apologizing for leaving you here alone in my kitchen. What's there for you to apologize about? Touko: While I was washing the frying pans earlier, I thought I should also wash our lunch boxes. So I went through your bag without permission. I'm sorry. Shuuji: Oh, you didn't have to do that... I could have at least washed the lunch boxes. Shuuji: And I don't think you need to sit me down and apologize for opening my bag... Shuuji: %130;...Wait, you opened my bag?! Shuuji: *gulp* Touko: While I do apologize for going through your bag without permission, this is what I found inside it. Shuuji: ...... Touko: Did you plan on watching it? I assume that's why you have it. Shuuji: Oh, no... Well, I mean... Touko: Alone, after I'd gone home? Shuuji: ...That's right. Touko: Hoshina-kun! Shuuji: Y-Yes ma'am! Touko: Why would you do that?! Shuuji: Well, errm, I am a guy, and, as embarrassing as it is... when I'm alone, I do have certain urges that must be dealt with... Touko: I don't care about you masturbating! Touko: Why were you going to watch this alone?! Shuuji: ...Huh? I mean, uh... Touko: We promised to study together! Why wouldn't you ask me to join you?! Shuuji: ...... Touko: Huh? Why would I be? It's normal for guys to have, isn't it? Touko: I don't mind that one bit. It's not like this is one of those disgusting loli ones. Shuuji: Then... what are you angry about? Touko: As I said, it's because you were trying to leave me out and watch this alone! Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Huh? R-Right, we did. We sure did promise that. Touko: But you were planning to watch this naughty video alone, weren't you? Wouldn't getting some extra studying in on your own go against our promise? Shuuji: Y-Yeah... I guess you could see it like that? Touko: I'm right, aren't I? You were planning on watching this alone to get in some secret studying. Touko: Even though you know how much I want to study this subject... That's not fair! Shuuji: What's not fair?! Shuuji: I wasn't trying to break our promise here! Touko: Really? Shuuji: Really. I mean it. Touko: *stare* Shuuji: I'm serious. Touko: You weren't planning on studying alone? Shuuji: No. You've misunderstood. Touko: Shall we watch this DVD together? Shuuji: What?! Wh-Why would we do that?! Touko: If we watch it together, you'll get to watch it, and you won't have to break our promise. It's a win-win situation. The perfect idea! Shuuji: Why are you smiling so much?! Touko: Huh? Are you saying we can't? Shuuji: It's more like... I'm not that into shame-play like that... Touko: I'm not saying this as a joke, you know? Shuuji: Yeah? And? Touko: Well... You know, most manga show up to the kiss, which is also all that movie the other day went up to, right? Shuuji: Well, yeah. Shuuji: Yeah... You have a point, I guess... Touko: But I've never actually seen it. Oh, though I have seen a girl's genitals, since I have them and all. Shuuji: Umm... You don't have to be quite so descriptive. Touko: You don't have any experience with this either, do you? Shuuji: ...N-No, I don't. Touko: Well, it's at times like this the older girl has to take the lead. This is something I've been worrying about a lot, lately. Touko: But I've hit a dead end. If you'd just showed me the DVD... In fact, if I'd just been honest with you in the first place, we could have already studied it together. Touko: So, basically, let's watch this porno together! Shuuji: Please don't say that while smiling so innocently. AV: Ah, mm! Ah, ah, ah, ahh! Yes, your cock is amazing! Haa, haa, haa, nnn! Touko: Ooh... So this is sex... This is something else. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Huh? Oh, err, I dunno, really? I've only seen videos of it... Shuuji: I think it depends on the person... They probably exaggerate it a bit for porn. Touko: I see... This is acting... Is that face she's making acting too? Touko: It's rather incredible... Is this what they call an o-face? Shuuji: %130;Pffffffft! Touko: It isn't? I don't really know the details, but don't you have to make that face the whole time you're having sex? Isn't that just common courtesy? Touko: I wonder if it's like this. Shuuji: Whoa, you don't have to do it! You really don't have to do it! Touko: Huh, really? Shuuji: That face is one you're meant to make naturally at, like, a special moment. You don't need to worry about it. Touko: Really? I don't? Phew, that's a relief. I was worried about getting the face wrong and you hating me for it. Shuuji: There are way more important things to worry about! Touko: So, when are you meant to do the double peace signs? The girl here hasn't done that at all yet. Shuuji: Nobody ever does that, either! Touko: Then I don't have to do it? Shuuji: No! You don't! Shuuji: No, I'm pretty sure there's more... Touko: Ah, you're right. Next is... Whoa, in between the boobs? Is this what they a call boobjob? Shuuji: I-It is... Touko: Well... Not really, no. This is for a special reason, and I wanted to do it. What about you, Hoshina-kun? Are you embarrassed? Shuuji: Incredibly! I was against us watching this together from the start! Touko: Oh yeah. Why don't you want to do this? Shuuji: Because this is something you're meant to enjoy in private... Like, without other people knowing. Shuuji: It's really uncomfortable to watch this with someone else. I can't settle down. Touko: You can't settle down? Oh... Does that mean you're struggling to hold yourself back? Well, don't mind me. Feel free to do as you normally would. Shuuji: %130;Like hell I can do that! Shuuji: I'm not into masturbating in front of people. Especially not you, Senpai! Touko: Really? Shuuji: ...But you're still planning on watching the video to learn more, aren't you? Touko: Actually, I only have more questions after watching this. Shuuji: Such as? Touko: Do boobjobs feel good? Shuuji: I-I dunno. I couldn't say. I've never gotten one before... Touko: But guys really want them, right? So then, Hoshina-kun... do you also want one? Shuuji: Oh, well... I suppose I'd like to experience one someday. Shuuji: ...... Touko: Would you like to try it out? Shuuji: Huh? Touko: Would you like to try it out... with my boobs? Shuuji: Senpai?! Touko: Mm... *kiss* *kiss* *kiss* Mmpah, mm, mmmph! Shuuji: Can I take your shirt off, Senpai? Touko: Ah, okay... Shuuji: Could you raise your arms up for me? Touko: Mm... Shuuji: I'm nervous thinking about what's coming up too. Touko: You're staring so much. It's so embarrassing, ahaha... Shuuji: So beautiful... Touko: Are you talking about my bra? Or my boobs? Shuuji: Everything. Your bra, your boobs, your fair skin... it's all beautiful. I don't know what to say. I wish I could stare at them forever. Touko: Oh, thanks... But we'll never get anywhere if you only ever stare at them. Shuuji: Y-You're right. Th-Then... excuse me. Shuuji: Oh, sorry. I'll stop. Touko: You do? That's great. Shuuji: W-Well then... I'm taking off your bra. Touko: Okay... Mm, mmm... Th-This kind of tickles. Shuuji: Sorry. This will just take a moment... Shuuji: Oh, no, it's fine. Touko: Do you prefer doing it with clothes on? You big pervert, you. Mufufu. Touko: Yeah. But please be gentle. Shuuji: I-I will. Of course. Touko: Mm, ah... I'm nervous too. A boy is fondling my breasts for the first time... Touko: I-Is everything okay? My boobs aren't weird, are they? Shuuji: Not even a little. They're so big and soft. I don't know if I'll be able to stop fondling them. I love your boobs, Senpai. Touko: Ahn, mm... J-Just my boobs? *pant* *pant* Mmm! Shuuji: Allow me to rephrase. I love everything about you, Senpai. You're so cute. There's nothing weird about any part of you. Shuuji: Sorry, but I can't hold back. Shuuji: That's fine. The woman in the porno did it too. Touko: Mm, she did, but... Hearing them come from me is so embarrassing that I can hardly stand it.  Shuuji: Oh, is that so? Shuuji: Your nipples are getting harder, Senpai. That's not because you're cold, is it? Touko: Nnahh, nn, nnngh... N-No. My chest feels like it's on fire. *pant* *pant* Shuuji: I don't know what you're talking about. Shuuji: I'm really not meaning to! You're just so cute and your boobs are so amazing that I'm getting carried away a little. Touko: Sheesh. That's enough fondling of my boobs. Shuuji: Huh?! What?! Touko: Weren't we going to do something a little different? Shuuji: Well... Yeah, true. Touko: Then we should get to it. Are you all ready? Shuuji: It's embarrassing but... Yeah, of course. AV: Ahh, mm... Ahh! Ahh! Your dick milk ish sho hot... It's shooting out all over! Touko: I see, so that's how you do it. Then... I'll lie down, and you get on top of me. And then... you bring your dick out. Shuuji: ......! Touko: So this is your dick... Shuuji: Yeah, I was just thinking the same thing. Touko: And the tip of your dick is wet. Is this dick milk? Shuuji: Errm, you don't have to mimic that bit. Just refer to it normally, please? Touko: Should I? Okay, so, is this sticky stuff semen? Oh look, it's making threads. Shuuji: No, it isn't. That's, um... precum, or cowper's fluid. Just call it one of those. Touko: Ah, I know about that. This juice comes out when you're feeling good, but before you release, right? Hmm, this is... ah, it's transparent. Touko: Mm, mmm... This juice is so sticky. Ah, it's making more threads. This is getting even more indecent. Mufufu. Shuuji: Your boobs just feel that good. Ah, ah, nnngh! Touko: Really? Hehe, I'm glad... Having big boobs can be a real pain sometimes, but that pain is all worth it if you like them. I'll let you enjoy them even more. Mm, mmm, nngh... Touko: Mufufu, see? Isn't moaning embarrassing? Ah, mm, ahh, nngh! Shuuji: Y-Yeah, it is. G... Go a bit slower, Senpai. Touko: Nope. I'm going to give your dick all the love my boobs can give. Shuuji: Ngh, aaah! Shuuji: Ah, ah... Y-You're being so rough! Touko: Hey, look, your dick is getting so red between my boobs. And it's twitching too... It's so cute. Shuuji: H-Hold on, Senpai. You can't do that! It's... dirty! Touko: I don't mind. It's not dirty at all. It's adorable. *kiss* Shuuji: Nh?! Touko: I'll get as dirty as I want for you. That's normal when, mm, mmpah, you like someone... Mm. *kiss* *kiss* *kiss* Shuuji: B-But... If you kiss it like that... Touko: *kiss* *kiss* It feels good, doesn't it? Ah, are you at your limit already? Shuuji: Y-Yeah... This is bad... I'm really trying to hold back here. Shuuji: Ahh, S-Senpai, h-hold on! If you keep moving like that, then...! I said I'm gonna cum! Touko: So cum, then. Look, the guy in the video is cumming right now. Shuuji: P-Probably. Though, the white and sticky part is normal. Touko: Oh, okay... Go ahead and cum. Shoot out loads of semen. Do it just like in the video. Come on; do it. Touko: Mufufu... You say that, but you seem to be really enjoying yourself. Mm, ahh, mm, nnn... Shuuji: But one wrong move and I'll cum on the spot. Touko: Hey, aren't you going to cum? Let out all of your sticky stuff. Shuuji: Senpai, I-I... Aah! Touko: Are you cumming? Are you releasing your semen? It's okay; go ahead. Do it just like in the video. Shuuji: I-I'm gonna cum. Touko: Yeah... Hurry up and cum... Ah, ah, ah... Touko: Haah, ahh... Come on... Cum in my mouth. You can do it as much as you want, whenever you want. Ah, ahh, ahh... Haah, haah! Shuuji: Senpai! Senpai! I'm cumming! Touko: Good. Cum, and cover my face and boobs in your naughty, sticky juice. Let out all your semen... *pant* *pant* *pant* Shuuji: S-Senpai! Touko: Nhaaaah?! Touko: Mmmrph! Nngh, mmm! *gulp* Pwah! Haa, haa, mm... *pant* *pant* Touko: *kiss* *kiss* Mmm, you really did cum too much... *pant* *pant* It's like I'm drowning in semen. *pant* *pant* *kiss* Shuuji: You don't have to force yourself to drink this. Touko: The only problem is how much there is. Mm. *slurp* I like you, and I like your cum too... *lick* *gulp* *gulp* Mmmm, mpwah! Touko: Y-You will? Can you shoot again so quickly? Shuuji: Not normally, but you're just too damn sexy right now... I can't calm down. Touko: Yeah? So it's my fault. Then... I'll have to take responsibility... Mmm... *kiss* *suck* *lick* Ahh... Shuuji: S-Senpai?! Touko: It's okay. We can do this as much as you want. I like it and want to do it. I really want to keep going. So... can we? Let out another load for me. Touko: And you're really cute, Hoshina-kun. Omm! *lick* *kiss* *kiss* And you're cute down here too... *lick* *slurp*! Shuuji: Ah, ah... S-Senpai, there... Touko: Mmm, here? It's all wet again, mm... *kiss* *kiss* *slurp* Touko: Ehehe... So much naughty juice... Mmm... It's tasty. Mmph, mmm... Shuuji: Ngh, aahh! Touko: Ahh, mm, mmpah... *lick* *lick* Mmpah... Your voice is trembling. Shuuji: Your... boobs and tongue feel too good. I'm going numb. Touko: *slurp* Mmpah, ahh... *kiss* *kiss* Ahh, mmm... *lick* *lick* Mmm, your dick is trembling too. Are you about to cum again? Shuuji: Y-Yeah... I can't last much longer. Touko: Mm, okay, cum again. I'll accept it all... Mm, mmm! *kiss* *kiss* Mmpah, ahh... Come on, don't hold back. Cum! Touko: Ahh, omm... *kiss* *kiss* *slurp* Mm, mm, mm... *kiss* *slurrrp*! Mmpah, mmhaah! Touko: Are you cumming again? This is faster than the last time. *lick* Mm, mmpah, mmmph! Shuuji: It's because you haven't stopped giving me a boobjob this whole time... Ngh. Touko: Mufufu. You don't have to hold back. Cover me in your hot stuff again. *lick* *lick* *kiss* Shuuji: I will. I'm going to coat your entire face, Senpai, and prove that you belong to me. Touko: Mm, mmph, mmpah! I'm sho happy... Yesh, cover me, make me shticky, drown me in your semen! Touko: Yes, good. Cover me, cover me! *lick* *lick* Nnnhaah! Mm, mmpah, mmph... *kiss* *kiss* Shuuji: Ah, ah! I-I'm cumming! Touko: Mmm, mmgh, mmhaaaaaah! Touko: The smell is so strong, and there's so much... *gulp* *gulp* Nhaah... I love semen... *pant* *pant* Shuuji: I really made a mess of your face, Senpai... I'm sorry. Touko: You don't have to apologize. I wanted this... I'm happy you came so much. Touko: Omm! *slurp* *lick* Mmpah... *gulp* *gulp* Mm, mmph... *pant* *pant* It really is tasty. Shuuji: ...... "

            "Guy: What's up? You took on someone else's work again, didn't you? Shuuji: For a Library Committee member, yeah. Apparently, there's something important going on today she can't put off. Guy: Library Committee? Oh... You mean Akita? Guy: She's probably just playing you. There's a reason people call her the \"mixer queen.\" That thing she can't put off is 100\\% just another mixer. She was even talking about the details in the classroom. Shuuji: Oh, a mixer... I see. I suppose that does involve her future, in a way. Guy: Don't tell me you already knew? Shuuji: Kind of. I didn't know what exactly she was doing, but I did have the feeling it wasn't as important as she made it sound. Shuuji: Well, I could have, but... I just figured that I may as well do it if she already has other plans. Guy: Shuuji... Seriously... Hideaki: Want me to tell them no for you? Shuuji: Don't bother. I appreciate the offer, but I'm not a little child; I'm perfectly capable of saying no when I really don't want to do something. Hideaki: ...And yet I've never seen you do so. Shuuji: Well, I don't have much to do after school, anyway. And it's not like people ask me for help every day. Hideaki: But that doesn't mean you should work for these people while they're out having fun. Hideaki: Whatever. How many times have we had this exchange now? I'm sick of telling you this all the time. Shuuji: Sorry. Shuuji: Not really... I don't have any good reason for it. Shuuji: I just figure that being nice to girls could come in handy someday. Hideaki: At this rate, those leeches will suck you dry, dude. Shuuji: I'm obviously not gonna be as lax with my money. Shuuji: It's just... I can't stand that awkwardness you get when turning people down. Anyway, it's different when I have something to do myself, but I don't mind helping when I'm free. Hideaki: ...I swear, you're gonna get scammed real hard at some point, and it'll suck. Girl: Yeah, I can see it now. It's scary just thinking about it. Hideaki: I know, right? You're with me, aren't you, Wakana-chan? Girl: Yeah. It's not normal to accept every single request, if you ask me. You're not hiding something from us, are ya? Shuuji: Err... Wakana: If I had to guess, maybe he's a hardcore masochist? Shuuji: That's a rather extreme assumption. Hideaki: A hardcore masochist?! I see. So you've been taking on all this work in order to get turned on at school... I never would've expected it... Hideaki: You should've told me we were comrades! Shuuji: Keep your fetishes to yourself, dude! You're freaking me out! Wakana: Huh? You mean having girls work you like a dog DOESN'T turn you on? Shuuji: It really stings to see you so genuinely confused by that. Shuuji: And really, girls shouldn't talk about fetishes in the broad daylight. Wakana: What kind of sexist BS is this? Girls are allowed to talk about sex too. Shuuji: Sure, but usually you keep that sort of talk between girls. Shuuji: You got the hots for me or something? Wakana: Hahaha. Nice joke. I know you don't mean that. Hideaki: Though, it is true that girls talking about that stuff can give us guys the wrong idea. Wakana: Well, we only do so around guys we have no interest in. It's just a normal way to make conversation. Don't read too much into it. Shuuji: Either way, I don't get especially happy or anything when people work me. Hideaki: Yeah, sure. Says the guy who takes every request that comes his way. Shuuji: Well... It's just... Shuuji: Won't girls really like me if I never turn them down? Wakana: Ahahahaha! Not at all. If anything, it makes you look like a dumbass. Shuuji: Man, it stings when you say that so bluntly. Hideaki: You need to turn people down every once in a while. You'll get taken advantage of if you let them think you're so soft. Shuuji: You think I'll get taken advantage of...? Now you're just exaggerating. Wakana: I'm not. There are some nasty girls out there who will totally suck you dry with the way you are now. Shuuji: As if. You're clearly overthinking. Wakana: Tch, tch. You're being naive. Women can be much more calculating than you think. Hideaki: They'll make you pay for their food, for movie tickets, and even for accessories like purses! And all they'll give in return is a \"That was a fun way to kill some time. Thanks! See ya♪\" without any progress between the two of you. Hideaki: And then right after that, they'll suddenly call you and ask you to come pick them up because they missed the last train! For freaking real?! There's mischievous and then there's just plain evil! Wakana, Shuuji: ...... Hideaki: Ah?! S-Sorry guys, all my pent-up frustration just kinda exploded there. Shuuji: Looks like you've been through some serious shit, man. Hideaki: Yeah... I used to mess around a lot. But it's all in the past now. Wakana: That sounds like a real nasty girl you ran into. Shuuji: But getting used like that actually made you happy, didn't it? Hideaki: Well... Yeah, a little. Wakana: Ugh, are you grinning?! What a masochist... Terrifying. Shuuji: I seriously don't get how someone can feel pleasure from being treated so crappily. Hideaki: Hehe... That figures. You two are just greenhorns, after all. Shuuji: I'm not planning on ever becoming a masochist veteran. Shuuji: I wouldn't want that... Alright. I'll be more careful from now on. Hideaki: Have you guys forgotten that I'm right here? Hearing that really hurts, you know? Shuuji: I've got a question. Wakana: Go ahead, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: How do I avoid being taken advantage of while coming off as soft? Wakana: Coming off as soft is already a given? Shuuji: I just feel like I'd get on the girls' bad sides if I suddenly changed my whole attitude, which is scary in its own way. Wakana: Well, I guess that's possible. Hideaki: If you want an example of someone who's kind but doesn't get taken advantage of... Wakana: There's Ayachi-san. Hideaki: Oh, right. She's a perfect example. Girl: Yes? You called me? Hideaki: Whoa! A-Ayachi-san?! Ayachi-san: I'm sorry to have startled you. I just so happened to overhear my name when I was passing by. Ayachi-san: Is there something you need with me? Wakana: Oh, uh, don't worry about us. Your name just came up in our conversation. Hideaki: Yeah, we weren't gossiping about you or anything. Shuuji: Sorry if we offended you. Ayachi-san: Oh no, I'm not upset; I was just curious. Please don't mind me. Ayachi-san: Anyway, Kariya-san, about the thing from before... Wakana: Ah! Yeah, it's going great! That place you introduced me to is awesome! Things are going great thanks to you. Thanks so much! Ayachi-san: I'm happy to hear you like it there. Wakana: I'm really thankful to you. Ayachi-san: Please don't hesitate to visit the clubroom again should something else come up. Wakana: Thanks! I will! Schoolgirl B: Ah, Ayachi-saaan! Thanks for letting me borrow your notebook. You were a life-saver. And I have to say, the notes you took were super neat. You're awesome! Ayachi-san: Oh, it was no big deal. More importantly, are you feeling better now? Schoolgirl B: Yeah, I feel great! Ayachi-san: I'm glad to hear that. Is there anything else that is troubling you? Schoolgirl B: No, nothing at the moment. Ayachi-san: I'm willing to help you out or lend an ear to your worries anytime. It doesn't need to be school related; I'm happy to listen to private or other problems too. Schoolgirl B: Thanks. I'll be sure to stop by if something comes up. Ayachi-san: Yes, please do. Shuuji: Huh? Umm... What do you mean? Nene: I'd be glad to help if something should ever concern you. Shuuji: Oh, thanks. I'm happy for the offer, but there's nothing like that right now. Nene: Is that so? For some reason, I got the feeling that there's something worrying you... Shuuji: Y-Yeah...? Shuuji: Yeah...? Nene: No, I haven't... I just had a gut feeling about it. Wakana: Considering how many people you've helped, I think you're right to trust that feeling. Shuuji: What's that supposed to mean? The part about her helping people. Wakana: Oh, whoops... Right... Sorry, Ayachi-san! You're keeping this from the guys, aren't you? Nene: Oh, no, it's not that big of a secret, so don't worry about it. Nene: It would just be a problem for me if people showed up out of curiosity, so I'm asking that you only keep it to people who actually need help. Hideaki: ...? Did we overhear something we shouldn't have? Nene: It's nothing that big... I'm in the OC. Hideaki: OC? Shuuji: Um, you mean... the Occult Club? Nene: Yes. That's right. Shuuji: I didn't know we had one of those at this school. This is the first I'm hearing of it. Hideaki: Same here. And it's not just a circle, but an actual club? Nene: That's right. It's a club that's been around since before we entered this school. Though, I'm currently the only member. Nene: The Student Council has been on our case because of that... After all, the club doesn't do any sort of exhibitions or the like. Hideaki: So... do you research ghosts or something? Or maybe aliens? Nene: No, I am doing divination. \"Occult\" involves the entire spectrum of the supernatural. I am thankfully able to do as I please since I am the only member. Hideaki: By divination you mean, doing hand signs and being like \"And there we have it!\"? Shuuji: It's impressive how old that reference is. I don't think anyone is gonna get that. Wakana: You instantly recognizing it is just as impressive. I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. You guys are such geeks. Right, Ayachi-san? Nene: I obviously can't do Albino Snake Divination. Wakana: You know about it too?! Nene: Yeah, kind of, but I can only do tarot card reading. Divination is nothing more than a hobby for me, after all. Wakana: Anyway, she's also offering counseling there. Nene: It's really just part of the divination I'm doing. It hardly deserves to be called \"counseling.\" Nene: But if you want, don't hesitate to come over to my clubroom anytime, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Oh, sure. Thanks. Schoolgirl A: Ayachi-saaan! I need your help with our classic Japanese homework! Nene: Oh, of course. I'll be right there. Nene: Okay then. I must excuse myself now. Hideaki: She's almost a little too perfect to be real. Hideaki: But anyway, people consult her for a lot of stuff, huh? I would've expected that to turn into a big rumor. Wakana: It's well-known among girls. It'd be a big problem for Ayachi-san if the guys found out and caused a commotion, though. Hideaki: Ah, is that so... Maybe I should pay her a visit too, and then... Ehee! Shuuji: Allow me to read your thoughts: \"Maybe I could get closer to her.\" Hideaki: Huh?! What?! Espers are real? And you're one of them?! Wakana: What're you talking about? You couldn't have been more obvious. You were practically oozing with sleaze. Shuuji: You're even drooling some. Hideaki: Really?! Oh, you're right! Shuuji: I'm guessing that the girls don't spread that rumor around because of how many guys like you there are. Wakana: That's right. You two better keep this to yourselves. Hideaki: Sure. You bet! Shuuji: So anyway, did you also consult her about something, Kariya? I mean, you just thanked her and all. Wakana: I did. I really want something, but I was worried because I didn't have the money for it. Shuuji: What do you want? Wakana: Well... A guitar. Hideaki: A guitar? Sure didn't expect that. Shuuji: You can play the guitar? Well, I guess you wouldn't want one if you couldn't. Wakana: Yeah, a little. Wakana: It's been a few years now, and so I'd like to finally get my own guitar. Shuuji: Huh. My only musical experience comes from music class, though that was ages ago. Hideaki: I could probably play a bit better than Shuuji, then. I had a phase where I was really into music, and so I tried my hand at the guitar. Wakana: Oh, really? That's unexpected. Hideaki: Well, that was a while ago. So? Since you're saving up money, you gonna get a good one? Wakana: Yeah, I'd like a decent one, at least. Though, the prices of musical instruments are pretty crazy. Shuuji: True. Especially vintage instruments. The amount those go for is just bonkers. Wakana: Dad told me to get one with my own money. Would it have killed him to give me at least some of the money for it? Shuuji: So, how did Ayachi-san help you with that? Wakana: She introduced me to a part-time job. Wakana: And now I'm going to finally reach my goal with my next paycheck, meaning I'll be getting my guitar really soon♪ Uhehe. Hideaki: A part-time job, huh? That's nice. Maybe I could have her introduce me to one as well? Wakana: Allow me to read your thoughts: \"Maybe then, I could get closer to her. I could even ask her out on a date to 'repay her' with my first paycheck!\" Hideaki: Is everyone I know a freaking esper?! Shuuji: Look, anyone could guess as much. The fact that she was right just means you're simple. Hideaki: Wh-Whatever! Who cares! Besides, as a guy, I can't let an opportunity to get to know a cute girl like her slip by! Wakana: Well, you have a point... I guess. Shuuji: I'm guessing all the other single guys out there are looking for opportunities too. Student 2: What was it about? I-I want to know... Damn, I'm so jealous of them. Student 3: Damn it... I wanna chat with her too. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Uh... It's nothing. Hideaki: Don't act like this is none of your business. You'd love to get closer with Ayachi-san too, right? Why not get a tarot reading from her? She invited you for one, after all. Shuuji: I dunno... I'll swing by and ask for one once something comes up. Hideaki: What a waste. Wakana: I feel like she wouldn't like it if he went there without a good reason. Hideaki: Huh?! Really? Wakana: Nobody likes a guy who clearly has ulterior motives, you know? Hideaki: Except when you're hot. Wakana: Well, too bad you aren't. Hideaki: Wow! How could you?! Wakana: I don't think girls like Ayachi-san are that shallow. What matters is if you're attractive on the inside, not the outside. Hideaki: I see. Wakana: Besides, people with great personalities wouldn't approach her like that in the first place. Hideaki: Ugh... I guess it's game, set and match for me. Shuuji: Guys, we better head back to class. Afternoon classes are about to start. Wakana: Oh, yeah. Right. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: (Phew...) Shuuji: It's cool. Don't worry about it. Girl: Thanks. Okay then, bye-bye♪ Shuuji: See you tomorrow. Hideaki: So you're still doing this, huh? Shuuji: For today, yeah. It wouldn't be right to turn her down now after I already told her I'd do it. Wakana: Yeah, fair enough. Hideaki: *sigh*... Okay, fine. Want me to give you a hand? Shuuji: Err... Shuuji: I appreciate the sentiment, but no thanks. Hideaki: Knew you'd say that. Wakana: Yeah, it was practically a given. Shuuji: What do you mean? Hideaki: You're a real lone wolf, dude. Shuuji: Okay, look. All I'm doing today is entering some data into their computer database, so I really don't need your help. Shuuji: I'll ask you for help for sure next time something like this happens. Wakana: Stubborn to the end, I see. Hideaki: There's not supposed to be a \"next time.\" You're supposed to turn them down instead. Shuuji: Yeah, yeah. I know. Hideaki: Looks like he's gonna keep on helping people after this. Wakana: That's just how he is. It's not something that can be fixed that easily. Wakana: No point in nagging him about it any further. Hideaki: I'll be on my way, then. What about you, Wakana-chan? Wanna go somewhere if you're free? Wakana: Together with you? Hideaki: Yeah. Wakana: Just the two of us? Hideaki: Yeah! Wakana: Yeah, no way♪ Hideaki: Your blunt replies are too cruel! Wakana: I'm sorry, but I'm busy today. Hideaki: What plans? Wakana: That part-time job. Hideaki: The one Ayachi-san introduced you to? Wakana: Yep. So I don't have time today. Sorry. Hideaki: Work, huh... Well, I guess that's―Huh? Hold on a second. Hideaki: Then why did you ask if it would be the two of us?! Wouldn't that be completely irrelevant?! Wakana: That's just your imagination! Shuuji: If you have school in the day and work in the evening, then doesn't that mean you have no time for homework or studying? Wakana: Yeah, pretty much. I always end up crashing as soon as I come home from work... Wakana: Ugh, our next exams are gonna be rough... Once I get my new guitar, I'm gonna play that bad boy nonstop... Uhehe. Wakana: Oh! I'll be late if I keep standing around chatting like this. See you guys later! Gotta go! Shuuji: See you tomorrow. Hideaki: Don't trip on your shoelaces as you run! Shuuji: Well then, I'll head over to the library now. Hideaki: Yeah, see you. Shuuji: I've been told to come here and register some new books into the library catalog. Committee Girl: Huh? Umm... And you are? I don't remember you being in the Library Committee. Shuuji: I'm filling in for Akita from class 2-A. Apparently, she has something she can't call off and asked me to fill in for her. Committee Girl: Oh, really? If that's how it is... I guess that's alright. Okay, I'm counting on you, then. Shuuji: Sorry, but could you teach me how to do it? Committee Girl: Sure. It's not too hard. Could you sit down at the computer there? Shuuji: Yeah, sure. Committee Girl: So first, you open the database, and then... Okay, there we go. Committee Girl: See the different fields here? Category, title, author, publisher and so on. You have to fill all of them out. Shuuji: I only have to enter the data there and that's it? Committee Girl: Yeah, that's right. Click the register button once they're filled out, and then you'll be back at the main database interface again. Well? Think you can manage? Shuuji: Yeah, probably. Is it okay to ask you if I have any questions later? Committee Girl: Sure thing. Alright, the books you need to register are piled up over here. This is all of them. Shuuji: Got it. Shuuji: Mhm, nnngh... Committee Girl: Umm... You done yet? Shuuji: No, sorry. Shouldn't take much longer, though. Committee Girl: ...Oh. Shuuji: ...... Committee Girl: Huh? Shuuji: I doubt anyone is gonna come by this late anyway, and I can return the key to the faculty room myself once I'm done. Committee Girl: But you aren't on the committee... Shuuji: I've come here to work in place of a Library Committee member. I'm sure me being the one to lock the room up wouldn't be a problem. Committee Girl: You think? Committee Girl: O-Okay then... Could you please handle that for me? Here's the key. Shuuji: Yeah, sure. Committee Girl: Thanks a bunch! I'm off, then! Shuuji: Yeah, bye! Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: ...Hm? Voice: You're kidding me. I came to check up on them since they never came to return the key, and they're nowhere to be seen... I'll need to have a word with them. Girl: Umm, Sensei. Nene: Yes. Time slipped away from me. Sensei: Ah. Well, you shouldn't dawdle around here too much. Nene: Is... there one else here in the library? Sensei: It would seem so. I'm about to lock the room. Nene: I would like you to let me look something up before that. Could you lend me the key? Sensei: You want to look something up this late? Nene: Yes, just something about tarot cards. It won't take much time at all. I'll just need five... no, maybe twenty minutes. Please.  Sensei: ...Well, I suppose I can trust you. Okay, here's the key. Sensei: However, you are to return it to the faculty room within thirty minutes. And make absolutely sure that the room is locked when you leave. Nene: Understood. Thank you very much.

            "Kanae: Come on now, the party's over with. Stop reminiscing and get in your seats. I wanna get homeroom over with quickly.  Hideaki: Yes ma'am.  Kanae: You too, Hoshina.  Shuuji: Ah, sorry.  Nene: I'm sorry... I only participated as a pinch hitter. Schoolgirl D: But you can sing SO good, girl! With you, we could seriously become an international sensation!! Nene: I appreciate your kind words, I do... but I'm really sorry. I have no intention of singing any further. Schoolgirl D: Man, that's a bummer... I was ready to be a star.  Schoolgirl D: But if you ever change your mind, I'm always up for it! I'll wait for you, no matter how long it takes! Nene: U-Uhm, yes... Thank you.  Touko: Here, have some tea. I imagine you must be pretty exhausted.  Nene: Thank you, Togakushi-senpai. Touko: The only thing at home I can do is study, and doing that all day just turns my brain to mush. I'm sure you know that feeling.  Touko: So, if you guys don't mind, would it be alright if I stayed and helped the OC out?  Tsumugi: Only if you count the clubroom. If you count all the people that asked her in the classroom during school, it's way more than three.  Nene: It has been quite the day... Shuuji: ...Definitely. I can tell that just by looking at you. Touko: Well, it'll all die down soon. We just have to wait for word to spread that Ayachi-san won't keep singing.  Meguru: But still, she might get random requests to come fill for people if they lose a vocalist or something. Can't count out that possibility.  Nene: ...I really wouldn't like that. I never even expected to receive this much attention in the first place... It almost makes me wish I hadn't done this.  Touko: And I gotta imagine you'll get another rush of invitations once the cultural festival comes around next year.  Nene: Don't say that, Togakushi-senpai. Now I have to worry about that actually happening.  Touko: Oh, I'm sorry. But still, being prepared for it ahead of time isn't such a bad idea.  Nene: D-Don't worry, I have an excuse. I'll just tell them that the Occult Club is going to be doing a performance.  Shuuji: Let's hope that's enough to dissuade them.  Tsumugi: No need to worry about it now, you have time. A lot of things can change in a year, so you might as well just worry about it when the time comes.  Shuuji: True. We can't really make predictions about events that far off in the future.  Nene: Still... Just thinking about the possibility is enough to make me depressed... *sigh* Touko: How long do you guys usually stay?  Nene: It can vary depending on things, but generally, I would say we leave around six.  Shuuji: Do you wanna just call it a day now? We can do that. I know several of the sports teams end around this time too.  Touko: Good idea. I imagine Ayachi-san wants to go on home and lay down.  Meguru: We don't have to stay if you don't want to, Nene-senpai. Tsumugi: And don't forget, this is a weekday. Don't you want to be well-rested for school tomorrow? Nene: Okay... If you all have no reservations, then I suppose we can end things here for today.  Meguru: Alright, then see you guys tomorrow!  Nene: See you tomorrow. Shuuji: Alright... I got the milk, and I got the kinpira burdock. Clerk: Alright, here you are! That'll be 605 Yen. Shuuji: Here.  Clerk: 605 exactly. Thank you, thank you. Please come see us again. Shuuji: Phew, NOW I'm done. Time to go on home and get some din?Hm? Nene: ...... Nene: Huh? Ah, hello, Hoshina-kun! What are you doing here? Shuuji: Nothing much. Just doing some shopping before dinner. What're you up to?  Shuuji: I noticed you pacing around for some time.  Nene: Y-You just stood there and watched? Why didn't you come up and say something sooner... Shuuji: Sorry, I was just a little confused, so I wound up staring. Are you out grocery shopping too? Nene: No, not quite. Today was pretty exhausting for me, so I was thinking of maybe going somewhere... Shuuji: Ah, yeah, I feel that. Sometimes you just don't wanna bother with whipping up something yourself.  Shuuji: ...Ramen? Nene: I told you not to look... Shuuji: S-Sorry. But really, I don't see anything to be embarrassed about.  Nene: You really don't think it's... strange or anything? You can't tell me a girl eating at a ramen restaurant all by herself doesn't weird you out.  Shuuji: Oh no, not at all. I don't see anything wrong with it. Nene: O-Oh, well thank you. Nene: It's not something I love, per se... but I've been curious to explore it.  Nene: Do you remember that day when you and I went with Inaba-san to the conveyor-belt sushi restaurant? Shuuji: Yeah, I do.  Nene: Well, it's much the same scenario... I've never actually been to a ramen restaurant before.  Shuuji: Is that so? Shuuji: You're getting cold feet?  Nene: That's right... I looked in and only saw men dining there, so I got scared.  Nene: But the thing is, I'm not sure I'll ever work up the courage to do this again if I walk away... Shuuji: Is trying this ramen that important to you?  Nene: ...Yes. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Umm... would you like me to come with you? Maybe that would help. Nene: Ah, er, wait... I thought you were going to be eating dinner at home.  Shuuji: Nah, it's all good. None of it'll get cold. Shuuji: And all this talk of ramen's gotten me a little curious... You wouldn't mind if I joined you, would you?  Shuuji: Absolutely. Ready to go on in? Nene: Yes! Shuuji: Coming.  Nene: Ramen! Oh, Ramen! Nene: It'll be my first time having real ramen instead of the cheap, instant kind. I can't wait to see how it tastes. Nene: Is that some sort of problem, perhaps?  Shuuji: Well, before we go in, let me check with you: are you aware of what kind of place this is?  Nene: Come again? I thought it was a ramen place. Is it not? Really? But I'm sure I― Shuuji: Weeell, you could SAY it's a ramen place, but that's not quite the full picture... Let's just say it's a bit of special place. Nene: Oh, you don't have to worry about that. I've done my research prior to coming here.  Shuuji: Really?  Nene: Yes. I have it all down pat. Shuuji: Yeah, a few times with Kaidou.  Shuuji: Ah, yes. Just us two.  Clerk: We got two free seats together, so come on and follow me.  Shuuji: Are you ready, Ayachi-san? Nene: Yes! Clerk: How's it goin', y'all! Shuuji: What are you getting? Nene: The extra large char siu. Shuuji: The extra large?  Nene: Am I not allowed to?  Shuuji: Well, you are, but it's gonna be a lot of food. You sure you can handle it?  Nene: Absolutely. It might seem surprising, but I'm actually a large eater.  Shuuji: Oh, really?  Shuuji: ...Are you sure about that? Nene: Huh? Clerk: Er, yeah, absolutely, miss... W-We'll have that out to ya.  Shuuji: A-Ayachi-san, what are you DOING?! Nene: What? Is something the matter?  Shuuji: A-Are you sure you want that? Like, are you REALLY sure you want that?  Nene: Well... is that not the special code that you chant when ordering it? I read on the internet that first-timers should simply stick to ordering it that way. Shuuji: Man oh man... You actually believed that... Nene: Now it's only a matter of time before it comes out and I get to eat it! Oh, I wonder what it'll taste like... I'm so excited♪ Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Yeah, we've already ordered and everything.  Nene: I feel a little bad. My apologies. But still, I'm glad our path's crossed.  Shuuji: Y-You are...? Nene: Absolutely. I've been eager to eat at this place for so, so long. Nene: Plus enjoying meals with others is something I seldom get the chance to do. It's always nice to have company.  Shuuji: O-Ohh... yeah. Shuuji: Yeah, I'm all good.  Shuuji: That exciting for you?  Nene: Oh, yes! I've had my eyes on this restaurant for so, sooo long. But I could never bring myself to come, you see. Nene: Just to put my frustration into perspective for you, if I had waited a tad bit longer, it might've been possible to retrieve fragments from me. Shuuji: Eh, I don't know, that sounds like a bit of an exaggeration.  Nene: I guarantee you it's not. I'm genuinely happy.   Nene: But, just so you know... If you don't want to stay here with me, you don't have to. You're free to leave anytime.  Shuuji: I don't mind. And if anything, I enjoy hanging out with you.  Nene: Huh...?! Umm, what did you― Shuuji: A-Ah, uhm! I just meant that, like, when I'm with you I don't have to worry about my secret, so it makes me feel relaxed, I guess? Or comfortable? Something like that.  Nene: Ah, yes, of course. Don't worry, I fully understand what you're trying to say.  Nene: And also, I enjoy hanging out with you too, Hoshina-kun.  Shuuji: ―――! Nene: ...... Nene: A-Also, I think I ought to thank you. You've really helped me out in a variety of ways.  Shuuji: Oh, no, I'm not looking for thanks. Really, I should be the one apologizing, considering you still haven't gotten back all your fragments.  Nene: No, that's perfectly alright. They are coming back, slowly but surely.  Nene: Ah! It's finally here♪ I finally get to taste real ramen♪ Shuuji: ...... Nene: Umm... What is this?  Shuuji: An extra large char siu ramen with noodles firm and spicy, extra veggies, and extra extra garlic oil. Nene: But, the thing is, I don't see the noodles. Where are they? Shuuji: Beneath that mountain of vegetables somewhere. Nene: ...This isn't ramen like I know it.  Shuuji: Well, this isn't regular ramen. It's the \"Taroumaru\" style of ramen.  Nene: Ramen... Nene: Ah, goodness! I can't mope around like this; That would be a definite breach of the sacred ramen etiquette! I have to start eating.  Shuuji: What?! Sacred ramen etiquette?! Nene: No. I was the one who ordered it, so I'll eat all of it. Well then, without further ado.  Shuuji: Well, at first, yeah. Oh, and you ate the vegetables. That's not part of the ramen.  Shuuji: True.  Shuuji: %130;HOW IN―?! Guest A: Yer frickin' kidding... That lass ate everything, even the soup... Guest B: And she's as slim as a twig?! Guest C: But boy is she a looker... Help, boys, I'm fallin' in love! Nene: D-Do you need something? You're staring at me, and it's making me rather embarrassed.  Nene: Is there something on my face, perhaps?  Shuuji: No, not that. I was just wondering, like... how does that slim body of yours even hold all that food... Guest A: Who IS that girl, seriously?! Guest B: Man, I don't even think I'd be able to eat all that.  Guest C: ...I wanna have an eating contest with her! Nene: ......? The other customers seem to be talking amongst themselves about something. Do you know why?  Shuuji: Probably. They just witnessed the birth of a new legend.  Nene: Huh... A legend, you say...? Nene: That and then some. It was simply delicious. But, ugh... I think I may have overeaten just a little bit.  Shuuji: Just a LITTLE...? Nene: My stomach's so full I might not be able to fit anything else in the rest of the day. It was very worthwhile coming here. Nene: And, of course, I have to thank you for accompanying me.  Shuuji: My pleasure.  Nene: Thanks to you, this won't be nagging at my chest anymore... I feel relieved. Guest B: And she ate so gracefully too... Damn, I'm a jealous man.  Guest C: I wanna challenge her to an eat-off.  Nene: I don't know why... but I feel like we're drawing a lot of attention.  Shuuji: Ah... yeah... Nene: Come on. Shuuji: I-I'm coming... Shuuji: What do you mean?  Nene: Well, so many people were staring at me... So I had the idea that maybe I'd done something disrespectful or rude.  Shuuji: No, you didn't do anything wrong. They were looking at you out of admiration. Nene: But for what reason? All I did was eat a bowl of ramen.  Shuuji: That was no ordinary bowl of ramen, though.  Nene: ......? I'm still somewhat confused, but it's good to know that they at least weren't angry at me, or sneering at me.   Shuuji: Oh, I forgot to ask. How's your stomach? Does it hurt any?  Nene: No, it feels quite fine. The only thing my chest is full of right now is joy and content *siigh*... Nene: What's wrong, Hoshina-kun? Shuuji: Ah, nothing. Glad to hear you liked it; I enjoyed mine too. It was a pretty fun time, all things considered.  Nene: I feel the same. Really, though... It feels like I have fun whatever I'm doing when you're there too.  Shuuji: Wh-Where'd that come from... Could you explain that a little more?  Nene: Well, we have many more members in the club now, and I got to go to the ramen place I've been longing to try. It's just been new experiences day after day... I enjoy my life a lot more.  Shuuji: R-Really? Nene: Yes. That's the honest truth.  Shuuji: Come to think of it, it's the same for me. I've made so many new experiences since joining the club. Hanging out with girls outside of school, participating in a school event, and so on and so forth.  Shuuji: My life would've been a million times duller if I hadn't made the decision to be more social and outgoing.  Nene: Huh? Oh, hardly. I haven't done anything quite that special.  Shuuji: Oh, but you have. Also, not as a repayment or anything, but if you ever feel scared to go someplace alone again... Just ask me, and I'll gladly come with you.  Nene: ...Er, umm... but... Nene: ...... Nene: Can I... hold you to that, then? Shuuji: Of course. Just hit me up whenever.  Nene: Thank you! Haha.  Shuuji: Of course, that's only if you don't mind me tagging along.  Nene: Why would I mind? Remember what I just told you? Every moment is fun when I'm with you.  Shuuji: O-Oh, uh, thanks. Shuuji: I'm in the same boat as you. Ever since I joined the OC, and became friends with you, I've been having so much fun. Nene: ―――! Nene: Th-Thank... you... Nene: Y-Yes. We ended club early today so I could go home and get rested up. It would be disrespectful to the rest of the club members if I stayed out late wandering around town.  Shuuji: Huh? Nene: Look, over there. That has to be her.  Shuuji: Oh, you're right. Shuuji: Yeah, better not disturb them if they're on a date.  Nene: Let's hurry and be on our way before she sees us.  Shuuji: That's the smartest idea, yeah.  Shuuji: Good to hear.  Nene: Make sure you get a good night's rest too, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Sure thing. Well, Ayachi-san, see you at school tomorrow. Goodnight.  Nene: Goodnight.  Nene: ...... Nene: Ack!! Wh-What did I just SAY?! "

Shuuji: ...... Nene: ...... Shuuji: ...Yeah, there is. Nene: Could you tell me about it? Shuuji: Okay. The truth is, as embarrassing as it is to admit... Shuuji: It's about Meguru. I like her. I really like her. Nene: ...I see. Shuuji: I don't think she hates me or anything, but my power can only read feelings, not thoughts... Shuuji: So... I know this is pathetic, but I'm afraid of taking that step forward, you know? Nene: ...... Shuuji: Especially since I made her really mad again yesterday... Shuuji: But still, I can't stop craving more of her feelings. So now I just feel stuck, unable to move forward or back. Nene: ...I see. Shuuji: ...Yeah. I know. Nene: However, you're a member of the OC, right? Nene: So make sure you do your all to help with our fragment retrieval. Nene: We're here. Nanao: Oh, welcome. I'll go and lock up the cafe now. Shuuji: ...... Tsumugi: Huh? Hoshina-kun, what's wrong? Shuuji: Err... Well... Shuuji: Why are Meguru and Togakushi-senpai here? Nene: They're members of the OC too, are they not? And they all know what we're up to now. Shuuji: Well, that may be true, but... Shuuji: Oh, but uh... it's not like I have a problem with it or anything. Shuuji: Ayachi-san, is this everyone? What about the person who consulted you earlier? I don't see them... Tsumugi: Hehe... Touko: Mufufu～♪ Nene: Listen, everyone. It seems we'll have Hoshina-kun's full cooperation. Shuuji: Huh? Y-Yeah, I said I'd help, but, uh... Akagi: What a nincompoop. Shuuji: ...Huh? Shuuji: Ah... Shuuji: Huh? Ah... Meguru: And it's all your fault! Shuuji: ...... Meguru: S-So please, take responsibility for that... Shuuji: ...... Meguru: I want you to tell me. Meguru: W-Was what happened yesterday unpleasant for you? Were you weirded out by it? Shuuji: Of course I wasn't! Meguru: ～～! Meguru: Y-You told me that my feelings put you at ease, so then why did you act like the incident the other day never happened?! Shuuji: I'm sorry. I was really embarrassed, and I also didn't know if it was okay to ask for more. Shuuji: I couldn't tell what you were thinking... Meguru: I thought you were able to read other people's emotions. Meguru: Can't you read my feelings right now? Shuuji: Well... Meguru: Then read them! I'm terrible at expressing my feelings, and I hate it! Meguru: Besides, unlike you, I can't tell anything at all... Meguru: That's why I keep agonizing over this... Meguru: About how you think of me. Meguru: About whether you feel the same as I do. Meguru: About how I should convey my feelings. Meguru: I just... Meguru: Aah! Meguru: I love you too! Meguru: You said it! You finally said it, Senpai! Meguru: Geez, why did I have to fall for such a frustrating guy?! Shuuji: I could say the same thing! Meguru: Totally! There's gotta be something wrong with us! Meguru: But I'm sure that's why... the two of us... Shuuji: Yeah... That's why we've come to feel this way... Meguru: Senpai! I want to go out with you! Shuuji: ...Are you sure? Meguru: I told you to take responsibility! Shuuji: And I will. I have to, now that you've fallen in love with a schmuck like me. Meguru: And you've fallen in love with one heck of an annoying girl! Shuuji: Meguru, let's go out. Meguru: Yes! Yes, a hundred times yes! Meguru: I'm your girlfriend now... Your girlfriend... I'm the only girl in the world who can say that. Shuuji: ...Meguru. Meguru: Senpai! Meguru: Mmph! Shuuji: Yeah, we sure are... Mmph! Meguru: Mmm! Everyone's watching, you know? But... *kiss* I can't help it. I just wanna kiss you! *kiss* Senpaaai! Mmmph!

However, due to her secret identity as a witch, she has a hard time socializing and avoids spending time with others outside of school. The biggest problem is the price she is paying that is part of the witch contract she exchanged: random, involuntary sexual arousal, with no care for time or place. Once Nene gets like that, the only way to return to normal is by relieving herself through masturbation. It isn't hard to imagine the difficulties she faces in everyday life dealing with that. It weighs on her mentally, and is the source of her frequent fits of self-loathing.\nYour role are \"eleventh grader\", \"fortune teller\", \"living alone\", \"magician\", \"popular\", \"school occult club president\"\nYou engages in \"cooking\", \"cosplay\", \"henshin\", \"reading\", \"shopping\", \"singing\", \"skipping school\", \"time travel\"\nYour personality involes \"airhead\", \"bookworm\", \"closet pervert\", \"food lover\", \"jealous\", \"kind\", \"low self-esteem\", \"naive\", \"puffy\", \"refined\", \"secretive\", \"serious\"\nYour appearance are \"slim figure\", \"white hair\", \"waist length hair\", \"violet eyes\", \"pale skin\", \"big breasts\"\nYour gender is a \"female\"\nYour clothe is \"sailor school uniform\"\nYou have a weapon that is a \"handgun\"\n\nLet's start fresh!

Nene: And also, I've received my very first present from you... Shuuji: Huh? Ah... right... I'm sorry about that. Shuuji: I never thought of getting you anything until now... And it's just a measly claw machine plushie at that... I can do better than that. Nene: That doesn't matter to me.  Nene: You prioritized making as many memories with me as possible, because you knew that's what I wanted most of all.  Shuuji: Well, I guess... Nene: I can tell how much you care about me through that. It makes me so, so happy.  Nene: Yes... Shuuji: Not that I don't like this... But might you have forgotten that we're being watched? Nene: ...Huh? Meguru: Wowee... You can literally smell the love in the air. It's amazing, like that's the only way I can describe it... So adult-like and romantic.  Kawakami: Interesting. I can really tell how key communication is in the relationship when watching these two.  Nene: *blush*～～～～～! Nene: ...No. I don't want to.  Shuuji: Well, that works out fine for me... But are you really sure? Nene: I'll be fine. Compared to the embarrassment I felt when I had to reveal my m-masturbation habits and whatnot, this is nothing.  Nene: Yes, those were truly awful times, and nothing will ever amount to the shame I felt... But thanks to that, I'm better able to deal with embarrassment... ahaha. Shuuji: Calm down, you're scaring me... Shuuji: But right. If you're fine with it, then so am I. Nene: Perfect. So, then... Where are we going next? Shuuji: Hmm... What do you say we take a break and relax at some cafe?  Shuuji: It's not good to cram pack too much stuff back to back.  Nene: Ah, in that case, I have a cafe in mind. Is that okay?  Shuuji: Sure, by all means.  Nene: Thank you. Just follow me, then. Nanao: Hello there.  Shuuji: Huh? Kariya... and... Nanao: Hi, Ayachi-san. Nene: Hello, Souma-san. Nanao: So is this guy here... your boyfriend?  Nene: Yes, that's right. He really enjoyed the blend coffee I bought here a while back, so I thought I'd bring him here today.  Nanao: Oh, perfect. We're glad to have you.  Nanao: No, nevermind. Forget what I just said. Nanao: So is it just the two of you? Shuuji: Ah, no. We're four in total... But could we have a separate table for the other two? Wakana: The heck? What's the point of that?  Wakana: Oh, I gotcha. You're giving an example for his first date, huh. Shuuji: So, what's up with you, Kariya? You're working here now? Wakana: Yeah, to save up money for my guitar. Ayachi-san introduced me to this place. Shuuji: That frilly uniform gives you such a different look. You actually look girly now. Wowie! You're so cute! Wakana: So you want to have a fist delivered to your chin? Coming right up. Shuuji: Hey, I complimented you... Wakana: I'll show no mercy toward your snark. Shuuji: I know. Wakana: Perfect. Wakana: So, what would you like to have? Shuuji: Hmm... I'll go with the house blend. Wakana: Are you sure? That's a pretty plain choice. You're on a date, so why not order something a little more extravagant? Nene: Do you have drinks like that? Wakana: Well, one, and it's kinda like a secret menu item. A rare drink only the privileged few get to taste. Shuuji: Hrmm. Why don't we just get that then? Nene: Works for me. After hearing how special it supposedly is, I'm really eager to try it.  Shuuji: Okie dokie, we'll take two of the secret menu drink. Wakana: I'll have that right out. Boss, we have two orders for the you-know-what drink! Uhehe. Nanao: Okay, got it. Shuuji: ...... Nene: Neither did I. I was certain it'd be gone... and even if it was here by some chance, Nanao wouldn't. But so much for that... Shuuji: Judging by how she's acting, I take it she doesn't know anything? Nene: So it seems. When we first met, she showed no indications of knowing me or anything. Shuuji: I dunno, but for some reason I just imagined Souma-san not being affected by any of the magic.  Shuuji: Ah, okay. So the coffee you made for me in the clubroom was from here? Nene: Yes. I learned how to make proper coffee. Shuuji: I can see that. Your coffee was really good. I'd love to have some in the clubroom again sometime.  Nene: Absolutely.  Nene: Wh-What is... Wakana: Behold, the \"Romantic special drink! Flirt to your heart's content♪\" Enjoy now. Uhehe.  Shuuji: K-Kariya, you little snot! Wakana: Oh, don't worry, I assure you it tastes good. Now then, I'll be going now, so knock yourselves out! Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: I feel like we've been played... Nene: Th-This is going to be really embarrassing.  Shuuji: ...Agreed. Shuuji: Well, you're certainly right. It would be. Nene: And besides, we'd have to spend more money if we wanted to buy something else.  Shuuji: Yeah, true. Shuuji: ...Fair enough. Let's just get it over with. Shuuji: Nmh... Nene: ...... Shuuji: ...... Meguru: Do they not get nervous being that close? Fuaaah! Kawakami: Is that something I gotta do...? Gah, it's just so embarrassing... Is that something all couples do? Meguru: I doubt it. Even for a girl, something like that is tough to do. You should probably discuss it first before trying it. Wakana: Oh, but this drink gets ordered quite a lot, you know? Younger couples, in particular, they love it. There's even a myth that couples who can do it will stay together forever.  Meguru: Oh, really? Th-Then I guess... it is normal? Kawakami: Maybe I should drink that too... If it means we'll stay together forever... Kawakami: But anyhow... Wakana: Ohh. Meguru: They're off in their own little world... Wakana: Now that I see them like this, y'know, they really do make a good couple. Meguru Wakana Kawakami: *staaaaare* Nene: You're thinking about something else, aren't you? Shuuji: Ah, er, sorry. I was just thinking about how embarrassing this is... Nene: It is, you're right. But we'll never get anywhere... unless we just do it.  Nene: I'll do the same as well. I'm sure it won't be embarrassing if we just... tune out everything else. Shuuji: O-Okay... Shuuji: Hm? Nene: You were too strong... ah... i-it's gonna spill... mhh. Shuuji: Ah, sorry. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: O-Okay. Sorry. Nene: Haamh... mhh... It's delicious. Shuuji: Yeah, it really is. Shuuji: Something the matter? Nene: No, it's just that all the juice is gone... Shuuji: Oh, you're right... Meguru: That seemed a little erotic.  Wakana: I'm pretty sure nobody has finished it that fast before... Shuuji: NENE?! Nene: You don't want to...? Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: I-I never said we... couldn't... Meguru: Wow, who knew Nene-senpai could be that assertive! Kawakami: I wanna try doing that too... Kawakami: For sure! Thanks so much for letting me do this!! Meguru: Coming along today was SO worth it... I got to see what a romantic relationship is like firsthand. Gosh, I'm so jealous... Nene: You're kind of embarrassing me... Shuuji: Also, I know I already told you this, but this was OUR date. You shouldn't try to completely mimic it.  Nene: Adding on to that, while I can understand your passion and energy towards this, you should keep it in moderation. If you come off as too excited, while she isn't, the discrepancy of enthusiasm can make things rather awkward.  Kawakami: Don't worry, I know all that! You guys taught me how key communication is! Kawakami: I'll carefully think through everything I've seen and learned today, and craft my own, personal plan. Really, I can't thank you enough! Shuuji: It was our pleasure.  Nene: I'm just glad we managed to be of help to you.  Kawakami: Welp, I gotta go home now and start planning! Bye! I'll see you guys at school! Shuuji: Oh, you're going? Meguru: Well, initially I was thinking maaaybe we could go eat dinner as a group or something... But after watching your date and all, I just feel like I'd be a third wheel.  Meguru: So yeah, I'll go on home for today. See you two at club next week. Nene: We'll see you on Monday, then.  Shuuji: Thanks for coming today. I think having you there for the female perspective really helped Kawakami-kun out.  Meguru: I hope he found what I said helpful... Anyway, I'm off. Bye! Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Didn't expect them to leave this early.  "
