            "Mikado: Is not about the carbonara, no. I shall leave that matter completely up to you. Kousei: Alright. I'll try preparing a few more dishes next week as an experiment. Maybe up the order limit to twenty-five. Kanna: Sounds good. Anyway, I'm sure you can guess why I've asked you two to stay behind. Mei: This is about my eye again, isn't it? Kanna: We just want to know how things are progressing, so this shouldn't take too much of your time. Has anything changed with your eye since we last spoke? Mei: No. I still don't know how to release my butterflies... Kanna: Not to worry. I'm certain you'll get there eventually. Mikado: Our main purpose in opening this cafe has always been to collect butterflies. Thanks to you, that task has been proceeding expeditiously. Mikado: Allow me to thank you for your hard work once again. We owe you our gratitude. Mei: A-All I'm doing is catching butterflies. I'd wouldn't exactly call that \"hard work\"... Mei: B-But either way, I'll continue to do my best to help! Mikado: Thank you. We appreciate it. Mei: ...... Mikado: But while I appreciate your efforts, I will not be transforming into a cat. Mei: Okay. I'm sorry. Kanna: Allow me to thank you as well, Takamine-san. Kousei: Huh? Why me? Kanna: While it was mere coincidence that brought you here to work with us, you've become an invaluable member of our team. Kanna: Many of our customers even come to our cafe specifically to eat your dishes now. Kanna: So thank you very much. You've been an incredible help to us all. Kousei: Well, I mean... this was all because of that \"problem\" I had with my soul in the first place... Kousei: But I'm glad you appreciate me. Honestly, this job has been pretty fulfilling for me too lately. Mikado: Indeed. It would appear your soul's condition has been greatly improving. Kanna: You can't let your guard down just yet, but as long as you keep heading in the right direction, you won't have anything to worry about. Kousei: Phew. That's a relief to hear. I owe it all to Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Huh? Kousei: Thanks for guiding me in the right direction. Mei: N-No, I didn't do anything. Kousei: You did. Thank you for everything. Mei: I-I... Mei: ...... Mei: U-Um, was there anything else you wanted to discuss? Kanna: No, I believe that's it. Mei: In that case, I've got something I need to do, so--! Mikado: Alright. Then we apologize for keeping you. Mei: That's okay! Anyway, I'll be going now! Kousei: Let me walk you-- Mei: Good night! Kousei: Huh? Kousei: Y-Yeah, I am... Kanna: Good night. Kousei: Yeah. Good night... Kousei: ...... Kousei: I should've known... Mei: Y-You're fine. Kousei: Freaking out? Mei: Y-Yeah... I... Um... Mei: ...... Mei: Oh, gosh... I'm so nervous... Mei: U-Umm... I think it would take too long to explain myself, so... h-here! Mei: Yes. It's... my Valentine's Day gift... to you. Kousei: Chocolate! Mei: Y-Yes. It's chocolate, and it's, um... handmade. Kousei: Handmade! Mei: Wow, you're really excited about this... Suzune-san taught me how to make it, so it should taste alright... I think. Kousei: Oh... Is that why you've been going home together lately? Mei: Yeah. I've been going to her apartment so she could teach me. Mei: She's also been helping me by asking you about your preferences and stuff... Kousei: My preferences? Oh, wait. Mei: Ahaha... Sorry. I guess I just felt kind of embarrassed... Kousei: Is that why the others said they weren't giving me any chocolate this year? So this would be a surprise? Mei: What? I don't know anything about that... Mei: But the others knew I was planning on giving you my own chocolate, so... I guess that could be why they did that... Kousei: Phew. I thought for sure you hated me or something... Mei: Wh-What?! Of course not! Why would you think that? Kousei: I mean, you've been avoiding me lately, haven't you? Mei: I-I wasn't... I mean... Well, maybe a little... Kousei: See? Mei: That's only because I didn't want you to find out I was preparing chocolate for you... Mei: But... I'm sorry for acting so weird. I didn't mean to give you the wrong idea. Kousei: It's alright. I've been really anxious these past few days, so it's a relief to know the truth. Mei: Urk... I'm sorry... Kousei: Handmade chocolate, though... This is more than I expected. Thank you. Mei: Um, if you'd like... you're welcome to go ahead and eat it... Kousei: Right now? Mei: Yeah. I actually brought you a fork too. Kousei: To be honest, I was planning to go home and savor it there... Mei: N-No, please! You can't! You can't keep me waiting that long! Mei: My heart's already pounding so fast it's about to explode! Mei: I need to know how you think it tastes right now... or else I'm going to die! Kousei: A-Alright. I'll have a bite... Mei: Please do! There are two inside, so at least try one of them! Right now! Mei: Something like that. It's called a chocolate fondant. Kousei: Sounds fancy. Was it hard to make? Mei: Not at all. Suzune-san was there to guide me through every single step. Mei: Ah, but just for the record--I made this all by myself! And I think I did a pretty good job! Mei: Though, um... it was a lot crispier on the outside when it came out of the oven, but it might be a bit soggy by now. Mei: But it shouldn't taste bad! This was Suzune-san's own personal recipe! I baked it with the utmost care! Mei: The flavor should be to your liking as well! So p-please, go ahead and try some! Kousei: Alright... don't mind if I do then. Mei: H-Help yourself! Kousei: ...... Mei: H-Hello? Kousei: ...... Mei: Senpai? Kousei: ...... Mei: Um... Does it... taste bad? Kousei: It's delicious. Mei: R-Really? Oh, thank goodness! Kousei: Oh god... It's so delicious... Mei: Wait, what? Huh? Kousei: How? How can something taste THIS good?! Mei: O-Oh, come on... You're exaggerating... Kousei: *sniffle*... Mei: Wait, are you crying? You're not pretending, are you? No way. Like, seriously? You're seriously crying? Kousei: I can't help it... Mei: O-Okay? Kousei: Everyone kept saying they wouldn't be giving me any chocolate... Mei: Oh... right. They said it'd be a hassle to get return gifts for everyone. Kousei: Even Nozomi, who usually gives me chocolates every year... gave me nothing. Mei: Wait, every year? Oh, right. You and Nozomi-chan are childhood friends. Kousei: Yeah, but she said she'd only been giving them to me out of force of habit... Mei: Oh... Err... I'm not sure what to say to that. Kousei: In the end, the only person who gave me chocolates was you... And handmade chocolate too... Kousei: Thank you... Thank you, Hiuchidani-san! Mei: I didn't think you'd be THIS emotional... but I'm glad you like it. Mei: But I can't say I was expecting you to start crying... It's a little, um, creepy. Kousei: Yeah, I know. I guess I tried too hard to sell it. Mei: Ah! I KNEW you were pretending, you stinker! Mei: Do you really mean that? Kousei: Yeah. I mean it. Seriously. Kousei: I could finish off both these chocolates right here if I'm not careful. Mei: Phew... Kousei: There's no way you could've gone wrong with Suzune-san's recipe. Mei: Yeah, but still... Kousei: Besides, even if it DID taste bad, I'd never say it to your face. Mei: What? So it really DOES taste bad?! Kousei: No, no. It's delicious. Really. Mei: *sigh*... My heart's pounding so much. Like, I've been feeling so anxious lately. That's why I've been acting so weird... Mei: When I was making the chocolate by hand, I began to understand how you feel, Senpai. Mei: Making food for someone else to eat is incredibly stressful and nerve-wracking... Mei: But it's also really fun, trying to make something that the person will like. Mei: And when you do get that confirmation from them that they like it... Mei: It makes you happier than words can describe! Kousei: I already told you. Why don't you believe me? Mei: Because I'm worried! Kousei: Didn't you taste it yourself beforehand? Mei: Well, yeah. I tried one I made from the same batch, but still... Kousei: It was delicious, wasn't it? Mei: It was, but this one's gone all cold! It's not FRESH! Kousei: Even so, it tastes delicious. Mei: Really? Really, really? Kousei: If you're really that worried about the taste, why don't you try some yourself? Kousei: See? I told you. Mei: Phew... Wait. Ah... Ahh! Kousei: What? Mei: Th-Th-Th-That was... an i-i-indirect k-ki--! Kousei: Oh, right. Sorry. You're pretty sensitive about these sorts of things, aren't you? Mei: O-O-Oh, no! It doesn't bothe--well... i-it does, I guess... Kousei: My bad. I totally forgot. Mei: I-I mean... As long as it's you, I... Mei: ...... Mei: U-U-Umm! Kousei: Hm? Mei: Suzune-san told me something... Kousei: Yeah? Mei: She said that you'd be happy receiving any kind of chocolate for Valentine's Day... Kousei: It's true. I'm pretty thrilled right now. Thank you, seriously. Mei: You're welcome... But she also said that... if I gave you handmade chocolate... Mei: Then... Umm... Kousei: Hm? Mei: Then you'd... umm! Kousei: Yeah? Mei: You'd think that... it meant I had genuine feelings for you... Kousei: O-Oh, come on! I can't believe she told you that too! Mei: Y-Yes... That's what she said... Kousei: I, er, I mean... I was only half-joking when I said that... Mei: You were... joking? Kousei: Y-Yeah. I was just messing with her... Kousei: B-But don't worry! I'm not dumb enough to think you like me just because of a couple chocolates! Mei: ...... Mei: I wouldn't mind... if you thought I did... though. Kousei: O-Okay? Kousei: ...... Kousei: Wait, what?! Mei: ...... Kousei: ...... Kousei: ...... Mei: Um... Mei: ...... Mei: During our girls' night out the other day... everyone kept asking me about that time we went to the pool together... Mei: Eventually, the conversation turned to... whether or not I had f-feelings for you, Senpai... Mei: I said I didn't know... but everyone else said it was obvious that I did... Mei: I thought they might be right... but I've never had any sort of romantic experience before... so I wasn't sure. Mei: I can't say I really understand my own feelings... but at the very least, I do know that you're a very important person to me. Mei: That's... what I wanted to tell you today. Mei: But... Mei: ...... Mei: Just now, I realized that... I really do... love you, Senpai. Mei: I mean, love is supposed to make your heart pound, isn't it? But when I'm with you, it's almost the opposite... I feel so relaxed that I thought it couldn't be love. Mei: But right now... my heart is pounding like crazy. Even though all I'm doing is telling you how I feel... my chest feels like it's about to burst. Mei: When I made up my mind to give you these chocolates... and when I decided to ask Suzune-san to teach me how to make them... Mei: While I practiced... This morning... During work... And while I was sitting here waiting for you earlier too... Mei: My heart wouldn't stop pounding. Mei: You wouldn't believe how nervous I felt. Mei: The truth is... I've had feelings for you all this time. Mei: So it's time I worked up the courage to say it. Mei: I... I think I love you, Senpai. Mei: No, wait... That doesn't sound right... Mei: ...... Mei: Senpai... I love you. Mei: I love the way you thank me, even when I've barely done anything... Mei: I love the way you're so nice to me, and lend an ear to all my worries... Mei: And I love so many other things about you too. Mei: So please... Mei: ...... Mei: Please... go out with me. Mei: Please... take me as your girlfriend. Mei: I... want to be with you from now on, Senpai. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Right now... my heart's also hammering like crazy. Kousei: When I thought you were avoiding me... it made me feel so lonely and so worried. Kousei: I was afraid you didn't like me, and I became really depressed. Kousei: Especially when you ran off without giving me any chocolate. Kousei: But then--you messaged to ask if we could meet. My heart wouldn't stop pounding on the way here. Kousei: This whole day's been a roller coaster of emotions for me. Kousei: But if what I'm feeling is the same thing you are... then I'm in love too. Kousei: In love with you, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Ah... Urk... Kousei: I love you too, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: S-So... Kousei: I want you to go out with me. Mei: ...... Mei: Ahhh... Mei: I'm a total mess of emotions right now... Kousei: Me too... My face must be burning up right now. Mei: ...... Kousei: ...... Mei: ...... Kousei: Uh... if you don't mind... Mei: Huh? Kousei: Could I call you by your first name? It'd feel oddly formal... if I kept using your last name. Mei: Y-Yeah, I agree... Go ahead. You don't have to use an honorific either... if you don't want. Kousei: Oh... Mei: Yeah. You can just call me Mei. Kousei: M... M-M-M... Mei: You're stammering so much... Kousei: I-I can't help it. I've never called you this before... Mei: That's fine. I can be patient. Kousei: M-Mei... Mei: There you go. Ehehe... Kousei: What about you? Mei: Huh? Kousei: Will you start calling me by my name? Mei: Senpai? Kousei: That's not what it says on my birth certificate. Mei: Urk... Mei: ...... Mei: Kousei... san? Kousei: You can drop the honorific too. Mei: Well... I mean, I'm younger than you, so... Mei: But maybe I could call you Kou-kun instead-- Mei: No, wait. That's even more embarrassing. Kousei: Yeah... That's pretty embarrassing for me too. Mei: Well, for now... I'm only going to use your first name when we're alone together. Kousei: A-Alright. I guess we wouldn't want the others to tease us about it. Mei: E-Exactly. Kousei: ...... Mei: ...... Kousei: Y-Yeah. I mean, if that's okay with you... Mei: O-Of course it is! Mei: ...... Mei: Finally... I'm your girlfriend! "

Pedestrian A: Mhh, these are great! Kanna: Thank you very much! Once we open for business, we'll be selling a variety of other cakes and baked good as well, so come check us out, if you're interested! Pedestrian A: Hmm... Natsume: W-We hope to see you there! Pedestrian B: Huh? Oh, um, sure! Natsume: If you'd like, please try one of our free samples too! Pedestrian B: A-Alright... Kousei: Oh, hello. You're, er, that employee from Patisserie Sourian, right? Cake Store Worker: Yes. Cake Store Worker: Not at all. I didn't do anything, really. But, umm, I have to ask. Cake Store Worker: How is Shioyama-san doing? Kousei: She's doing just fine. In fact, she's already found a new job. Kousei: She's the one who baked that madeleine you have. Cake Store Worker: What? So she works at this cafe? Kousei: Yep. We're planning to open next week. Cake Store Worker: Really? I had no idea. Kousei: We'll have other freshly-baked sweets and pancakes on opening day, if you're interested. Cake Store Worker: I may just have to stop by then. But anyway, I'd better get going. Kousei: I hope to see you there next week. Cake Store Worker: Of course. Suzune: They should be cool enough now. Suzune: There we go. Phew, looking good. Very good. Here's your strawberry tartlet. What do you think? Suzune: For the last time... It doesn't LOOK delicious; it IS delicious. Mei: Well, I certainly bet it is, but since I haven't tasted it yet, I can't say for sure, can I? Mei: So having said that, let me have a teensy tiny little bite of-- Nozomi: Hands off, missy. You can have some AFTER we take some pictures. Don't forget; this is for our Instogram. Mei: Ahaha! Sorry! Kousei: Alright, let's do this. Nozomi: I guess they don't pay professional photographers for nothing. The pictures they use on restaurant menus usually look way more appetizing. Suzune: This photo, um, actually makes it looks rather UN-appetizing. Or is that just me? Kousei: No, you're definitely right. Not that I can really say anything, since I'm the one who took it. Kousei: I'll try taking a few more and see if we get a lucky shot. Mei: Wait, Senpai! I have a suggestion. Why don't we try switching locations? Kousei: What would that do? Mei: There's a special trick to taking delicious pictures of food, you see. Mei: Ah--not to say the tart doesn't look delicious as it is, of course. It most certainly does. Suzune: Good save. Mei: Phew... So, as I was saying, some girls in my class taught me this super cool trick when taking food pictures! Kousei: Okay. I'm listening. Mei: Allow me to explain! Mei: From what I'm told, you want to take pictures somewhere with a lot of light. Near a windowsill, for example. Kousei: Oh. Mei: Next, you remove any unnecessary objects. Hands, flowers, whatever--get 'em all out of the shot. Mei: The object should be photographed close up, at an angle. Also, it shouldn't necessarily be dead-center in the image, but a little off to the side. Kousei: Interesting. Nozomi: I tried asking around too, and apparently there are a ton of easy-to-use apps that allow you to enhance photos. Mei: Oh, right! My friends also recommended me some photo-editing apps we could use. Nozomi: The girls in your class are pretty knowledgeable about this stuff, huh? Mei: They all love taking selfies. Mei: Both the really girly girls like you, Nozomi-chan, and even girls that act like sleazy old men. And especially the ones addicted to Instogram. Kousei: Well, either way, I'm glad we have you, Hiuchidani-san. Kousei: Without your guidance, we'd be stuck with these crappy pictures I took. Mei: Well, don't thank me just yet... Ka-chik. Mei: How's that look? Suzune: That's amazing. Just look at how shiny the glaze is. Nozomi: Oh my gosh! Nozomi: Kousei-kun's picture actually looks kind of gross when compared to this. Kousei: I'd have to agree. Mei: I can't believe it either. This turned out way better than I thought it would. Mei: I'll send this pic to my friends and ask them what they think. Kousei: Good idea. Let us know what they say. Mei: Aye, aye. Nozomi: How many followers do we have on Instogram right now, by the way? Mei: Barely any. But, I mean, we've only posted a couple basic announcements. Kousei: Still, it's above zero, isn't it? Nozomi: Yeah. As long as we have some, then we know our flyers worked to some extent. Kousei: I wonder if there's anything we can do to get more followers? Mei: There's no special trick, really. You just gotta put in the effort. Mei: Which means posting tons of pretty pictures, and including all the right hashtags so people can find them. Kousei: Ah, okay. Kousei: So you're saying we'll naturally gain more followers if we keep posting more pics of the cakes Suzune-san bakes for us? Suzune: Don't pin this all on me. Our menu also includes pancakes, omelet rice, pasta, coffee, and tea too, in case you've forgotten. Suzune: In my opinion, we should start by photographing all the items on our menu. Mei: Oh, good idea. Let's do that first. Suzune: So make sure you cook up your best for us, okay? Kousei: I'll try. Nozomi: I know it's important to upload pictures of our food, but don't you think it'd feel a little bland if that's ALL we post? Nozomi: Maybe we could post some casual photos every now and then? Or would that be unprofessional? Kousei: I don't think it's a bad idea. Kousei: Posting a variety of pictures might help us gain more followers. As long as we do it in moderation. Mei: Oh! My friends mentioned that too. Apparently, pictures of cats get a lot of impressions. Kousei: Hmm. Mei: Yeah, I suppose we can't just pick some stray cat off the street. Oh--one of my friends responded! Mei: \"Whoa! That looks delish! I'll definitely come order that once you guys open,\" she says! Mission success! Mei: Oh, there's more! \"Try angling it to the side a bit, and zooming in a little closer.\" Nozomi: Seriously? I thought we already had it pretty close. Mei: I guess we wanna eliminate as much of the unnecessary stuff in the background as possible. Hmm. Like this, maybe? Nozomi: Nice! That's gotta be perfect. Mei: Let's do one more. Suzune: Well, I'll leave you girls to it. Once you're done, feel free to eat the tart. Mei: You don't have to tell us twice! Suzune: You're coming with me, Kousei. We're making pancakes to take pictures of next. Kousei: Yes, ma'am! "

            "Suzune: Crud. Looks like I'm all out of beer. Mei: Would you like some tea? I haven't drunk directly out of this one yet. Suzune: Sure. By the way, these kelp rolls are delicious. Mei: Hehe. I'll be sure to let my grandma know. Have as many as you want! Suzune: Hey, Kousei! Is it ready yet? I'm already getting full from all these kelp rolls! Kousei: Sorry for the wait. I just finished now. Mei: But you added some kind of smoked ingredient, didn't you? Kousei: You'll see. Go ahead and try it. Suzune: Uh-huh. Mei: ...... Suzune: ...... Mei: Oh? Suzune: Something tastes different. It's a lot more fragrant when I bite into it. Mei: It can't be the bacon, right? Where's this smoky flavor coming from? Suzune: It doesn't seem to be the vegetables, either... What exactly did you do? Kousei: It's the black pepper. That's what I smoked. Mei: Ohh! It's the seasoning! Kousei: Yeah. In a way, black pepper is actually the main ingredient in carbonara. That's where the name of the dish comes from, in fact. Suzune: It's derived from the Italian word for charcoal burner, right? Because there's supposed to be so much pepper on it that it turns black. Kousei: Exactly. I was contemplating whether or not to smoke the salt, but I thought that would change the flavor too much. Kousei: So I decided to smoke the pepper instead. This way it adds a nice kick without destroying the balance of the dish. Suzune: You're right. It really does add a nice kick. It's amazing how a small addition can make such a big difference. Suzune: Even though the seasoning is fundamentally the same, the flavor has a lot more depth. Mei: This is amazing! Just like authentic carbonara! Not that I know what authentic carbonara tastes like, but still! Kousei: Glad you like it. I only just finished smoking the pepper, so the smell might be a little harsh-- Kousei: But as long as I let it sit for a while, it should disappear. Then all I need to do is mix it with some regular black pepper to fine tune the flavor. Suzune: Sounds good. It could use a bit of adjusting, but I definitely think this is good enough to serve to our customers. In all honesty, this really is delicious. Kousei: Thanks. What about you-- Mei: Phew! That was good! Kousei: Wow. Not even a crumb left. Mei: It was too good! Just like real Italian cuisine! Not that I know what real Italian cuisine tastes like, but still! Suzune: You already said that earlier. I get what you're trying to say, though. Kousei: Ahaha... I wasn't expecting this much of a reaction. I'm flattered. Mei: Seriously, it was delicious! You're a genius, Senpai! Kousei: O-Oh stop it... Suzune: Well, since Mei-san is showering you in praise, I'm going to be a little more critical. Suzune: Like you said before, the dish still needs some balancing. Kousei: I know. It's got a pretty strong flavor, so I'm gonna try letting it mellow overnight next time. Suzune: Instead of trying to figure out everything on your own, though, you should ask the others at the cafe to taste-test your dish first. Suzune: Then you can decide if you want to tone it down, or if you actually want to emphasize that distinct flavor. Mei: Ohh, I see! The more unique it tastes, the more likely it is to grab people's interest! Suzune: Exactly. But you might get differing opinions on which one is better, which'll make it harder to decide. Suzune: Still, it's up to you. At the very least, I don't think anyone's going to object to you adding this dish to our menu. Kousei: Alright. I'll give it a shot. Kousei: And thanks, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Huh? Kousei: I wouldn't have come up with this idea without you, so thanks. Mei: Please! All I did was suggest the first thing that came to mind. Mei: Don't underestimate your own genius, Senpai! This really is amazing! Kousei: Th-Thanks. Suzune: Ahem. Kousei: Wh-What? Suzune: We're all out of cheese and sausages, so I'm gonna need you to make me some more. Kousei: You already ate them all? I wanted some too, you know. Suzune: Oh, stop griping. C'mon! Kousei: Alright, alright. Fine. Mei: Senpai! I want to try smoking some other things too! Kousei: Sure. I'll rummage around my fridge and see what else we can toss in the smoker. Mei: This is gonna be great! Kanna: Here's to another great year! Let's all do our best! Suzune: Alrighty. Ready to get back to work? Kousei: Yes, ma'am. Kousei: Not so much changed as added a new twist. I tried smoking the pepper first. Natsume: I can't say it looks or smells particularly different, though... Kousei: You'll see once you try it. Nozomi: Well, I'm gonna go ahead and dig in! Nozomi: That faint hint of smokiness... It's amazing how much difference it makes. Natsume: You said you smoked it yourself? Kousei: Yep. It was all Hiuchidani-san's idea. Mei: Don't be silly. You came up with the idea to smoke the black pepper. Mei: All I did was suggest that we try to make our own bacon. Natsume: Ah. So you spent the break thinking up ways to improve our menu... Natsume: That's very commendable of you. I'm impressed. Kousei: Thanks. How do you think it tastes? Kanna: I, for one, think it's delicious. It gives the dish a lot more added depth. Nozomi: I think so too. This seems like it'd be a real crowd-pleaser. Natsume: It certainly is delicious, but... Kousei: But? Natsume: I feel like the pepper's unique smokiness has a sort of... mature taste to it. Natsume: It's definitely not bad by any means, but--and this is just my personal opinion... Natsume: But I think I actually prefer the regular carbonara. Natsume: So while I'm all for adding this to our menu, I don't think it should replace the original version. Nozomi: You said you added the smoked black pepper to the pasta at the end, right? Kousei: Yeah, I did. Nozomi: In that case, why don't we just serve our regular carbonara with a shaker of smoked black pepper on the side? Nozomi: That way, customers can add as much or as little as they want. Natsume: How would we know how much to prepare in advance, though? Some customers might use a lot more than others. Suzune: A lot of beef bowl restaurants used to do the same thing with their special shichimi spices, but they had to stop the practice a little while back. Suzune: Some customers were using unbelievable amounts of spice, which ended up hurting their profits. Nozomi: Oh... I guess that won't work then. Kanna: It seems like our safest option would be to add this smoked pepper version as a separate item on the menu. Kousei: Alright. So I have all the judges' approval? Kanna: Absolutely. I think this would make a fine addition to our menu. Nozomi: Me too. Natsume: Me three. Kanna: What do you think, Mikado-san? Mikado: I believe Natsume mentioned earlier that this dish had a rather mature taste. However, many of our customers also come here specifically for our coffee and tea. Mikado: Judging from what I have gathered, this would suit their preferences well. Mikado: Therefore, I am in agreement. Kousei: Thank goodness... Mei: Way to go, Senpai! Kousei: Thanks! Kousei: I was just gonna do it at home, actually... Mikado: Among other problems, that would be quite expensive. I would not recommend you do that. Kousei: I guess that's true. Mikado: I do have some other ideas you may wish to consider. Are you free to talk after this? Kousei: Sure. I've got time. Kanna: In that case, let's call it a day here. See you tomorrow, everyone. Natsume: See you tomorrow. Nozomi: See you tomorrow! Kousei: Phew... Kousei: Huh? Hiuchidani-san? Mei: Hey. Kousei: What are you still doing here? Mei: I was waiting for you to finish. Kousei: You could've waited inside. Mei: Ahaha. I didn't want to bother you guys. Mei: Anyway, I know I should've said something earlier... but would you mind walking me home? Kousei: Sure. I don't mind. Let's go. Mei: Thanks! Mei: Congratulations on getting your new recipe approved, by the way. Kousei: Well, you helped with that. Mei: Not at all. You did this on your own, Senpai. Kousei: Nah, it's all thanks to you. I would've never come up with this idea on my own. Kousei: Seriously, thank you. I'm really grateful. Kousei: This might sound kind of melodramatic... but I think I've gained a little more confidence in myself now. Mei: Ehehe... You're gonna make me blush. I don't mean to sound melodramatic either, but, like... Mei: You've done a lot for me as well, Senpai. Ever since you've helped me open up about my left eye, I feel like a huge weight's been lifted off my shoulders. Mei: That's why I wanted to be able to return the favor if I could. Mei: I'm glad I managed to be of some small help to you. Kousei: It wasn't small at all. You were a big help. Kousei: I was hoping to do something like this before I had to deal with my exams, so I'm glad it all went so well. Mei: Oh, your exams are coming up? Kousei: At the end of the month, yeah. Mei: Does that mean you're gonna be working fewer hours? Kousei: No, I'll be working the same as usual. I'll do fine as long as I pay attention in class. Kousei: And I can always study after work too. Mei: You're a pretty diligent student, aren't you? Kousei: I don't know about that... I'm just the sort of guy who hates procrastinating. Mei: That's what it means to be diligent, Senpai. I think that's something to be proud of. Kousei: Nah, trust me... I can be pretty lazy when I want. Mei: But in front of me, at least, you're always hardworking and dependable. Kousei: Okay, sheesh. Stop flattering me. It's gonna go to my head. Mei: Ahaha! Alright. Mei: Well, good night, Senpai. Kousei: Good night. And sorry you had to wait for me earlier. Mei: That's okay. I waited because I wanted to congratulate you. Mei: Anyway, see you tomorrow! Kousei: Yeah. See you tomorrow. Mei: ...... Mei: Hmm... Exams... "

Natsume: As for the rest of us, we're thinking of opening up a food stall for the festival. Suzune: A food stall? Wait--in three days?! Mikado: Yes. We would like you to devise a menu for it. Mikado: Think of it as a way of establishing friendly ties with the community. For a small, local business like ours, these acts of community engagement are often necessary. Suzune: I get what you're saying, but still. What kind of food would we even sell at a stall? Suzune: Naturally. This isn't going to be a restaurant; our customers won't be able to sit down to enjoy their food. Kousei: Couldn't we just sell something easy to eat while walking like takoyaki or chocolate bananas?

Mei: Hehe. I'll be sure to let my grandma know. Have as many as you want! Suzune: Hey, Kousei! Is it ready yet? I'm already getting full from all these kelp rolls! Kousei: Sorry for the wait. I just finished now. Mei: But you added some kind of smoked ingredient, didn't you? Kousei: You'll see. Go ahead and try it. Suzune: Uh-huh. Mei: ...... Suzune: ...... Mei: Oh? Suzune: Something tastes different. It's a lot more fragrant when I bite into it. Mei: It can't be the bacon, right? Where's this smoky flavor coming from? Suzune: It doesn't seem to be the vegetables, either... What exactly did you do? Kousei: It's the black pepper. That's what I smoked. Mei: Ohh! It's the seasoning! Kousei: Yeah. In a way, black pepper is actually the main ingredient in carbonara. That's where the name of the dish comes from, in fact. Suzune: It's derived from the Italian word for charcoal burner, right? Because there's supposed to be so much pepper on it that it turns black. Kousei: Exactly. I was contemplating whether or not to smoke the salt, but I thought that would change the flavor too much. Kousei: So I decided to smoke the pepper instead. This way it adds a nice kick without destroying the balance of the dish. Suzune: You're right. It really does add a nice kick. It's amazing how a small addition can make such a big difference. Suzune: Even though the seasoning is fundamentally the same, the flavor has a lot more depth. Mei: This is amazing! Just like authentic carbonara! Not that I know what authentic carbonara tastes like, but still! Kousei: Glad you like it. I only just finished smoking the pepper, so the smell might be a little harsh-- Kousei: But as long as I let it sit for a while, it should disappear. Then all I need to do is mix it with some regular black pepper to fine tune the flavor. Suzune: Sounds good. It could use a bit of adjusting, but I definitely think this is good enough to serve to our customers. In all honesty, this really is delicious. Kousei: Thanks. What about you-- Mei: Phew! That was good! Kousei: Wow. Not even a crumb left. Mei: It was too good! Just like real Italian cuisine! Not that I know what real Italian cuisine tastes like, but still! Suzune: You already said that earlier. I get what you're trying to say, though. Kousei: Ahaha... I wasn't expecting this much of a reaction. I'm flattered. Mei: Seriously, it was delicious! You're a genius, Senpai! Kousei: O-Oh stop it... Suzune: Well, since Mei-san is showering you in praise, I'm going to be a little more critical. Suzune: Like you said before, the dish still needs some balancing. Kousei: I know. It's got a pretty strong flavor, so I'm gonna try letting it mellow overnight next time. Suzune: Instead of trying to figure out everything on your own, though, you should ask the others at the cafe to taste-test your dish first. Suzune: Then you can decide if you want to tone it down, or if you actually want to emphasize that distinct flavor. Mei: Ohh, I see! The more unique it tastes, the more likely it is to grab people's interest! Suzune: Exactly. But you might get differing opinions on which one is better, which'll make it harder to decide.

Natsume: See you tomorrow. Nozomi: See you tomorrow! Kousei: Phew... Kousei: Huh? Hiuchidani-san? Mei: Hey. Kousei: What are you still doing here? Mei: I was waiting for you to finish. Kousei: You could've waited inside. Mei: Ahaha. I didn't want to bother you guys. Mei: Anyway, I know I should've said something earlier... but would you mind walking me home? Kousei: Sure. I don't mind. Let's go. Mei: Thanks! Mei: Congratulations on getting your new recipe approved, by the way. Kousei: Well, you helped with that. Mei: Not at all. You did this on your own, Senpai. Kousei: Nah, it's all thanks to you. I would've never come up with this idea on my own. Kousei: Seriously, thank you. I'm really grateful. Kousei: This might sound kind of melodramatic... but I think I've gained a little more confidence in myself now. Mei: Ehehe... You're gonna make me blush. I don't mean to sound melodramatic either, but, like... Mei: You've done a lot for me as well, Senpai. Ever since you've helped me open up about my left eye, I feel like a huge weight's been lifted off my shoulders. Mei: That's why I wanted to be able to return the favor if I could. Mei: I'm glad I managed to be of some small help to you. Kousei: It wasn't small at all. You were a big help. Kousei: I was hoping to do something like this before I had to deal with my exams, so I'm glad it all went so well. Mei: Oh, your exams are coming up? Kousei: At the end of the month, yeah. Mei: Does that mean you're gonna be working fewer hours? Kousei: No, I'll be working the same as usual. I'll do fine as long as I pay attention in class. Kousei: And I can always study after work too. Mei: You're a pretty diligent student, aren't you? Kousei: I don't know about that... I'm just the sort of guy who hates procrastinating. Mei: That's what it means to be diligent, Senpai. I think that's something to be proud of. Kousei: Nah, trust me... I can be pretty lazy when I want. Mei: But in front of me, at least, you're always hardworking and dependable. Kousei: Okay, sheesh. Stop flattering me. It's gonna go to my head. Mei: Ahaha! Alright. Mei: Well, good night, Senpai. Kousei: Good night. And sorry you had to wait for me earlier. Mei: That's okay. I waited because I wanted to congratulate you. Mei: Anyway, see you tomorrow! Kousei: Yeah. See you tomorrow. Mei: ...... Mei: Hmm... Exams... "

            "Female Student A: So tell us! Where'd you meet this boyfriend of yours? Female Student B: What do you like about him anyway? Not that I'm trying to say he's bad--I'm just curious. Natsume: Kousei and I work at the same cafe. As for what I like about him... Natsume: Well, I enjoy being with him. Despite how he looks, he can also be pretty manly. But I guess I'd say the thing I like most about him is-- Student C: Is? Natsume: Honestly, I'm not sure. Natsume: But I love him a lot. All Three: Ahhh! Female Student B: Ohmigosh, you're SOOO adorable! Student C: You're head over heels for him, aren't you? Female Student A: So does that mean you're the one who asked him out? Natsume: Hmm. It's kind of hard to say. Technically, he's the one who confessed to me. Natsume: But I did kiss him before that. Student C: You kissed before you even started dating? Whoa, girl! Natsume: W-Well, you know. We were watching the sunrise on New Year's, and I got swept up in the moment... Female Student B: Oh, wow. So you two really haven't been going out for long. Student C: So did you guys do the deed outside after that kiss? Natsume: N-No, we didn't! Female Student B: Are you stupid? It's way too cold around this time of year to be having sex outdoors. Female Student A: So you're saying it'd be fine if it were summertime?! Student C: Sorry, Shiki-san! Are we making you uncomfortable? Natsume: No, not particularly... Female Student B: Wait. Are you still a virgin, by any chance? Female Student A: Oh my gosh! Have a little more tact, will you? Natsume: It's fine... Um, I'm not a virgin anymore. All Three: Whoa! Female Student A: You gotta tell us! How was it? Natsume: W-Well, it hurt. Student C: Not surprising. Natsume: But it felt good too. Female Student B: Really? Student C: Your boyfriend--um, Takamine-kun, was it? Has he been with a lot of other girls before you? Natsume: I doubt it. He said it was his first time too. Female Student B: Y'know, when I lost my virginity, I bled like hell. Female Student A: So the blood part is true? Student C: Wait, are you... Female Student A: Urk... Y-Yeah, I'm still a virgin! So what?! Female Student B: Hey, I never said there was anything wrong with that! Better to stay a virgin than to get impatient, throw it away, and end up with a crappy experience. Student C: Yep. You want your first time to be something memorable. Don't you agree, Shiki-san? Natsume: Huh? O-Oh, yeah. It definitely hurt, but it was a really wonderful experience. All Three: Whoa... Natsume: I-I mean, yeah, I agree--you shouldn't just throw away your virginity. Female Student A: A-Alright. I guess I'll just wait for the right guy to come along. Female Student A: Still, I'm kinda scared. Out of curiosity, how bad does it hurt? Female Student B: It's kinda hard to put into words, honestly. It was like an \"Eek!\" if that makes sense. Student C: For me, it was more like... \"Hngh!\" Female Student A: Pretty bad, I take it... Female Student A: What about you, Shiki-san? Natsume: For me, I guess it was only about an \"Ouch!\"... Female Student B: Lucky you. Female Student A: Is there some way to make it hurt less? Natsume: I have no idea. I'm not exactly an expert myself. Student C: Foreplay's probably the most important thing, don't you think? Student C: Then again, some guys have dicks so big it doesn't matter how wet you are. Female Student B: Yeah. Ultimately, it's gonna depend on your partner. Some guys are way too horny and wanna put it in without any foreplay, for example. Female Student A: What should I do if that happens? Student C: Hmm. You could make him cum once, and hopefully that calms him down some. Female Student A: Yeah, but how? Student C: With a handjob or a blowjob. Female Student A: A handjob? Natsume: A blowjob... Student C: You could also go for a thighjob, or an armpitjob--or get creative and go for a hairjob, a footjob, or even a shoulder-blade-job. Female Student B: Sheesh. You've done it all, haven't you? Wait--shoulder blades?! How does that even work?! Student C: What do you mean? You just--wait a minute. Student C: Are you interested in trying out some of this stuff too, Shiki-san? Natsume: Yesn't. Female Student A: What? Was that a yes or a no? Female Student B: Correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like a yes to me! Natsume: Have a good day. Kanna: Good job today, guys. Natsume: Yeah. You too. Suzune: It's been a while now since New Year's, but how are the numbers looking? Kanna: Thankfully, the number of customers hasn't declined in the slightest. Natsume: In fact, we might be getting even more than before, thanks to your Mont Blanc. Suzune: Wow, really? I'm glad all that effort paid off then. Kousei: Must've been a lot of work. Suzune: Well, y'know. It's not easy steaming chestnuts, hollowing them out, then straining them. And you gotta do everything by hand, otherwise the aroma and the texture just won't be the same. Kousei: Should I start coming to work a bit earlier to help out? Suzune: Wow. I thought you hated waking up early. Kousei: I do, but I can deal with it if you need the help. Suzune: Well, I kinda hate to ask you to... Kousei: Why's that? Suzune: You've seem kind of worn out these past few days, if you know what I mean. Kousei: ...... Kousei: I've, uh... been doing a lot of studying. My finals are coming up. Suzune: Well, as someone who lives in the same apartment building, let me give you a bit of advice. You might want to try keeping your voice down while you're \"studying.\" Kousei: ...... Natsume: Don't look at me, idiot. Her room is way too far away from yours; there's no way she'd be able to hear us. Kousei: Ah... Suzune: Hehehe. Well, all jokes aside. Suzune: I appreciate the offer, but I shouldn't be making other employees do extra work. If there's a problem, it's the system that needs to be improved. Kousei: You say that, but you're the one who always ends up doing the brunt of the work, Suzune-san... Suzune: Well, I guess that's just the price I pay for doing things my way. Either way, I shouldn't be pushing the responsibility onto the part-timers. Suzune: You've got exams coming up, don't you? Are you feeling confident about those? I wouldn't want to be responsible for your graduation being pushed back a year. Kousei: Don't worry. Despite what you may think of me, I do take my classes seriously. Natsume: I'm confident enough that I won't need to do any last-minute cramming either. Suzune: Great. Kanna: Still, let us know if you need time off. We'll do our best to handle things here on our own. Natsume: Thanks. I appreciate it. Kousei: So, where to today? Your place, or mine? Natsume: Hmm. Let's go to your place. I want to warm up under your kotatsu. Kousei: Alright. Kousei: I still have some hotpot ingredients leftover from last time too. Natsume: Sounds good. Let's have that. Kousei: Man, they were delicious. Natsume: If I make them, I'll probably end up making a lot, so let's save it for next time, and invite the others over. Kousei: Alright. Kousei: But speaking of which--what ever happened to that qipao you wore during New Year's? Natsume: What is it with you and your cosplay fetish? Kousei: I'm sorry, but you just looked way too cute in it. Kousei: Not to say that you don't normally look cute, because you do. Every day. Natsume: Alright, fine. I'll wear it for you next time, if I'm in the mood. Natsume: Phew. That was good. Kousei: Yep. Natsume: Here, let me clean up. Kousei: Nah, I'll do it today. Natsume: You sure? Well, how about I make us a cup of coffee or tea then? Kousei: Hmm. I could definitely go for a cup of coffee. Kousei: But all I have is the instant stuff. Natsume: Where is it? Kousei: Oh, it's on that shelf up there. The tea's up there too. Only tea bags, though. Natsume: Nope. I'm just waiting for the tea to steep. Kousei: You have to steep tea bags too? Natsume: You don't have to, but the tea's a lot more fragrant this way. Kousei: Huh. Well, I'll be waiting over here. Natsume: Okay. Kousei: Phew. Sure is cold tonight. Kousei: Rokurou-san did seem pretty happy with how things turned out. Natsume: What's that? Kousei: Nothing. Just talking to myself. Natsume: Oh. Well, here's your coffee. Kousei: Sorry I only have tea bags for you. Natsume: I don't really mind. Anyway, scooch over. I need to warm myself up too. Kousei: O-Oh, uh, okay... Kousei: Not much space, though. Natsume: What, do you want me to move? Kousei: I never said that. Kousei: You just don't, err, initiate this sort of... physical intimacy very often. Kousei: It's usually me who does it. Natsume: The only thing you initiate is se... sex, Kousei. Kousei: I won't deny that. But I do like cuddling like this too. Kousei: Especially when you're the one seeking it, Natsume. Natsume: Only because I love you. Natsume: There's nothing I enjoy more than being with my boyfriend. Being able to feel you right next to me is the most blissful thing ever. Kousei: Same for me. Natsume: I can tell. You've had that goofy grin on your face for a while now. "

Maybe up the order limit to twenty-five. Kanna: Sounds good. Anyway, I'm sure you can guess why I've asked you two to stay behind. Mei: This is about my eye again, isn't it? Kanna: We just want to know how things are progressing, so this shouldn't take too much of your time. Has anything changed with your eye since we last spoke? Mei: No. I still don't know how to release my butterflies... Kanna: Not to worry. I'm certain you'll get there eventually. Mikado: Our main purpose in opening this cafe has always been to collect butterflies. Thanks to you, that task has been proceeding expeditiously. Mikado: Allow me to thank you for your hard work once again. We owe you our gratitude. Mei: A-All I'm doing is catching butterflies. I'd wouldn't exactly call that \"hard work\"... Mei: B-But either way, I'll continue to do my best to help! Mikado: Thank you. We appreciate it. Mei: ...... Mikado: But while I appreciate your efforts, I will not be transforming into a cat. Mei: Okay. I'm sorry. Kanna: Allow me to thank you as well, Takamine-san. Kousei: Huh? Why me? Kanna: While it was mere coincidence that brought you here to work with us, you've become an invaluable member of our team. Kanna: Many of our customers even come to our cafe specifically to eat your dishes now. Kanna: So thank you very much. You've been an incredible help to us all. Kousei: Well, I mean... this was all because of that \"problem\" I had with my soul in the first place... Kousei: But I'm glad you appreciate me. Honestly, this job has been pretty fulfilling for me too lately. Mikado: Indeed. It would appear your soul's condition has been greatly improving. Kanna: You can't let your guard down just yet, but as long as you keep heading in the right direction, you won't have anything to worry about. Kousei: Phew. That's a relief to hear. I owe it all to Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Huh? Kousei: Thanks for guiding me in the right direction. Mei: N-No, I didn't do anything. Kousei: You did. Thank you for everything. Mei: I-I... Mei: ...... Mei: U-Um, was there anything else you wanted to discuss? Kanna: No, I believe that's it. Mei: In that case, I've got something I need to do, so--! Mikado: Alright. Then we apologize for keeping you. Mei: That's okay! Anyway, I'll be going now! Kousei: Let me walk you-- Mei: Good night! Kousei: Huh? Kousei: Y-Yeah, I am... Kanna: Good night. Kousei: Yeah. Good night... Kousei: ...... Kousei: I should've known... Mei: Y-You're fine. Kousei: Freaking out? Mei: Y-Yeah... I... Um... Mei: ...... Mei: Oh, gosh... I'm so nervous... Mei: U-Umm... I think it would take too long to explain myself, so... h-here! Mei: Yes. It's... my Valentine's Day gift... to you. Kousei: Chocolate! Mei: Y-Yes. It's chocolate, and it's, um... handmade. Kousei: Handmade! Mei: Wow, you're really excited about this... Suzune-san taught me how to make it, so it should taste alright... I think. Kousei: Oh... Is that why you've been going home together lately? Mei: Yeah. I've been going to her apartment so she could teach me. Mei: She's also been helping me by asking you about your preferences and stuff... Kousei: My preferences? Oh, wait. Mei: Ahaha... Sorry. I guess I just felt kind of embarrassed... Kousei: Is that why the others said they weren't giving me any chocolate this year? So this would be a surprise? Mei: What? I don't know anything about that... Mei: But the others knew I was planning on giving you my own chocolate, so... I guess that could be why they did that... Kousei: Phew. I thought for sure you hated me or something... Mei: Wh-What?! Of course not! Why would you think that? Kousei: I mean, you've been avoiding me lately, haven't you? Mei: I-I wasn't... I mean... Well, maybe a little... Kousei: See? Mei: That's only because I didn't want you to find out I was preparing chocolate for you... Mei: But... I'm sorry for acting so weird. I didn't mean to give you the wrong idea. Kousei: It's alright. I've been really anxious these past few days, so it's a relief to know the truth. Mei: Urk... I'm sorry... Kousei: Handmade chocolate, though... This is more than I expected. Thank you. Mei: Um, if you'd like... you're welcome to go ahead and eat it... Kousei: Right now? Mei: Yeah. I actually brought you a fork too. Kousei: To be honest, I was planning to go home and savor it there... Mei: N-No, please! You can't! You can't keep me waiting that long! Mei: My heart's already pounding so fast it's about to explode! Mei: I need to know how you think it tastes right now... or else I'm going to die! Kousei: A-Alright. I'll have a bite... Mei: Please do! There are two inside, so at least try one of them! Right now! Mei: Something like that. It's called a chocolate fondant. Kousei: Sounds fancy. Was it hard to make? Mei: Not at all. Suzune-san was there to guide me through every single step. Mei: Ah, but just for the record--I made this all by myself! And I think I did a pretty good job! Mei: Though, um... it was a lot crispier on the outside when it came out of the oven, but it might be a bit soggy by now. Mei: But it shouldn't taste bad! This was Suzune-san's own personal recipe! I baked it with the utmost care! Mei: The flavor should be to your liking as well! So p-please, go ahead and try some! Kousei: Alright... don't mind if I do then. Mei: H-Help yourself! Kousei: ...... Mei: H-Hello? Kousei: ...... Mei: Senpai? Kousei: ...... Mei: Um... Does it... taste bad? Kousei: It's delicious. Mei: R-Really? Oh, thank goodness! Kousei: Oh god... It's so delicious... Mei: Wait, what? Huh? Kousei: How? How can something taste THIS good?! Mei: O-Oh, come on... You're exaggerating... Kousei: *sniffle*... Mei: Wait, are you crying? You're not pretending, are you? No way. Like, seriously? You're seriously crying? Kousei: I can't help it... Mei: O-Okay? Kousei: Everyone kept saying they wouldn't be giving me any chocolate... Mei: Oh... right. They said it'd be a hassle to get return gifts for everyone. Kousei: Even Nozomi, who usually gives me chocolates every year... gave me nothing. Mei: Wait, every year? Oh, right. You and Nozomi-chan are childhood friends. Kousei: Yeah, but she said she'd only been giving them to me out of force of habit... Mei: Oh... Err... I'm not sure what to say to that. Kousei: In the end, the only person who gave me chocolates was you... And handmade chocolate too... Kousei: Thank you... Thank you, Hiuchidani-san! Mei: I didn't think you'd be THIS emotional... but I'm glad you like it. Mei: But I can't say I was expecting you to start crying... It's a little, um, creepy. Kousei: Yeah, I know. I guess I tried too hard to sell it. Mei: Ah! I KNEW you were pretending, you stinker! Mei: Do you really mean that? Kousei: Yeah. I mean it. Seriously. Kousei: I could finish off both these chocolates right here if I'm not careful. Mei: Phew... Kousei: There's no way you could've gone wrong with Suzune-san's recipe. Mei: Yeah, but still... Kousei: Besides, even if it DID taste bad, I'd never say it to your face. Mei: What? So it really DOES taste bad?! Kousei: No, no. It's delicious. Really. Mei: *sigh*... My heart's pounding so much. Like, I've been feeling so anxious lately. That's why I've been acting so weird... Mei: When I was making the chocolate by hand, I began to understand how you feel, Senpai. Mei: Making food for someone else to eat is incredibly stressful and nerve-wracking... Mei: But it's also really fun, trying to make something that the person will like. Mei: And when you do get that confirmation from them that they like it... Mei: It makes you happier than words can describe! Kousei: I already told you. Why don't you believe me? Mei: Because I'm worried! Kousei: Didn't you taste it yourself beforehand? Mei: Well, yeah. I tried one I made from the same batch, but still... Kousei: It was delicious, wasn't it? Mei: It was, but this one's gone all cold! It's not FRESH! Kousei: Even so, it tastes delicious. Mei: Really? Really, really? Kousei: If you're really that worried about the taste, why don't you try some yourself? Kousei: See? I told you. Mei: Phew... Wait. Ah... Ahh! Kousei: What? Mei: Th-Th-Th-That was... an i-i-indirect k-ki--! Kousei: Oh, right. Sorry. You're pretty sensitive about these sorts of things, aren't you? Mei: O-O-Oh, no! It doesn't bothe--well... i-it does, I guess... Kousei: My bad. I totally forgot. Mei: I-I mean... As long as it's you, I... Mei: ...... Mei: U-U-Umm! Kousei: Hm? Mei: Suzune-san told me something... Kousei: Yeah? Mei: She said that you'd be happy receiving any kind of chocolate for Valentine's Day... Kousei: It's true. I'm pretty thrilled right now. Thank you, seriously. Mei: You're welcome... But she also said that... if I gave you handmade chocolate... Mei: Then... Umm... Kousei: Hm? Mei: Then you'd... umm! Kousei: Yeah? Mei: You'd think that... it meant I had genuine feelings for you... Kousei: O-Oh, come on! I can't believe she told you that too! Mei: Y-Yes... That's what she said... Kousei: I, er, I mean... I was only half-joking when I said that... Mei: You were... joking? Kousei: Y-Yeah. I was just messing with her... Kousei: B-But don't worry! I'm not dumb enough to think you like me just because of a couple chocolates! Mei: ...... Mei: I wouldn't mind... if you thought I did... though. Kousei: O-Okay? Kousei: ...... Kousei: Wait, what?! Mei: ...... Kousei: ...... Kousei: ...... Mei: Um... Mei: ...... Mei: During our girls' night out the other day... everyone kept asking me about that time we went to the pool together... Mei: Eventually, the conversation turned to... whether or not I had f-feelings for you, Senpai... Mei: I said I didn't know... but everyone else said it was obvious that I did... Mei: I thought they might be right... but I've never had any sort of romantic experience before... so I wasn't sure. Mei: I can't say I really understand my own feelings... but at the very least, I do know that you're a very important person to me. Mei: That's... what I wanted to tell you today. Mei: But... Mei: ...... Mei: Just now, I realized that... I really do... love you, Senpai. Mei: I mean, love is supposed to make your heart pound, isn't it? But when I'm with you, it's almost the opposite... I feel so relaxed that I thought it couldn't be love. Mei: But right now... my heart is pounding like crazy. Even though all I'm doing is telling you how I feel... my chest feels like it's about to burst. Mei: When I made up my mind to give you these chocolates... and when I decided to ask Suzune-san to teach me how to make them... Mei: While I practiced... This morning... During work... And while I was sitting here waiting for you earlier too... Mei: My heart wouldn't stop pounding. Mei: You wouldn't believe how nervous I felt. Mei: The truth is... I've had feelings for you all this time. Mei: So it's time I worked up the courage to say it. Mei: I... I think I love you, Senpai. Mei: No, wait... That doesn't sound right... Mei: ...... Mei: Senpai... I love you. Mei: I love the way you thank me, even when I've barely done anything... Mei: I love the way you're so nice to me, and lend an ear to all my worries... Mei: And I love so many other things about you too. Mei: So please... Mei: ...... Mei: Please... go out with me. Mei: Please... take me as your girlfriend. Mei: I... want to be with you from now on, Senpai. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Right now... my heart's also hammering like crazy. Kousei: When I thought you were avoiding me... it made me feel so lonely and so worried. Kousei: I was afraid you didn't like me, and I became really depressed. Kousei: Especially when you ran off without giving me any chocolate. Kousei: But then--you messaged to ask if we could meet. My heart wouldn't stop pounding on the way here. Kousei: This whole day's been a roller coaster of emotions for me. Kousei: But if what I'm feeling is the same thing you are... then I'm in love too. Kousei: In love with you, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Ah... Urk... Kousei: I love you too, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: S-So... Kousei: I want you to go out with me. Mei: ...... Mei: Ahhh... Mei: I'm a total mess of emotions right now... Kousei: Me too... My face must be burning up right now. Mei: ...... Kousei: ...... Mei: ...... Kousei: Uh... if you don't mind... Mei: Huh? Kousei: Could I call you by your first name? It'd feel oddly formal... if I kept using your last name. Mei: Y-Yeah, I agree... Go ahead. You don't have to use an honorific either... if you don't want. Kousei: Oh... Mei: Yeah. You can just call me Mei. Kousei: M... M-M-M... Mei: You're stammering so much... Kousei: I-I can't help it. I've never called you this before... Mei: That's fine. I can be patient. Kousei: M-Mei... Mei: There you go. Ehehe... Kousei: What about you? Mei: Huh? Kousei: Will you start calling me by my name? Mei: Senpai? Kousei: That's not what it says on my birth certificate. Mei: Urk... Mei: ...... Mei: Kousei... san? Kousei: You can drop the honorific too. Mei: Well... I mean, I'm younger than you, so... Mei: But maybe I could call you Kou-kun instead-- Mei: No, wait. That's even more embarrassing. Kousei: Yeah... That's pretty embarrassing for me too. Mei: Well, for now... I'm only going to use your first name when we're alone together. Kousei: A-Alright. I guess we wouldn't want the others to tease us about it. Mei: E-Exactly. Kousei: ...... Mei: ...... Kousei: Y-Yeah. I mean, if that's okay with you... Mei: O-Of course it is! Mei: ......

            "Mikado: Is not about the carbonara, no. I shall leave that matter completely up to you. Kousei: Alright. I'll try preparing a few more dishes next week as an experiment. Maybe up the order limit to twenty-five. Kanna: Sounds good. Anyway, I'm sure you can guess why I've asked you two to stay behind. Mei: This is about my eye again, isn't it? Kanna: We just want to know how things are progressing, so this shouldn't take too much of your time. Has anything changed with your eye since we last spoke? Mei: No. I still don't know how to release my butterflies... Kanna: Not to worry. I'm certain you'll get there eventually. Mikado: Our main purpose in opening this cafe has always been to collect butterflies. Thanks to you, that task has been proceeding expeditiously. Mikado: Allow me to thank you for your hard work once again. We owe you our gratitude. Mei: A-All I'm doing is catching butterflies. I'd wouldn't exactly call that \"hard work\"... Mei: B-But either way, I'll continue to do my best to help! Mikado: Thank you. We appreciate it. Mei: ...... Mikado: But while I appreciate your efforts, I will not be transforming into a cat. Mei: Okay. I'm sorry. Kanna: Allow me to thank you as well, Takamine-san. Kousei: Huh? Why me? Kanna: While it was mere coincidence that brought you here to work with us, you've become an invaluable member of our team. Kanna: Many of our customers even come to our cafe specifically to eat your dishes now. Kanna: So thank you very much. You've been an incredible help to us all. Kousei: Well, I mean... this was all because of that \"problem\" I had with my soul in the first place... Kousei: But I'm glad you appreciate me. Honestly, this job has been pretty fulfilling for me too lately. Mikado: Indeed. It would appear your soul's condition has been greatly improving. Kanna: You can't let your guard down just yet, but as long as you keep heading in the right direction, you won't have anything to worry about. Kousei: Phew. That's a relief to hear. I owe it all to Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Huh? Kousei: Thanks for guiding me in the right direction. Mei: N-No, I didn't do anything. Kousei: You did. Thank you for everything. Mei: I-I... Mei: ...... Mei: U-Um, was there anything else you wanted to discuss? Kanna: No, I believe that's it. Mei: In that case, I've got something I need to do, so--! Mikado: Alright. Then we apologize for keeping you. Mei: That's okay! Anyway, I'll be going now! Kousei: Let me walk you-- Mei: Good night! Kousei: Huh? Kousei: Y-Yeah, I am... Kanna: Good night. Kousei: Yeah. Good night... Kousei: ...... Kousei: I should've known... Mei: Y-You're fine. Kousei: Freaking out? Mei: Y-Yeah... I... Um... Mei: ...... Mei: Oh, gosh... I'm so nervous... Mei: U-Umm... I think it would take too long to explain myself, so... h-here! Mei: Yes. It's... my Valentine's Day gift... to you. Kousei: Chocolate! Mei: Y-Yes. It's chocolate, and it's, um... handmade. Kousei: Handmade! Mei: Wow, you're really excited about this... Suzune-san taught me how to make it, so it should taste alright... I think. Kousei: Oh... Is that why you've been going home together lately? Mei: Yeah. I've been going to her apartment so she could teach me. Mei: She's also been helping me by asking you about your preferences and stuff... Kousei: My preferences? Oh, wait. Mei: Ahaha... Sorry. I guess I just felt kind of embarrassed... Kousei: Is that why the others said they weren't giving me any chocolate this year? So this would be a surprise? Mei: What? I don't know anything about that... Mei: But the others knew I was planning on giving you my own chocolate, so... I guess that could be why they did that... Kousei: Phew. I thought for sure you hated me or something... Mei: Wh-What?! Of course not! Why would you think that? Kousei: I mean, you've been avoiding me lately, haven't you? Mei: I-I wasn't... I mean... Well, maybe a little... Kousei: See? Mei: That's only because I didn't want you to find out I was preparing chocolate for you... Mei: But... I'm sorry for acting so weird. I didn't mean to give you the wrong idea. Kousei: It's alright. I've been really anxious these past few days, so it's a relief to know the truth. Mei: Urk... I'm sorry... Kousei: Handmade chocolate, though... This is more than I expected. Thank you. Mei: Um, if you'd like... you're welcome to go ahead and eat it... Kousei: Right now? Mei: Yeah. I actually brought you a fork too. Kousei: To be honest, I was planning to go home and savor it there... Mei: N-No, please! You can't! You can't keep me waiting that long! Mei: My heart's already pounding so fast it's about to explode! Mei: I need to know how you think it tastes right now... or else I'm going to die! Kousei: A-Alright. I'll have a bite... Mei: Please do! There are two inside, so at least try one of them! Right now! Mei: Something like that. It's called a chocolate fondant. Kousei: Sounds fancy. Was it hard to make? Mei: Not at all. Suzune-san was there to guide me through every single step. Mei: Ah, but just for the record--I made this all by myself! And I think I did a pretty good job! Mei: Though, um... it was a lot crispier on the outside when it came out of the oven, but it might be a bit soggy by now. Mei: But it shouldn't taste bad! This was Suzune-san's own personal recipe! I baked it with the utmost care! Mei: The flavor should be to your liking as well! So p-please, go ahead and try some! Kousei: Alright... don't mind if I do then. Mei: H-Help yourself! Kousei: ...... Mei: H-Hello? Kousei: ...... Mei: Senpai? Kousei: ...... Mei: Um... Does it... taste bad? Kousei: It's delicious. Mei: R-Really? Oh, thank goodness! Kousei: Oh god... It's so delicious... Mei: Wait, what? Huh? Kousei: How? How can something taste THIS good?! Mei: O-Oh, come on... You're exaggerating... Kousei: *sniffle*... Mei: Wait, are you crying? You're not pretending, are you? No way. Like, seriously? You're seriously crying? Kousei: I can't help it... Mei: O-Okay? Kousei: Everyone kept saying they wouldn't be giving me any chocolate... Mei: Oh... right. They said it'd be a hassle to get return gifts for everyone. Kousei: Even Nozomi, who usually gives me chocolates every year... gave me nothing. Mei: Wait, every year? Oh, right. You and Nozomi-chan are childhood friends. Kousei: Yeah, but she said she'd only been giving them to me out of force of habit... Mei: Oh... Err... I'm not sure what to say to that. Kousei: In the end, the only person who gave me chocolates was you... And handmade chocolate too... Kousei: Thank you... Thank you, Hiuchidani-san! Mei: I didn't think you'd be THIS emotional... but I'm glad you like it. Mei: But I can't say I was expecting you to start crying... It's a little, um, creepy. Kousei: Yeah, I know. I guess I tried too hard to sell it. Mei: Ah! I KNEW you were pretending, you stinker! Mei: Do you really mean that? Kousei: Yeah. I mean it. Seriously. Kousei: I could finish off both these chocolates right here if I'm not careful. Mei: Phew... Kousei: There's no way you could've gone wrong with Suzune-san's recipe. Mei: Yeah, but still... Kousei: Besides, even if it DID taste bad, I'd never say it to your face. Mei: What? So it really DOES taste bad?! Kousei: No, no. It's delicious. Really. Mei: *sigh*... My heart's pounding so much. Like, I've been feeling so anxious lately. That's why I've been acting so weird... Mei: When I was making the chocolate by hand, I began to understand how you feel, Senpai. Mei: Making food for someone else to eat is incredibly stressful and nerve-wracking... Mei: But it's also really fun, trying to make something that the person will like. Mei: And when you do get that confirmation from them that they like it... Mei: It makes you happier than words can describe! Kousei: I already told you. Why don't you believe me? Mei: Because I'm worried! Kousei: Didn't you taste it yourself beforehand? Mei: Well, yeah. I tried one I made from the same batch, but still... Kousei: It was delicious, wasn't it? Mei: It was, but this one's gone all cold! It's not FRESH! Kousei: Even so, it tastes delicious. Mei: Really? Really, really? Kousei: If you're really that worried about the taste, why don't you try some yourself? Kousei: See? I told you. Mei: Phew... Wait. Ah... Ahh! Kousei: What? Mei: Th-Th-Th-That was... an i-i-indirect k-ki--! Kousei: Oh, right. Sorry. You're pretty sensitive about these sorts of things, aren't you? Mei: O-O-Oh, no! It doesn't bothe--well... i-it does, I guess... Kousei: My bad. I totally forgot. Mei: I-I mean... As long as it's you, I... Mei: ...... Mei: U-U-Umm! Kousei: Hm? Mei: Suzune-san told me something... Kousei: Yeah? Mei: She said that you'd be happy receiving any kind of chocolate for Valentine's Day... Kousei: It's true. I'm pretty thrilled right now. Thank you, seriously. Mei: You're welcome... But she also said that... if I gave you handmade chocolate... Mei: Then... Umm... Kousei: Hm? Mei: Then you'd... umm! Kousei: Yeah? Mei: You'd think that... it meant I had genuine feelings for you... Kousei: O-Oh, come on! I can't believe she told you that too! Mei: Y-Yes... That's what she said... Kousei: I, er, I mean... I was only half-joking when I said that... Mei: You were... joking? Kousei: Y-Yeah. I was just messing with her... Kousei: B-But don't worry! I'm not dumb enough to think you like me just because of a couple chocolates! Mei: ...... Mei: I wouldn't mind... if you thought I did... though. Kousei: O-Okay? Kousei: ...... Kousei: Wait, what?! Mei: ...... Kousei: ...... Kousei: ...... Mei: Um... Mei: ...... Mei: During our girls' night out the other day... everyone kept asking me about that time we went to the pool together... Mei: Eventually, the conversation turned to... whether or not I had f-feelings for you, Senpai... Mei: I said I didn't know... but everyone else said it was obvious that I did... Mei: I thought they might be right... but I've never had any sort of romantic experience before... so I wasn't sure. Mei: I can't say I really understand my own feelings... but at the very least, I do know that you're a very important person to me. Mei: That's... what I wanted to tell you today. Mei: But... Mei: ...... Mei: Just now, I realized that... I really do... love you, Senpai. Mei: I mean, love is supposed to make your heart pound, isn't it? But when I'm with you, it's almost the opposite... I feel so relaxed that I thought it couldn't be love. Mei: But right now... my heart is pounding like crazy. Even though all I'm doing is telling you how I feel... my chest feels like it's about to burst. Mei: When I made up my mind to give you these chocolates... and when I decided to ask Suzune-san to teach me how to make them... Mei: While I practiced... This morning... During work... And while I was sitting here waiting for you earlier too... Mei: My heart wouldn't stop pounding. Mei: You wouldn't believe how nervous I felt. Mei: The truth is... I've had feelings for you all this time. Mei: So it's time I worked up the courage to say it. Mei: I... I think I love you, Senpai. Mei: No, wait... That doesn't sound right... Mei: ...... Mei: Senpai... I love you. Mei: I love the way you thank me, even when I've barely done anything... Mei: I love the way you're so nice to me, and lend an ear to all my worries... Mei: And I love so many other things about you too. Mei: So please... Mei: ...... Mei: Please... go out with me. Mei: Please... take me as your girlfriend. Mei: I... want to be with you from now on, Senpai. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Right now... my heart's also hammering like crazy. Kousei: When I thought you were avoiding me... it made me feel so lonely and so worried. Kousei: I was afraid you didn't like me, and I became really depressed. Kousei: Especially when you ran off without giving me any chocolate. Kousei: But then--you messaged to ask if we could meet. My heart wouldn't stop pounding on the way here. Kousei: This whole day's been a roller coaster of emotions for me. Kousei: But if what I'm feeling is the same thing you are... then I'm in love too. Kousei: In love with you, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Ah... Urk... Kousei: I love you too, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: S-So... Kousei: I want you to go out with me. Mei: ...... Mei: Ahhh... Mei: I'm a total mess of emotions right now... Kousei: Me too... My face must be burning up right now. Mei: ...... Kousei: ...... Mei: ...... Kousei: Uh... if you don't mind... Mei: Huh? Kousei: Could I call you by your first name? It'd feel oddly formal... if I kept using your last name. Mei: Y-Yeah, I agree... Go ahead. You don't have to use an honorific either... if you don't want. Kousei: Oh... Mei: Yeah. You can just call me Mei. Kousei: M... M-M-M... Mei: You're stammering so much... Kousei: I-I can't help it. I've never called you this before... Mei: That's fine. I can be patient. Kousei: M-Mei...

That's even more embarrassing. Kousei: Yeah... That's pretty embarrassing for me too. Mei: Well, for now... I'm only going to use your first name when we're alone together. Kousei: A-Alright. I guess we wouldn't want the others to tease us about it. Mei: E-Exactly. Kousei: ...... Mei: ...... Kousei: Y-Yeah. I mean, if that's okay with you... Mei: O-Of course it is! Mei: ......

Pedestrian A: Mhh, these are great! Kanna: Thank you very much! Once we open for business, we'll be selling a variety of other cakes and baked good as well, so come check us out, if you're interested! Pedestrian A: Hmm... Natsume: W-We hope to see you there! Pedestrian B: Huh? Oh, um, sure! Natsume: If you'd like, please try one of our free samples too! Pedestrian B: A-Alright... Kousei: Oh, hello. You're, er, that employee from Patisserie Sourian, right? Cake Store Worker: Yes. Cake Store Worker: Not at all. I didn't do anything, really. But, umm, I have to ask. Cake Store Worker: How is Shioyama-san doing? Kousei: She's doing just fine. In fact, she's already found a new job. Kousei: She's the one who baked that madeleine you have. Cake Store Worker: What? So she works at this cafe? Kousei: Yep. We're planning to open next week. Cake Store Worker: Really? I had no idea. Kousei: We'll have other freshly-baked sweets and pancakes on opening day, if you're interested. Cake Store Worker: I may just have to stop by then. But anyway, I'd better get going. Kousei: I hope to see you there next week. Cake Store Worker: Of course. Suzune: They should be cool enough now. Suzune: There we go. Phew, looking good. Very good. Here's your strawberry tartlet. What do you think? Suzune: For the last time... It doesn't LOOK delicious; it IS delicious. Mei: Well, I certainly bet it is, but since I haven't tasted it yet, I can't say for sure, can I? Mei: So having said that, let me have a teensy tiny little bite of-- Nozomi: Hands off, missy. You can have some AFTER we take some pictures. Don't forget; this is for our Instogram. Mei: Ahaha! Sorry! Kousei: Alright, let's do this. Nozomi: I guess they don't pay professional photographers for nothing. The pictures they use on restaurant menus usually look way more appetizing. Suzune: This photo, um, actually makes it looks rather UN-appetizing. Or is that just me? Kousei: No, you're definitely right. Not that I can really say anything, since I'm the one who took it. Kousei: I'll try taking a few more and see if we get a lucky shot. Mei: Wait, Senpai! I have a suggestion. Why don't we try switching locations? Kousei: What would that do? Mei: There's a special trick to taking delicious pictures of food, you see. Mei: Ah--not to say the tart doesn't look delicious as it is, of course. It most certainly does. Suzune: Good save. Mei: Phew... So, as I was saying, some girls in my class taught me this super cool trick when taking food pictures! Kousei: Okay. I'm listening. Mei: Allow me to explain! Mei: From what I'm told, you want to take pictures somewhere with a lot of light. Near a windowsill, for example. Kousei: Oh. Mei: Next, you remove any unnecessary objects. Hands, flowers, whatever--get 'em all out of the shot. Mei: The object should be photographed close up, at an angle. Also, it shouldn't necessarily be dead-center in the image, but a little off to the side. Kousei: Interesting. Nozomi: I tried asking around too, and apparently there are a ton of easy-to-use apps that allow you to enhance photos. Mei: Oh, right! My friends also recommended me some photo-editing apps we could use. Nozomi: The girls in your class are pretty knowledgeable about this stuff, huh? Mei: They all love taking selfies. Mei: Both the really girly girls like you, Nozomi-chan, and even girls that act like sleazy old men. And especially the ones addicted to Instogram. Kousei: Well, either way, I'm glad we have you, Hiuchidani-san. Kousei: Without your guidance, we'd be stuck with these crappy pictures I took. Mei: Well, don't thank me just yet... Ka-chik. Mei: How's that look? Suzune: That's amazing. Just look at how shiny the glaze is. Nozomi: Oh my gosh! Nozomi: Kousei-kun's picture actually looks kind of gross when compared to this. Kousei: I'd have to agree. Mei: I can't believe it either. This turned out way better than I thought it would. Mei: I'll send this pic to my friends and ask them what they think. Kousei: Good idea. Let us know what they say. Mei: Aye, aye. Nozomi: How many followers do we have on Instogram right now, by the way? Mei: Barely any. But, I mean, we've only posted a couple basic announcements. Kousei: Still, it's above zero, isn't it? Nozomi: Yeah. As long as we have some, then we know our flyers worked to some extent. Kousei: I wonder if there's anything we can do to get more followers? Mei: There's no special trick, really. You just gotta put in the effort. Mei: Which means posting tons of pretty pictures, and including all the right hashtags so people can find them. Kousei: Ah, okay. Kousei: So you're saying we'll naturally gain more followers if we keep posting more pics of the cakes Suzune-san bakes for us? Suzune: Don't pin this all on me. Our menu also includes pancakes, omelet rice, pasta, coffee, and tea too, in case you've forgotten. Suzune: In my opinion, we should start by photographing all the items on our menu. Mei: Oh, good idea. Let's do that first. Suzune: So make sure you cook up your best for us, okay? Kousei: I'll try. Nozomi: I know it's important to upload pictures of our food, but don't you think it'd feel a little bland if that's ALL we post? Nozomi: Maybe we could post some casual photos every now and then? Or would that be unprofessional? Kousei: I don't think it's a bad idea. Kousei: Posting a variety of pictures might help us gain more followers. As long as we do it in moderation. Mei: Oh! My friends mentioned that too. Apparently, pictures of cats get a lot of impressions. Kousei: Hmm. Mei: Yeah, I suppose we can't just pick some stray cat off the street. Oh--one of my friends responded! Mei: \"Whoa! That looks delish! I'll definitely come order that once you guys open,\" she says! Mission success! Mei: Oh, there's more! \"Try angling it to the side a bit, and zooming in a little closer.\" Nozomi: Seriously? I thought we already had it pretty close. Mei: I guess we wanna eliminate as much of the unnecessary stuff in the background as possible. Hmm. Like this, maybe? Nozomi: Nice! That's gotta be perfect. Mei: Let's do one more. Suzune: Well, I'll leave you girls to it. Once you're done, feel free to eat the tart. Mei: You don't have to tell us twice! Suzune: You're coming with me, Kousei. We're making pancakes to take pictures of next. Kousei: Yes, ma'am! "

Mei: Hehe. I'll be sure to let my grandma know. Have as many as you want! Suzune: Hey, Kousei! Is it ready yet? I'm already getting full from all these kelp rolls! Kousei: Sorry for the wait. I just finished now. Mei: But you added some kind of smoked ingredient, didn't you? Kousei: You'll see. Go ahead and try it. Suzune: Uh-huh. Mei: ...... Suzune: ...... Mei: Oh? Suzune: Something tastes different. It's a lot more fragrant when I bite into it. Mei: It can't be the bacon, right? Where's this smoky flavor coming from? Suzune: It doesn't seem to be the vegetables, either... What exactly did you do? Kousei: It's the black pepper. That's what I smoked. Mei: Ohh! It's the seasoning! Kousei: Yeah. In a way, black pepper is actually the main ingredient in carbonara. That's where the name of the dish comes from, in fact. Suzune: It's derived from the Italian word for charcoal burner, right? Because there's supposed to be so much pepper on it that it turns black. Kousei: Exactly. I was contemplating whether or not to smoke the salt, but I thought that would change the flavor too much. Kousei: So I decided to smoke the pepper instead. This way it adds a nice kick without destroying the balance of the dish. Suzune: You're right. It really does add a nice kick. It's amazing how a small addition can make such a big difference. Suzune: Even though the seasoning is fundamentally the same, the flavor has a lot more depth. Mei: This is amazing! Just like authentic carbonara! Not that I know what authentic carbonara tastes like, but still! Kousei: Glad you like it. I only just finished smoking the pepper, so the smell might be a little harsh-- Kousei: But as long as I let it sit for a while, it should disappear. Then all I need to do is mix it with some regular black pepper to fine tune the flavor. Suzune: Sounds good. It could use a bit of adjusting, but I definitely think this is good enough to serve to our customers. In all honesty, this really is delicious. Kousei: Thanks. What about you-- Mei: Phew! That was good! Kousei: Wow. Not even a crumb left. Mei: It was too good! Just like real Italian cuisine! Not that I know what real Italian cuisine tastes like, but still! Suzune: You already said that earlier. I get what you're trying to say, though. Kousei: Ahaha... I wasn't expecting this much of a reaction. I'm flattered. Mei: Seriously, it was delicious! You're a genius, Senpai! Kousei: O-Oh stop it... Suzune: Well, since Mei-san is showering you in praise, I'm going to be a little more critical. Suzune: Like you said before, the dish still needs some balancing. Kousei: I know. It's got a pretty strong flavor, so I'm gonna try letting it mellow overnight next time. Suzune: Instead of trying to figure out everything on your own, though, you should ask the others at the cafe to taste-test your dish first. Suzune: Then you can decide if you want to tone it down, or if you actually want to emphasize that distinct flavor. Mei: Ohh, I see! The more unique it tastes, the more likely it is to grab people's interest! Suzune: Exactly. But you might get differing opinions on which one is better, which'll make it harder to decide. Suzune: Still, it's up to you. At the very least, I don't think anyone's going to object to you adding this dish to our menu. Kousei: Alright. I'll give it a shot. Kousei: And thanks, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Huh? Kousei: I wouldn't have come up with this idea without you, so thanks. Mei: Please! All I did was suggest the first thing that came to mind. Mei: Don't underestimate your own genius, Senpai! This really is amazing! Kousei: Th-Thanks. Suzune: Ahem. Kousei: Wh-What? Suzune: We're all out of cheese and sausages, so I'm gonna need you to make me some more. Kousei: You already ate them all? I wanted some too, you know. Suzune: Oh, stop griping. C'mon! Kousei: Alright, alright. Fine. Mei: Senpai! I want to try smoking some other things too! Kousei: Sure. I'll rummage around my fridge and see what else we can toss in the smoker. Mei: This is gonna be great! Kanna: Here's to another great year! Let's all do our best! Suzune: Alrighty. Ready to get back to work? Kousei: Yes, ma'am. Kousei: Not so much changed as added a new twist. I tried smoking the pepper first. Natsume: I can't say it looks or smells particularly different, though... Kousei: You'll see once you try it. Nozomi: Well, I'm gonna go ahead and dig in! Nozomi: That faint hint of smokiness... It's amazing how much difference it makes. Natsume: You said you smoked it yourself? Kousei: Yep. It was all Hiuchidani-san's idea. Mei: Don't be silly. You came up with the idea to smoke the black pepper. Mei: All I did was suggest that we try to make our own bacon. Natsume: Ah. So you spent the break thinking up ways to improve our menu... Natsume: That's very commendable of you. I'm impressed. Kousei: Thanks. How do you think it tastes? Kanna: I, for one, think it's delicious. It gives the dish a lot more added depth. Nozomi: I think so too. This seems like it'd be a real crowd-pleaser. Natsume: It certainly is delicious, but... Kousei: But? Natsume: I feel like the pepper's unique smokiness has a sort of... mature taste to it. Natsume: It's definitely not bad by any means, but--and this is just my personal opinion... Natsume: But I think I actually prefer the regular carbonara. Natsume: So while I'm all for adding this to our menu, I don't think it should replace the original version. Nozomi: You said you added the smoked black pepper to the pasta at the end, right? Kousei: Yeah, I did. Nozomi: In that case, why don't we just serve our regular carbonara with a shaker of smoked black pepper on the side? Nozomi: That way, customers can add as much or as little as they want. Natsume: How would we know how much to prepare in advance, though? Some customers might use a lot more than others. Suzune: A lot of beef bowl restaurants used to do the same thing with their special shichimi spices, but they had to stop the practice a little while back. Suzune: Some customers were using unbelievable amounts of spice, which ended up hurting their profits. Nozomi: Oh... I guess that won't work then. Kanna: It seems like our safest option would be to add this smoked pepper version as a separate item on the menu. Kousei: Alright. So I have all the judges' approval? Kanna: Absolutely. I think this would make a fine addition to our menu. Nozomi: Me too. Natsume: Me three. Kanna: What do you think, Mikado-san? Mikado: I believe Natsume mentioned earlier that this dish had a rather mature taste. However, many of our customers also come here specifically for our coffee and tea. Mikado: Judging from what I have gathered, this would suit their preferences well. Mikado: Therefore, I am in agreement. Kousei: Thank goodness... Mei: Way to go, Senpai! Kousei: Thanks! Kousei: I was just gonna do it at home, actually... Mikado: Among other problems, that would be quite expensive. I would not recommend you do that. Kousei: I guess that's true. Mikado: I do have some other ideas you may wish to consider. Are you free to talk after this? Kousei: Sure. I've got time. Kanna: In that case, let's call it a day here. See you tomorrow, everyone. Natsume: See you tomorrow. Nozomi: See you tomorrow! Kousei: Phew... Kousei: Huh? Hiuchidani-san? Mei: Hey. Kousei: What are you still doing here? Mei: I was waiting for you to finish. Kousei: You could've waited inside. Mei: Ahaha. I didn't want to bother you guys. Mei: Anyway, I know I should've said something earlier... but would you mind walking me home? Kousei: Sure. I don't mind. Let's go. Mei: Thanks! Mei: Congratulations on getting your new recipe approved, by the way. Kousei: Well, you helped with that. Mei: Not at all. You did this on your own, Senpai. Kousei: Nah, it's all thanks to you. I would've never come up with this idea on my own. Kousei: Seriously, thank you. I'm really grateful. Kousei: This might sound kind of melodramatic... but I think I've gained a little more confidence in myself now. Mei: Ehehe... You're gonna make me blush. I don't mean to sound melodramatic either, but, like... Mei: You've done a lot for me as well, Senpai. Ever since you've helped me open up about my left eye, I feel like a huge weight's been lifted off my shoulders. Mei: That's why I wanted to be able to return the favor if I could. Mei: I'm glad I managed to be of some small help to you. Kousei: It wasn't small at all. You were a big help. Kousei: I was hoping to do something like this before I had to deal with my exams, so I'm glad it all went so well. Mei: Oh, your exams are coming up? Kousei: At the end of the month, yeah. Mei: Does that mean you're gonna be working fewer hours? Kousei: No, I'll be working the same as usual. I'll do fine as long as I pay attention in class. Kousei: And I can always study after work too. Mei: You're a pretty diligent student, aren't you? Kousei: I don't know about that... I'm just the sort of guy who hates procrastinating. Mei: That's what it means to be diligent, Senpai. I think that's something to be proud of. Kousei: Nah, trust me... I can be pretty lazy when I want. Mei: But in front of me, at least, you're always hardworking and dependable. Kousei: Okay, sheesh. Stop flattering me. It's gonna go to my head. Mei: Ahaha! Alright. Mei: Well, good night, Senpai. Kousei: Good night. And sorry you had to wait for me earlier. Mei: That's okay. I waited because I wanted to congratulate you. Mei: Anyway, see you tomorrow! Kousei: Yeah. See you tomorrow. Mei: ...... Mei: Hmm... Exams... "

Suzune: Something tastes different. It's a lot more fragrant when I bite into it. Mei: It can't be the bacon, right? Where's this smoky flavor coming from? Suzune: It doesn't seem to be the vegetables, either... What exactly did you do? Kousei: It's the black pepper. That's what I smoked. Mei: Ohh! It's the seasoning! Kousei: Yeah. In a way, black pepper is actually the main ingredient in carbonara. That's where the name of the dish comes from, in fact. Suzune: It's derived from the Italian word for charcoal burner, right? Because there's supposed to be so much pepper on it that it turns black. Kousei: Exactly. I was contemplating whether or not to smoke the salt, but I thought that would change the flavor too much. Kousei: So I decided to smoke the pepper instead. This way it adds a nice kick without destroying the balance of the dish. Suzune: You're right. It really does add a nice kick. It's amazing how a small addition can make such a big difference. Suzune: Even though the seasoning is fundamentally the same, the flavor has a lot more depth. Mei: This is amazing! Just like authentic carbonara! Not that I know what authentic carbonara tastes like, but still! Kousei: Glad you like it. I only just finished smoking the pepper, so the smell might be a little harsh-- Kousei: But as long as I let it sit for a while, it should disappear. Then all I need to do is mix it with some regular black pepper to fine tune the flavor. Suzune: Sounds good. It could use a bit of adjusting, but I definitely think this is good enough to serve to our customers. In all honesty, this really is delicious. Kousei: Thanks. What about you-- Mei: Phew! That was good! Kousei: Wow. Not even a crumb left. Mei: It was too good! Just like real Italian cuisine! Not that I know what real Italian cuisine tastes like, but still!

Kanna: It seems like our safest option would be to add this smoked pepper version as a separate item on the menu. Kousei: Alright. So I have all the judges' approval? Kanna: Absolutely. I think this would make a fine addition to our menu. Nozomi: Me too. Natsume: Me three. Kanna: What do you think, Mikado-san? Mikado: I believe Natsume mentioned earlier that this dish had a rather mature taste. However, many of our customers also come here specifically for our coffee and tea. Mikado: Judging from what I have gathered, this would suit their preferences well. Mikado: Therefore, I am in agreement. Kousei: Thank goodness... Mei: Way to go, Senpai! Kousei: Thanks! Kousei: I was just gonna do it at home, actually... Mikado: Among other problems, that would be quite expensive. I would not recommend you do that. Kousei: I guess that's true. Mikado: I do have some other ideas you may wish to consider. Are you free to talk after this? Kousei: Sure. I've got time. Kanna: In that case, let's call it a day here. See you tomorrow, everyone. Natsume: See you tomorrow. Nozomi: See you tomorrow! Kousei: Phew... Kousei: Huh? Hiuchidani-san? Mei: Hey. Kousei: What are you still doing here? Mei: I was waiting for you to finish. Kousei: You could've waited inside. Mei: Ahaha. I didn't want to bother you guys. Mei: Anyway, I know I should've said something earlier... but would you mind walking me home? Kousei: Sure. I don't mind. Let's go. Mei: Thanks! Mei: Congratulations on getting your new recipe approved, by the way. Kousei: Well, you helped with that. Mei: Not at all. You did this on your own, Senpai. Kousei: Nah, it's all thanks to you. I would've never come up with this idea on my own. Kousei: Seriously, thank you. I'm really grateful. Kousei: This might sound kind of melodramatic... but I think I've gained a little more confidence in myself now. Mei: Ehehe... You're gonna make me blush. I don't mean to sound melodramatic either, but, like... Mei: You've done a lot for me as well, Senpai. Ever since you've helped me open up about my left eye, I feel like a huge weight's been lifted off my shoulders. Mei: That's why I wanted to be able to return the favor if I could. Mei: I'm glad I managed to be of some small help to you. Kousei: It wasn't small at all. You were a big help. Kousei: I was hoping to do something like this before I had to deal with my exams, so I'm glad it all went so well. Mei: Oh, your exams are coming up? Kousei: At the end of the month, yeah. Mei: Does that mean you're gonna be working fewer hours? Kousei: No, I'll be working the same as usual. I'll do fine as long as I pay attention in class. Kousei: And I can always study after work too. Mei: You're a pretty diligent student, aren't you? Kousei: I don't know about that... I'm just the sort of guy who hates procrastinating. Mei: That's what it means to be diligent, Senpai. I think that's something to be proud of. Kousei: Nah, trust me... I can be pretty lazy when I want. Mei: But in front of me, at least, you're always hardworking and dependable. Kousei: Okay, sheesh. Stop flattering me. It's gonna go to my head. Mei: Ahaha! Alright. Mei: Well, good night, Senpai. Kousei: Good night. And sorry you had to wait for me earlier. Mei: That's okay. I waited because I wanted to congratulate you. Mei: Anyway, see you tomorrow! Kousei: Yeah. See you tomorrow. Mei: ...... Mei: Hmm... Exams... "

            "Female Student A: So tell us! Where'd you meet this boyfriend of yours? Female Student B: What do you like about him anyway? Not that I'm trying to say he's bad--I'm just curious. Natsume: Kousei and I work at the same cafe. As for what I like about him... Natsume: Well, I enjoy being with him. Despite how he looks, he can also be pretty manly. But I guess I'd say the thing I like most about him is-- Student C: Is? Natsume: Honestly, I'm not sure. Natsume: But I love him a lot. All Three: Ahhh! Female Student B: Ohmigosh, you're SOOO adorable! Student C: You're head over heels for him, aren't you? Female Student A: So does that mean you're the one who asked him out? Natsume: Hmm. It's kind of hard to say. Technically, he's the one who confessed to me. Natsume: But I did kiss him before that. Student C: You kissed before you even started dating? Whoa, girl! Natsume: W-Well, you know. We were watching the sunrise on New Year's, and I got swept up in the moment... Female Student B: Oh, wow. So you two really haven't been going out for long. Student C: So did you guys do the deed outside after that kiss? Natsume: N-No, we didn't! Female Student B: Are you stupid? It's way too cold around this time of year to be having sex outdoors. Female Student A: So you're saying it'd be fine if it were summertime?! Student C: Sorry, Shiki-san! Are we making you uncomfortable? Natsume: No, not particularly... Female Student B: Wait. Are you still a virgin, by any chance? Female Student A: Oh my gosh! Have a little more tact, will you? Natsume: It's fine... Um, I'm not a virgin anymore. All Three: Whoa! Female Student A: You gotta tell us! How was it? Natsume: W-Well, it hurt. Student C: Not surprising. Natsume: But it felt good too. Female Student B: Really? Student C: Your boyfriend--um, Takamine-kun, was it? Has he been with a lot of other girls before you? Natsume: I doubt it. He said it was his first time too. Female Student B: Y'know, when I lost my virginity, I bled like hell. Female Student A: So the blood part is true? Student C: Wait, are you... Female Student A: Urk... Y-Yeah, I'm still a virgin! So what?! Female Student B: Hey, I never said there was anything wrong with that! Better to stay a virgin than to get impatient, throw it away, and end up with a crappy experience. Student C: Yep. You want your first time to be something memorable. Don't you agree, Shiki-san? Natsume: Huh? O-Oh, yeah. It definitely hurt, but it was a really wonderful experience. All Three: Whoa... Natsume: I-I mean, yeah, I agree--you shouldn't just throw away your virginity. Female Student A: A-Alright. I guess I'll just wait for the right guy to come along. Female Student A: Still, I'm kinda scared. Out of curiosity, how bad does it hurt? Female Student B: It's kinda hard to put into words, honestly. It was like an \"Eek!\" if that makes sense. Student C: For me, it was more like... \"Hngh!\" Female Student A: Pretty bad, I take it... Female Student A: What about you, Shiki-san? Natsume: For me, I guess it was only about an \"Ouch!\"... Female Student B: Lucky you. Female Student A: Is there some way to make it hurt less? Natsume: I have no idea. I'm not exactly an expert myself. Student C: Foreplay's probably the most important thing, don't you think? Student C: Then again, some guys have dicks so big it doesn't matter how wet you are. Female Student B: Yeah. Ultimately, it's gonna depend on your partner. Some guys are way too horny and wanna put it in without any foreplay, for example. Female Student A: What should I do if that happens? Student C: Hmm. You could make him cum once, and hopefully that calms him down some. Female Student A: Yeah, but how? Student C: With a handjob or a blowjob. Female Student A: A handjob? Natsume: A blowjob... Student C: You could also go for a thighjob, or an armpitjob--or get creative and go for a hairjob, a footjob, or even a shoulder-blade-job. Female Student B: Sheesh. You've done it all, haven't you? Wait--shoulder blades?! How does that even work?! Student C: What do you mean? You just--wait a minute. Student C: Are you interested in trying out some of this stuff too, Shiki-san? Natsume: Yesn't. Female Student A: What? Was that a yes or a no? Female Student B: Correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like a yes to me! Natsume: Have a good day. Kanna: Good job today, guys. Natsume: Yeah. You too. Suzune: It's been a while now since New Year's, but how are the numbers looking? Kanna: Thankfully, the number of customers hasn't declined in the slightest. Natsume: In fact, we might be getting even more than before, thanks to your Mont Blanc. Suzune: Wow, really? I'm glad all that effort paid off then. Kousei: Must've been a lot of work. Suzune: Well, y'know. It's not easy steaming chestnuts, hollowing them out, then straining them. And you gotta do everything by hand, otherwise the aroma and the texture just won't be the same. Kousei: Should I start coming to work a bit earlier to help out? Suzune: Wow. I thought you hated waking up early. Kousei: I do, but I can deal with it if you need the help. Suzune: Well, I kinda hate to ask you to... Kousei: Why's that? Suzune: You've seem kind of worn out these past few days, if you know what I mean. Kousei: ...... Kousei: I've, uh... been doing a lot of studying. My finals are coming up. Suzune: Well, as someone who lives in the same apartment building, let me give you a bit of advice. You might want to try keeping your voice down while you're \"studying.\" Kousei: ...... Natsume: Don't look at me, idiot. Her room is way too far away from yours; there's no way she'd be able to hear us. Kousei: Ah... Suzune: Hehehe. Well, all jokes aside. Suzune: I appreciate the offer, but I shouldn't be making other employees do extra work. If there's a problem, it's the system that needs to be improved. Kousei: You say that, but you're the one who always ends up doing the brunt of the work, Suzune-san... Suzune: Well, I guess that's just the price I pay for doing things my way. Either way, I shouldn't be pushing the responsibility onto the part-timers. Suzune: You've got exams coming up, don't you? Are you feeling confident about those? I wouldn't want to be responsible for your graduation being pushed back a year. Kousei: Don't worry. Despite what you may think of me, I do take my classes seriously. Natsume: I'm confident enough that I won't need to do any last-minute cramming either. Suzune: Great. Kanna: Still, let us know if you need time off. We'll do our best to handle things here on our own. Natsume: Thanks. I appreciate it. Kousei: So, where to today? Your place, or mine? Natsume: Hmm. Let's go to your place. I want to warm up under your kotatsu. Kousei: Alright. Kousei: I still have some hotpot ingredients leftover from last time too. Natsume: Sounds good. Let's have that. Kousei: Man, they were delicious. Natsume: If I make them, I'll probably end up making a lot, so let's save it for next time, and invite the others over. Kousei: Alright. Kousei: But speaking of which--what ever happened to that qipao you wore during New Year's? Natsume: What is it with you and your cosplay fetish? Kousei: I'm sorry, but you just looked way too cute in it. Kousei: Not to say that you don't normally look cute, because you do. Every day. Natsume: Alright, fine. I'll wear it for you next time, if I'm in the mood. Natsume: Phew. That was good. Kousei: Yep. Natsume: Here, let me clean up. Kousei: Nah, I'll do it today. Natsume: You sure? Well, how about I make us a cup of coffee or tea then? Kousei: Hmm. I could definitely go for a cup of coffee. Kousei: But all I have is the instant stuff. Natsume: Where is it? Kousei: Oh, it's on that shelf up there. The tea's up there too. Only tea bags, though. Natsume: Nope. I'm just waiting for the tea to steep. Kousei: You have to steep tea bags too? Natsume: You don't have to, but the tea's a lot more fragrant this way. Kousei: Huh. Well, I'll be waiting over here. Natsume: Okay. Kousei: Phew. Sure is cold tonight. Kousei: Rokurou-san did seem pretty happy with how things turned out. Natsume: What's that? Kousei: Nothing. Just talking to myself. Natsume: Oh. Well, here's your coffee. Kousei: Sorry I only have tea bags for you. Natsume: I don't really mind. Anyway, scooch over. I need to warm myself up too. Kousei: O-Oh, uh, okay... Kousei: Not much space, though. Natsume: What, do you want me to move? Kousei: I never said that. Kousei: You just don't, err, initiate this sort of... physical intimacy very often. Kousei: It's usually me who does it. Natsume: The only thing you initiate is se... sex, Kousei. Kousei: I won't deny that. But I do like cuddling like this too. Kousei: Especially when you're the one seeking it, Natsume. Natsume: Only because I love you. Natsume: There's nothing I enjoy more than being with my boyfriend. Being able to feel you right next to me is the most blissful thing ever. Kousei: Same for me. Natsume: I can tell. You've had that goofy grin on your face for a while now. "

Maybe up the order limit to twenty-five. Kanna: Sounds good. Anyway, I'm sure you can guess why I've asked you two to stay behind. Mei: This is about my eye again, isn't it? Kanna: We just want to know how things are progressing, so this shouldn't take too much of your time. Has anything changed with your eye since we last spoke? Mei: No. I still don't know how to release my butterflies... Kanna: Not to worry. I'm certain you'll get there eventually. Mikado: Our main purpose in opening this cafe has always been to collect butterflies. Thanks to you, that task has been proceeding expeditiously. Mikado: Allow me to thank you for your hard work once again. We owe you our gratitude. Mei: A-All I'm doing is catching butterflies. I'd wouldn't exactly call that \"hard work\"... Mei: B-But either way, I'll continue to do my best to help! Mikado: Thank you. We appreciate it. Mei: ...... Mikado: But while I appreciate your efforts, I will not be transforming into a cat. Mei: Okay. I'm sorry. Kanna: Allow me to thank you as well, Takamine-san. Kousei: Huh? Why me? Kanna: While it was mere coincidence that brought you here to work with us, you've become an invaluable member of our team. Kanna: Many of our customers even come to our cafe specifically to eat your dishes now. Kanna: So thank you very much. You've been an incredible help to us all. Kousei: Well, I mean... this was all because of that \"problem\" I had with my soul in the first place... Kousei: But I'm glad you appreciate me. Honestly, this job has been pretty fulfilling for me too lately. Mikado: Indeed. It would appear your soul's condition has been greatly improving. Kanna: You can't let your guard down just yet, but as long as you keep heading in the right direction, you won't have anything to worry about. Kousei: Phew. That's a relief to hear. I owe it all to Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Huh? Kousei: Thanks for guiding me in the right direction. Mei: N-No, I didn't do anything. Kousei: You did. Thank you for everything. Mei: I-I... Mei: ...... Mei: U-Um, was there anything else you wanted to discuss? Kanna: No, I believe that's it. Mei: In that case, I've got something I need to do, so--! Mikado: Alright. Then we apologize for keeping you.

Kousei: I should've known... Mei: Y-You're fine. Kousei: Freaking out? Mei: Y-Yeah... I... Um... Mei: ...... Mei: Oh, gosh... I'm so nervous... Mei: U-Umm... I think it would take too long to explain myself, so... h-here! Mei: Yes. It's... my Valentine's Day gift... to you. Kousei: Chocolate! Mei: Y-Yes. It's chocolate, and it's, um... handmade. Kousei: Handmade! Mei: Wow, you're really excited about this... Suzune-san taught me how to make it, so it should taste alright... I think. Kousei: Oh... Is that why you've been going home together lately? Mei: Yeah. I've been going to her apartment so she could teach me. Mei: She's also been helping me by asking you about your preferences and stuff... Kousei: My preferences? Oh, wait. Mei: Ahaha... Sorry. I guess I just felt kind of embarrassed... Kousei: Is that why the others said they weren't giving me any chocolate this year? So this would be a surprise? Mei: What? I don't know anything about that... Mei: But the others knew I was planning on giving you my own chocolate, so... I guess that could be why they did that... Kousei: Phew. I thought for sure you hated me or something... Mei: Wh-What?! Of course not! Why would you think that? Kousei: I mean, you've been avoiding me lately, haven't you? Mei: I-I wasn't... I mean... Well, maybe a little... Kousei: See? Mei: That's only because I didn't want you to find out I was preparing chocolate for you... Mei: But... I'm sorry for acting so weird. I didn't mean to give you the wrong idea. Kousei: It's alright. I've been really anxious these past few days, so it's a relief to know the truth. Mei: Urk... I'm sorry... Kousei: Handmade chocolate, though... This is more than I expected. Thank you. Mei: Um, if you'd like... you're welcome to go ahead and eat it... Kousei: Right now? Mei: Yeah. I actually brought you a fork too. Kousei: To be honest, I was planning to go home and savor it there... Mei: N-No, please! You can't! You can't keep me waiting that long! Mei: My heart's already pounding so fast it's about to explode! Mei: I need to know how you think it tastes right now... or else I'm going to die! Kousei: A-Alright. I'll have a bite... Mei: Please do! There are two inside, so at least try one of them! Right now! Mei: Something like that. It's called a chocolate fondant. Kousei: Sounds fancy. Was it hard to make? Mei: Not at all. Suzune-san was there to guide me through every single step. Mei: Ah, but just for the record--I made this all by myself! And I think I did a pretty good job! Mei: Though, um... it was a lot crispier on the outside when it came out of the oven, but it might be a bit soggy by now. Mei: But it shouldn't taste bad! This was Suzune-san's own personal recipe! I baked it with the utmost care! Mei: The flavor should be to your liking as well! So p-please, go ahead and try some! Kousei: Alright... don't mind if I do then. Mei: H-Help yourself! Kousei: ...... Mei: H-Hello? Kousei: ...... Mei: Senpai? Kousei: ...... Mei: Um... Does it... taste bad? Kousei: It's delicious. Mei: R-Really? Oh, thank goodness! Kousei: Oh god... It's so delicious... Mei: Wait, what? Huh? Kousei: How? How can something taste THIS good?! Mei: O-Oh, come on... You're exaggerating... Kousei: *sniffle*... Mei: Wait, are you crying? You're not pretending, are you? No way. Like, seriously? You're seriously crying? Kousei: I can't help it... Mei: O-Okay? Kousei: Everyone kept saying they wouldn't be giving me any chocolate... Mei: Oh... right. They said it'd be a hassle to get return gifts for everyone. Kousei: Even Nozomi, who usually gives me chocolates every year... gave me nothing. Mei: Wait, every year? Oh, right. You and Nozomi-chan are childhood friends. Kousei: Yeah, but she said she'd only been giving them to me out of force of habit... Mei: Oh... Err... I'm not sure what to say to that. Kousei: In the end, the only person who gave me chocolates was you... And handmade chocolate too... Kousei: Thank you... Thank you, Hiuchidani-san! Mei: I didn't think you'd be THIS emotional... but I'm glad you like it. Mei: But I can't say I was expecting you to start crying... It's a little, um, creepy. Kousei: Yeah, I know. I guess I tried too hard to sell it. Mei: Ah! I KNEW you were pretending, you stinker! Mei: Do you really mean that? Kousei: Yeah. I mean it. Seriously. Kousei: I could finish off both these chocolates right here if I'm not careful. Mei: Phew... Kousei: There's no way you could've gone wrong with Suzune-san's recipe. Mei: Yeah, but still... Kousei: Besides, even if it DID taste bad, I'd never say it to your face. Mei: What? So it really DOES taste bad?! Kousei: No, no. It's delicious. Really. Mei: *sigh*... My heart's pounding so much. Like, I've been feeling so anxious lately. That's why I've been acting so weird... Mei: When I was making the chocolate by hand, I began to understand how you feel, Senpai. Mei: Making food for someone else to eat is incredibly stressful and nerve-wracking... Mei: But it's also really fun, trying to make something that the person will like. Mei: And when you do get that confirmation from them that they like it... Mei: It makes you happier than words can describe! Kousei: I already told you. Why don't you believe me? Mei: Because I'm worried! Kousei: Didn't you taste it yourself beforehand? Mei: Well, yeah. I tried one I made from the same batch, but still... Kousei: It was delicious, wasn't it? Mei: It was, but this one's gone all cold! It's not FRESH! Kousei: Even so, it tastes delicious. Mei: Really? Really, really? Kousei: If you're really that worried about the taste, why don't you try some yourself? Kousei: See? I told you. Mei: Phew... Wait. Ah... Ahh! Kousei: What? Mei: Th-Th-Th-That was... an i-i-indirect k-ki--! Kousei: Oh, right. Sorry. You're pretty sensitive about these sorts of things, aren't you? Mei: O-O-Oh, no! It doesn't bothe--well... i-it does, I guess... Kousei: My bad. I totally forgot. Mei: I-I mean... As long as it's you, I... Mei: ...... Mei: U-U-Umm! Kousei: Hm? Mei: Suzune-san told me something... Kousei: Yeah? Mei: She said that you'd be happy receiving any kind of chocolate for Valentine's Day... Kousei: It's true. I'm pretty thrilled right now. Thank you, seriously. Mei: You're welcome... But she also said that... if I gave you handmade chocolate... Mei: Then... Umm... Kousei: Hm? Mei: Then you'd... umm! Kousei: Yeah? Mei: You'd think that... it meant I had genuine feelings for you... Kousei: O-Oh, come on! I can't believe she told you that too! Mei: Y-Yes... That's what she said... Kousei: I, er, I mean... I was only half-joking when I said that... Mei: You were... joking? Kousei: Y-Yeah. I was just messing with her... Kousei: B-But don't worry! I'm not dumb enough to think you like me just because of a couple chocolates! Mei: ...... Mei: I wouldn't mind... if you thought I did... though. Kousei: O-Okay? Kousei: ...... Kousei: Wait, what?! Mei: ...... Kousei: ...... Kousei: ...... Mei: Um... Mei: ...... Mei: During our girls' night out the other day... everyone kept asking me about that time we went to the pool together... Mei: Eventually, the conversation turned to... whether or not I had f-feelings for you, Senpai... Mei: I said I didn't know... but everyone else said it was obvious that I did... Mei: I thought they might be right... but I've never had any sort of romantic experience before... so I wasn't sure. Mei: I can't say I really understand my own feelings... but at the very least, I do know that you're a very important person to me. Mei: That's... what I wanted to tell you today. Mei: But... Mei: ...... Mei: Just now, I realized that... I really do... love you, Senpai. Mei: I mean, love is supposed to make your heart pound, isn't it? But when I'm with you, it's almost the opposite... I feel so relaxed that I thought it couldn't be love. Mei: But right now... my heart is pounding like crazy. Even though all I'm doing is telling you how I feel... my chest feels like it's about to burst. Mei: When I made up my mind to give you these chocolates... and when I decided to ask Suzune-san to teach me how to make them... Mei: While I practiced... This morning... During work... And while I was sitting here waiting for you earlier too... Mei: My heart wouldn't stop pounding. Mei: You wouldn't believe how nervous I felt. Mei: The truth is... I've had feelings for you all this time. Mei: So it's time I worked up the courage to say it. Mei: I... I think I love you, Senpai. Mei: No, wait... That doesn't sound right... Mei: ...... Mei: Senpai... I love you. Mei: I love the way you thank me, even when I've barely done anything... Mei: I love the way you're so nice to me, and lend an ear to all my worries... Mei: And I love so many other things about you too. Mei: So please... Mei: ...... Mei: Please... go out with me. Mei: Please... take me as your girlfriend. Mei: I... want to be with you from now on, Senpai. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Right now... my heart's also hammering like crazy. Kousei: When I thought you were avoiding me... it made me feel so lonely and so worried. Kousei: I was afraid you didn't like me, and I became really depressed. Kousei: Especially when you ran off without giving me any chocolate. Kousei: But then--you messaged to ask if we could meet. My heart wouldn't stop pounding on the way here. Kousei: This whole day's been a roller coaster of emotions for me. Kousei: But if what I'm feeling is the same thing you are... then I'm in love too. Kousei: In love with you, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Ah... Urk... Kousei: I love you too, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: S-So... Kousei: I want you to go out with me. Mei: ...... Mei: Ahhh... Mei: I'm a total mess of emotions right now... Kousei: Me too... My face must be burning up right now. Mei: ...... Kousei: ...... Mei: ...... Kousei: Uh... if you don't mind... Mei: Huh? Kousei: Could I call you by your first name? It'd feel oddly formal... if I kept using your last name. Mei: Y-Yeah, I agree... Go ahead. You don't have to use an honorific either... if you don't want. Kousei: Oh... Mei: Yeah. You can just call me Mei. Kousei: M... M-M-M... Mei: You're stammering so much... Kousei: I-I can't help it. I've never called you this before... Mei: That's fine. I can be patient. Kousei: M-Mei... Mei: There you go. Ehehe... Kousei: What about you? Mei: Huh? Kousei: Will you start calling me by my name? Mei: Senpai? Kousei: That's not what it says on my birth certificate. Mei: Urk... Mei: ...... Mei: Kousei... san? Kousei: You can drop the honorific too. Mei: Well... I mean, I'm younger than you, so... Mei: But maybe I could call you Kou-kun instead-- Mei: No, wait. That's even more embarrassing. Kousei: Yeah... That's pretty embarrassing for me too. Mei: Well, for now... I'm only going to use your first name when we're alone together. Kousei: A-Alright. I guess we wouldn't want the others to tease us about it. Mei: E-Exactly. Kousei: ...... Mei: ...... Kousei: Y-Yeah. I mean, if that's okay with you... Mei: O-Of course it is! Mei: ...... Mei: Finally... I'm your girlfriend! "

Maybe up the order limit to twenty-five. Kanna: Sounds good. Anyway, I'm sure you can guess why I've asked you two to stay behind. Mei: This is about my eye again, isn't it? Kanna: We just want to know how things are progressing, so this shouldn't take too much of your time. Has anything changed with your eye since we last spoke? Mei: No. I still don't know how to release my butterflies... Kanna: Not to worry. I'm certain you'll get there eventually. Mikado: Our main purpose in opening this cafe has always been to collect butterflies. Thanks to you, that task has been proceeding expeditiously. Mikado: Allow me to thank you for your hard work once again. We owe you our gratitude. Mei: A-All I'm doing is catching butterflies. I'd wouldn't exactly call that \"hard work\"... Mei: B-But either way, I'll continue to do my best to help! Mikado: Thank you. We appreciate it. Mei: ...... Mikado: But while I appreciate your efforts, I will not be transforming into a cat. Mei: Okay. I'm sorry. Kanna: Allow me to thank you as well, Takamine-san. Kousei: Huh? Why me? Kanna: While it was mere coincidence that brought you here to work with us, you've become an invaluable member of our team. Kanna: Many of our customers even come to our cafe specifically to eat your dishes now. Kanna: So thank you very much. You've been an incredible help to us all. Kousei: Well, I mean... this was all because of that \"problem\" I had with my soul in the first place... Kousei: But I'm glad you appreciate me. Honestly, this job has been pretty fulfilling for me too lately. Mikado: Indeed. It would appear your soul's condition has been greatly improving. Kanna: You can't let your guard down just yet, but as long as you keep heading in the right direction, you won't have anything to worry about. Kousei: Phew. That's a relief to hear. I owe it all to Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Huh? Kousei: Thanks for guiding me in the right direction. Mei: N-No, I didn't do anything. Kousei: You did. Thank you for everything. Mei: I-I... Mei: ...... Mei: U-Um, was there anything else you wanted to discuss? Kanna: No, I believe that's it. Mei: In that case, I've got something I need to do, so--! Mikado: Alright. Then we apologize for keeping you. Mei: That's okay! Anyway, I'll be going now! Kousei: Let me walk you-- Mei: Good night! Kousei: Huh? Kousei: Y-Yeah, I am... Kanna: Good night. Kousei: Yeah. Good night... Kousei: ...... Kousei: I should've known... Mei: Y-You're fine. Kousei: Freaking out? Mei: Y-Yeah... I... Um... Mei: ...... Mei: Oh, gosh... I'm so nervous... Mei: U-Umm... I think it would take too long to explain myself, so... h-here! Mei: Yes. It's... my Valentine's Day gift... to you. Kousei: Chocolate! Mei: Y-Yes. It's chocolate, and it's, um... handmade. Kousei: Handmade! Mei: Wow, you're really excited about this... Suzune-san taught me how to make it, so it should taste alright... I think. Kousei: Oh... Is that why you've been going home together lately? Mei: Yeah. I've been going to her apartment so she could teach me. Mei: She's also been helping me by asking you about your preferences and stuff... Kousei: My preferences? Oh, wait. Mei: Ahaha... Sorry. I guess I just felt kind of embarrassed... Kousei: Is that why the others said they weren't giving me any chocolate this year? So this would be a surprise? Mei: What? I don't know anything about that... Mei: But the others knew I was planning on giving you my own chocolate, so... I guess that could be why they did that... Kousei: Phew. I thought for sure you hated me or something... Mei: Wh-What?! Of course not! Why would you think that? Kousei: I mean, you've been avoiding me lately, haven't you? Mei: I-I wasn't... I mean... Well, maybe a little... Kousei: See? Mei: That's only because I didn't want you to find out I was preparing chocolate for you... Mei: But... I'm sorry for acting so weird. I didn't mean to give you the wrong idea. Kousei: It's alright. I've been really anxious these past few days, so it's a relief to know the truth. Mei: Urk... I'm sorry... Kousei: Handmade chocolate, though... This is more than I expected. Thank you. Mei: Um, if you'd like... you're welcome to go ahead and eat it... Kousei: Right now? Mei: Yeah. I actually brought you a fork too. Kousei: To be honest, I was planning to go home and savor it there... Mei: N-No, please! You can't! You can't keep me waiting that long! Mei: My heart's already pounding so fast it's about to explode! Mei: I need to know how you think it tastes right now... or else I'm going to die! Kousei: A-Alright. I'll have a bite... Mei: Please do! There are two inside, so at least try one of them! Right now! Mei: Something like that. It's called a chocolate fondant. Kousei: Sounds fancy. Was it hard to make? Mei: Not at all. Suzune-san was there to guide me through every single step. Mei: Ah, but just for the record--I made this all by myself! And I think I did a pretty good job! Mei: Though, um... it was a lot crispier on the outside when it came out of the oven, but it might be a bit soggy by now. Mei: But it shouldn't taste bad! This was Suzune-san's own personal recipe! I baked it with the utmost care! Mei: The flavor should be to your liking as well! So p-please, go ahead and try some! Kousei: Alright... don't mind if I do then. Mei: H-Help yourself! Kousei: ...... Mei: H-Hello? Kousei: ...... Mei: Senpai? Kousei: ...... Mei: Um... Does it... taste bad? Kousei: It's delicious. Mei: R-Really? Oh, thank goodness! Kousei: Oh god... It's so delicious... Mei: Wait, what? Huh? Kousei: How? How can something taste THIS good?! Mei: O-Oh, come on... You're exaggerating... Kousei: *sniffle*... Mei: Wait, are you crying? You're not pretending, are you? No way. Like, seriously? You're seriously crying? Kousei: I can't help it... Mei: O-Okay? Kousei: Everyone kept saying they wouldn't be giving me any chocolate... Mei: Oh... right. They said it'd be a hassle to get return gifts for everyone. Kousei: Even Nozomi, who usually gives me chocolates every year... gave me nothing. Mei: Wait, every year? Oh, right. You and Nozomi-chan are childhood friends. Kousei: Yeah, but she said she'd only been giving them to me out of force of habit... Mei: Oh... Err... I'm not sure what to say to that. Kousei: In the end, the only person who gave me chocolates was you... And handmade chocolate too... Kousei: Thank you... Thank you, Hiuchidani-san! Mei: I didn't think you'd be THIS emotional... but I'm glad you like it. Mei: But I can't say I was expecting you to start crying... It's a little, um, creepy. Kousei: Yeah, I know. I guess I tried too hard to sell it. Mei: Ah! I KNEW you were pretending, you stinker! Mei: Do you really mean that? Kousei: Yeah. I mean it. Seriously. Kousei: I could finish off both these chocolates right here if I'm not careful. Mei: Phew... Kousei: There's no way you could've gone wrong with Suzune-san's recipe. Mei: Yeah, but still... Kousei: Besides, even if it DID taste bad, I'd never say it to your face. Mei: What? So it really DOES taste bad?! Kousei: No, no. It's delicious. Really. Mei: *sigh*... My heart's pounding so much. Like, I've been feeling so anxious lately. That's why I've been acting so weird... Mei: When I was making the chocolate by hand, I began to understand how you feel, Senpai. Mei: Making food for someone else to eat is incredibly stressful and nerve-wracking... Mei: But it's also really fun, trying to make something that the person will like. Mei: And when you do get that confirmation from them that they like it... Mei: It makes you happier than words can describe! Kousei: I already told you. Why don't you believe me? Mei: Because I'm worried! Kousei: Didn't you taste it yourself beforehand? Mei: Well, yeah. I tried one I made from the same batch, but still... Kousei: It was delicious, wasn't it? Mei: It was, but this one's gone all cold! It's not FRESH! Kousei: Even so, it tastes delicious. Mei: Really? Really, really? Kousei: If you're really that worried about the taste, why don't you try some yourself? Kousei: See? I told you. Mei: Phew... Wait. Ah... Ahh! Kousei: What? Mei: Th-Th-Th-That was... an i-i-indirect k-ki--! Kousei: Oh, right. Sorry. You're pretty sensitive about these sorts of things, aren't you? Mei: O-O-Oh, no! It doesn't bothe--well... i-it does, I guess... Kousei: My bad. I totally forgot. Mei: I-I mean... As long as it's you, I... Mei: ...... Mei: U-U-Umm! Kousei: Hm? Mei: Suzune-san told me something... Kousei: Yeah? Mei: She said that you'd be happy receiving any kind of chocolate for Valentine's Day... Kousei: It's true. I'm pretty thrilled right now. Thank you, seriously. Mei: You're welcome... But she also said that... if I gave you handmade chocolate... Mei: Then... Umm... Kousei: Hm? Mei: Then you'd... umm! Kousei: Yeah? Mei: You'd think that... it meant I had genuine feelings for you... Kousei: O-Oh, come on! I can't believe she told you that too! Mei: Y-Yes... That's what she said... Kousei: I, er, I mean... I was only half-joking when I said that... Mei: You were... joking? Kousei: Y-Yeah. I was just messing with her... Kousei: B-But don't worry! I'm not dumb enough to think you like me just because of a couple chocolates! Mei: ...... Mei: I wouldn't mind... if you thought I did... though. Kousei: O-Okay? Kousei: ...... Kousei: Wait, what?! Mei: ...... Kousei: ...... Kousei: ...... Mei: Um... Mei: ...... Mei: During our girls' night out the other day... everyone kept asking me about that time we went to the pool together... Mei: Eventually, the conversation turned to... whether or not I had f-feelings for you, Senpai... Mei: I said I didn't know... but everyone else said it was obvious that I did... Mei: I thought they might be right... but I've never had any sort of romantic experience before... so I wasn't sure. Mei: I can't say I really understand my own feelings... but at the very least, I do know that you're a very important person to me. Mei: That's... what I wanted to tell you today. Mei: But... Mei: ...... Mei: Just now, I realized that... I really do... love you, Senpai. Mei: I mean, love is supposed to make your heart pound, isn't it? But when I'm with you, it's almost the opposite... I feel so relaxed that I thought it couldn't be love. Mei: But right now... my heart is pounding like crazy. Even though all I'm doing is telling you how I feel... my chest feels like it's about to burst. Mei: When I made up my mind to give you these chocolates... and when I decided to ask Suzune-san to teach me how to make them... Mei: While I practiced... This morning... During work... And while I was sitting here waiting for you earlier too... Mei: My heart wouldn't stop pounding. Mei: You wouldn't believe how nervous I felt. Mei: The truth is... I've had feelings for you all this time. Mei: So it's time I worked up the courage to say it. Mei: I... I think I love you, Senpai. Mei: No, wait... That doesn't sound right... Mei: ...... Mei: Senpai... I love you. Mei: I love the way you thank me, even when I've barely done anything... Mei: I love the way you're so nice to me, and lend an ear to all my worries... Mei: And I love so many other things about you too. Mei: So please... Mei: ...... Mei: Please... go out with me. Mei: Please... take me as your girlfriend. Mei: I... want to be with you from now on, Senpai. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Right now... my heart's also hammering like crazy. Kousei: When I thought you were avoiding me... it made me feel so lonely and so worried. Kousei: I was afraid you didn't like me, and I became really depressed. Kousei: Especially when you ran off without giving me any chocolate. Kousei: But then--you messaged to ask if we could meet. My heart wouldn't stop pounding on the way here. Kousei: This whole day's been a roller coaster of emotions for me. Kousei: But if what I'm feeling is the same thing you are... then I'm in love too. Kousei: In love with you, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Ah... Urk... Kousei: I love you too, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: S-So... Kousei: I want you to go out with me. Mei: ...... Mei: Ahhh... Mei: I'm a total mess of emotions right now... Kousei: Me too...

Mei: I can't say I really understand my own feelings... but at the very least, I do know that you're a very important person to me. Mei: That's... what I wanted to tell you today. Mei: But... Mei: ...... Mei: Just now, I realized that... I really do... love you, Senpai. Mei: I mean, love is supposed to make your heart pound, isn't it? But when I'm with you, it's almost the opposite... I feel so relaxed that I thought it couldn't be love. Mei: But right now... my heart is pounding like crazy. Even though all I'm doing is telling you how I feel... my chest feels like it's about to burst. Mei: When I made up my mind to give you these chocolates... and when I decided to ask Suzune-san to teach me how to make them... Mei: While I practiced... This morning... During work... And while I was sitting here waiting for you earlier too... Mei: My heart wouldn't stop pounding. Mei: You wouldn't believe how nervous I felt. Mei: The truth is... I've had feelings for you all this time. Mei: So it's time I worked up the courage to say it. Mei: I... I think I love you, Senpai. Mei: No, wait... That doesn't sound right... Mei: ...... Mei: Senpai... I love you. Mei: I love the way you thank me, even when I've barely done anything... Mei: I love the way you're so nice to me, and lend an ear to all my worries... Mei: And I love so many other things about you too. Mei: So please... Mei: ...... Mei: Please... go out with me. Mei: Please... take me as your girlfriend. Mei: I... want to be with you from now on, Senpai. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Right now... my heart's also hammering like crazy. Kousei: When I thought you were avoiding me... it made me feel so lonely and so worried. Kousei: I was afraid you didn't like me, and I became really depressed. Kousei: Especially when you ran off without giving me any chocolate. Kousei: But then--you messaged to ask if we could meet. My heart wouldn't stop pounding on the way here. Kousei: This whole day's been a roller coaster of emotions for me. Kousei: But if what I'm feeling is the same thing you are... then I'm in love too. Kousei: In love with you, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Ah... Urk... Kousei: I love you too, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: S-So... Kousei: I want you to go out with me. Mei: ...... Mei: Ahhh... Mei: I'm a total mess of emotions right now... Kousei: Me too... My face must be burning up right now. Mei: ...... Kousei: ...... Mei: ...... Kousei: Uh... if you don't mind... Mei: Huh? Kousei: Could I call you by your first name? It'd feel oddly formal... if I kept using your last name. Mei: Y-Yeah, I agree... Go ahead. You don't have to use an honorific either... if you don't want. Kousei: Oh... Mei: Yeah. You can just call me Mei. Kousei: M... M-M-M... Mei: You're stammering so much... Kousei: I-I can't help it. I've never called you this before... Mei: That's fine. I can be patient. Kousei: M-Mei... Mei: There you go. Ehehe... Kousei: What about you? Mei: Huh? Kousei: Will you start calling me by my name? Mei: Senpai? Kousei: That's not what it says on my birth certificate. Mei: Urk... Mei: ...... Mei: Kousei... san? Kousei: You can drop the honorific too. Mei: Well... I mean, I'm younger than you, so... Mei: But maybe I could call you Kou-kun instead-- Mei: No, wait. That's even more embarrassing. Kousei: Yeah... That's pretty embarrassing for me too. Mei: Well, for now... I'm only going to use your first name when we're alone together. Kousei: A-Alright. I guess we wouldn't want the others to tease us about it. Mei: E-Exactly. Kousei: ...... Mei: ...... Kousei: Y-Yeah. I mean, if that's okay with you... Mei: O-Of course it is! Mei: ...... Mei: Finally... I'm your girlfriend! \n\nWhile these examples may provide some guidance, evaluate their relevance to the current conversation.

Pedestrian A: Mhh, these are great! Kanna: Thank you very much! Once we open for business, we'll be selling a variety of other cakes and baked good as well, so come check us out, if you're interested! Pedestrian A: Hmm... Natsume: W-We hope to see you there! Pedestrian B: Huh? Oh, um, sure! Natsume: If you'd like, please try one of our free samples too! Pedestrian B: A-Alright... Kousei: Oh, hello. You're, er, that employee from Patisserie Sourian, right? Cake Store Worker: Yes. Cake Store Worker: Not at all. I didn't do anything, really. But, umm, I have to ask. Cake Store Worker: How is Shioyama-san doing? Kousei: She's doing just fine. In fact, she's already found a new job. Kousei: She's the one who baked that madeleine you have. Cake Store Worker: What? So she works at this cafe? Kousei: Yep. We're planning to open next week. Cake Store Worker: Really? I had no idea. Kousei: We'll have other freshly-baked sweets and pancakes on opening day, if you're interested. Cake Store Worker: I may just have to stop by then. But anyway, I'd better get going. Kousei: I hope to see you there next week. Cake Store Worker: Of course. Suzune: They should be cool enough now. Suzune: There we go. Phew, looking good. Very good. Here's your strawberry tartlet. What do you think? Suzune: For the last time... It doesn't LOOK delicious; it IS delicious. Mei: Well, I certainly bet it is, but since I haven't tasted it yet, I can't say for sure, can I? Mei: So having said that, let me have a teensy tiny little bite of-- Nozomi: Hands off, missy. You can have some AFTER we take some pictures. Don't forget; this is for our Instogram. Mei: Ahaha! Sorry! Kousei: Alright, let's do this. Nozomi: I guess they don't pay professional photographers for nothing. The pictures they use on restaurant menus usually look way more appetizing. Suzune: This photo, um, actually makes it looks rather UN-appetizing. Or is that just me? Kousei: No, you're definitely right. Not that I can really say anything, since I'm the one who took it. Kousei: I'll try taking a few more and see if we get a lucky shot. Mei: Wait, Senpai! I have a suggestion. Why don't we try switching locations? Kousei: What would that do? Mei: There's a special trick to taking delicious pictures of food, you see. Mei: Ah--not to say the tart doesn't look delicious as it is, of course. It most certainly does. Suzune: Good save. Mei: Phew... So, as I was saying, some girls in my class taught me this super cool trick when taking food pictures! Kousei: Okay. I'm listening. Mei: Allow me to explain! Mei: From what I'm told, you want to take pictures somewhere with a lot of light. Near a windowsill, for example. Kousei: Oh. Mei: Next, you remove any unnecessary objects. Hands, flowers, whatever--get 'em all out of the shot. Mei: The object should be photographed close up, at an angle. Also, it shouldn't necessarily be dead-center in the image, but a little off to the side. Kousei: Interesting. Nozomi: I tried asking around too, and apparently there are a ton of easy-to-use apps that allow you to enhance photos. Mei: Oh, right! My friends also recommended me some photo-editing apps we could use. Nozomi: The girls in your class are pretty knowledgeable about this stuff, huh? Mei: They all love taking selfies. Mei: Both the really girly girls like you, Nozomi-chan, and even girls that act like sleazy old men. And especially the ones addicted to Instogram. Kousei: Well, either way, I'm glad we have you, Hiuchidani-san. Kousei: Without your guidance, we'd be stuck with these crappy pictures I took. Mei: Well, don't thank me just yet... Ka-chik. Mei: How's that look? Suzune: That's amazing. Just look at how shiny the glaze is. Nozomi: Oh my gosh! Nozomi: Kousei-kun's picture actually looks kind of gross when compared to this. Kousei: I'd have to agree. Mei: I can't believe it either. This turned out way better than I thought it would. Mei: I'll send this pic to my friends and ask them what they think. Kousei: Good idea. Let us know what they say. Mei: Aye, aye. Nozomi: How many followers do we have on Instogram right now, by the way? Mei: Barely any. But, I mean, we've only posted a couple basic announcements. Kousei: Still, it's above zero, isn't it? Nozomi: Yeah. As long as we have some, then we know our flyers worked to some extent. Kousei: I wonder if there's anything we can do to get more followers? Mei: There's no special trick, really. You just gotta put in the effort. Mei: Which means posting tons of pretty pictures, and including all the right hashtags so people can find them. Kousei: Ah, okay. Kousei: So you're saying we'll naturally gain more followers if we keep posting more pics of the cakes Suzune-san bakes for us? Suzune: Don't pin this all on me. Our menu also includes pancakes, omelet rice, pasta, coffee, and tea too, in case you've forgotten. Suzune: In my opinion, we should start by photographing all the items on our menu. Mei: Oh, good idea. Let's do that first. Suzune: So make sure you cook up your best for us, okay? Kousei: I'll try. Nozomi: I know it's important to upload pictures of our food, but don't you think it'd feel a little bland if that's ALL we post? Nozomi: Maybe we could post some casual photos every now and then? Or would that be unprofessional? Kousei: I don't think it's a bad idea. Kousei: Posting a variety of pictures might help us gain more followers. As long as we do it in moderation. Mei: Oh! My friends mentioned that too. Apparently, pictures of cats get a lot of impressions. Kousei: Hmm. Mei: Yeah, I suppose we can't just pick some stray cat off the street. Oh--one of my friends responded! Mei: \"Whoa! That looks delish! I'll definitely come order that once you guys open,\" she says! Mission success! Mei: Oh, there's more! \"Try angling it to the side a bit, and zooming in a little closer.\" Nozomi: Seriously? I thought we already had it pretty close. Mei: I guess we wanna eliminate as much of the unnecessary stuff in the background as possible. Hmm. Like this, maybe? Nozomi: Nice! That's gotta be perfect. Mei: Let's do one more. Suzune: Well, I'll leave you girls to it. Once you're done, feel free to eat the tart. Mei: You don't have to tell us twice! Suzune: You're coming with me, Kousei. We're making pancakes to take pictures of next. Kousei: Yes, ma'am! "

Mei: Hehe. I'll be sure to let my grandma know. Have as many as you want! Suzune: Hey, Kousei! Is it ready yet? I'm already getting full from all these kelp rolls! Kousei: Sorry for the wait. I just finished now. Mei: But you added some kind of smoked ingredient, didn't you? Kousei: You'll see. Go ahead and try it. Suzune: Uh-huh. Mei: ...... Suzune: ...... Mei: Oh? Suzune: Something tastes different. It's a lot more fragrant when I bite into it. Mei: It can't be the bacon, right? Where's this smoky flavor coming from? Suzune: It doesn't seem to be the vegetables, either... What exactly did you do? Kousei: It's the black pepper. That's what I smoked. Mei: Ohh! It's the seasoning! Kousei: Yeah. In a way, black pepper is actually the main ingredient in carbonara. That's where the name of the dish comes from, in fact. Suzune: It's derived from the Italian word for charcoal burner, right? Because there's supposed to be so much pepper on it that it turns black. Kousei: Exactly. I was contemplating whether or not to smoke the salt, but I thought that would change the flavor too much. Kousei: So I decided to smoke the pepper instead. This way it adds a nice kick without destroying the balance of the dish. Suzune: You're right. It really does add a nice kick. It's amazing how a small addition can make such a big difference. Suzune: Even though the seasoning is fundamentally the same, the flavor has a lot more depth. Mei: This is amazing! Just like authentic carbonara! Not that I know what authentic carbonara tastes like, but still! Kousei: Glad you like it. I only just finished smoking the pepper, so the smell might be a little harsh-- Kousei: But as long as I let it sit for a while, it should disappear. Then all I need to do is mix it with some regular black pepper to fine tune the flavor. Suzune: Sounds good. It could use a bit of adjusting, but I definitely think this is good enough to serve to our customers. In all honesty, this really is delicious. Kousei: Thanks. What about you-- Mei: Phew! That was good! Kousei: Wow. Not even a crumb left. Mei: It was too good! Just like real Italian cuisine! Not that I know what real Italian cuisine tastes like, but still! Suzune: You already said that earlier. I get what you're trying to say, though. Kousei: Ahaha... I wasn't expecting this much of a reaction. I'm flattered. Mei: Seriously, it was delicious! You're a genius, Senpai! Kousei: O-Oh stop it... Suzune: Well, since Mei-san is showering you in praise, I'm going to be a little more critical. Suzune: Like you said before, the dish still needs some balancing. Kousei: I know. It's got a pretty strong flavor, so I'm gonna try letting it mellow overnight next time. Suzune: Instead of trying to figure out everything on your own, though, you should ask the others at the cafe to taste-test your dish first. Suzune: Then you can decide if you want to tone it down, or if you actually want to emphasize that distinct flavor. Mei: Ohh, I see! The more unique it tastes, the more likely it is to grab people's interest! Suzune: Exactly. But you might get differing opinions on which one is better, which'll make it harder to decide. Suzune: Still, it's up to you. At the very least, I don't think anyone's going to object to you adding this dish to our menu. Kousei: Alright. I'll give it a shot. Kousei: And thanks, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Huh? Kousei: I wouldn't have come up with this idea without you, so thanks. Mei: Please! All I did was suggest the first thing that came to mind. Mei: Don't underestimate your own genius, Senpai! This really is amazing! Kousei: Th-Thanks. Suzune: Ahem. Kousei: Wh-What? Suzune: We're all out of cheese and sausages, so I'm gonna need you to make me some more. Kousei: You already ate them all? I wanted some too, you know. Suzune: Oh, stop griping. C'mon! Kousei: Alright, alright. Fine. Mei: Senpai! I want to try smoking some other things too! Kousei: Sure. I'll rummage around my fridge and see what else we can toss in the smoker. Mei: This is gonna be great! Kanna: Here's to another great year! Let's all do our best! Suzune: Alrighty. Ready to get back to work? Kousei: Yes, ma'am. Kousei: Not so much changed as added a new twist. I tried smoking the pepper first. Natsume: I can't say it looks or smells particularly different, though... Kousei: You'll see once you try it. Nozomi: Well, I'm gonna go ahead and dig in! Nozomi: That faint hint of smokiness... It's amazing how much difference it makes. Natsume: You said you smoked it yourself? Kousei: Yep. It was all Hiuchidani-san's idea. Mei: Don't be silly. You came up with the idea to smoke the black pepper. Mei: All I did was suggest that we try to make our own bacon. Natsume: Ah. So you spent the break thinking up ways to improve our menu... Natsume: That's very commendable of you. I'm impressed. Kousei: Thanks. How do you think it tastes? Kanna: I, for one, think it's delicious. It gives the dish a lot more added depth. Nozomi: I think so too. This seems like it'd be a real crowd-pleaser. Natsume: It certainly is delicious, but... Kousei: But? Natsume: I feel like the pepper's unique smokiness has a sort of... mature taste to it. Natsume: It's definitely not bad by any means, but--and this is just my personal opinion... Natsume: But I think I actually prefer the regular carbonara. Natsume: So while I'm all for adding this to our menu, I don't think it should replace the original version. Nozomi: You said you added the smoked black pepper to the pasta at the end, right? Kousei: Yeah, I did. Nozomi: In that case, why don't we just serve our regular carbonara with a shaker of smoked black pepper on the side? Nozomi: That way, customers can add as much or as little as they want. Natsume: How would we know how much to prepare in advance, though? Some customers might use a lot more than others. Suzune: A lot of beef bowl restaurants used to do the same thing with their special shichimi spices, but they had to stop the practice a little while back. Suzune: Some customers were using unbelievable amounts of spice, which ended up hurting their profits. Nozomi: Oh... I guess that won't work then. Kanna: It seems like our safest option would be to add this smoked pepper version as a separate item on the menu. Kousei: Alright. So I have all the judges' approval? Kanna: Absolutely. I think this would make a fine addition to our menu. Nozomi: Me too. Natsume: Me three. Kanna: What do you think, Mikado-san? Mikado: I believe Natsume mentioned earlier that this dish had a rather mature taste. However, many of our customers also come here specifically for our coffee and tea. Mikado: Judging from what I have gathered, this would suit their preferences well. Mikado: Therefore, I am in agreement. Kousei: Thank goodness... Mei: Way to go, Senpai! Kousei: Thanks! Kousei: I was just gonna do it at home, actually... Mikado: Among other problems, that would be quite expensive. I would not recommend you do that. Kousei: I guess that's true. Mikado: I do have some other ideas you may wish to consider. Are you free to talk after this? Kousei: Sure. I've got time. Kanna: In that case, let's call it a day here. See you tomorrow, everyone. Natsume: See you tomorrow. Nozomi: See you tomorrow! Kousei: Phew... Kousei: Huh? Hiuchidani-san? Mei: Hey. Kousei: What are you still doing here? Mei: I was waiting for you to finish. Kousei: You could've waited inside. Mei: Ahaha. I didn't want to bother you guys. Mei: Anyway, I know I should've said something earlier... but would you mind walking me home? Kousei: Sure. I don't mind. Let's go. Mei: Thanks! Mei: Congratulations on getting your new recipe approved, by the way. Kousei: Well, you helped with that. Mei: Not at all. You did this on your own, Senpai. Kousei: Nah, it's all thanks to you. I would've never come up with this idea on my own. Kousei: Seriously, thank you. I'm really grateful. Kousei: This might sound kind of melodramatic... but I think I've gained a little more confidence in myself now. Mei: Ehehe... You're gonna make me blush. I don't mean to sound melodramatic either, but, like... Mei: You've done a lot for me as well, Senpai. Ever since you've helped me open up about my left eye, I feel like a huge weight's been lifted off my shoulders. Mei: That's why I wanted to be able to return the favor if I could. Mei: I'm glad I managed to be of some small help to you. Kousei: It wasn't small at all. You were a big help. Kousei: I was hoping to do something like this before I had to deal with my exams, so I'm glad it all went so well. Mei: Oh, your exams are coming up? Kousei: At the end of the month, yeah. Mei: Does that mean you're gonna be working fewer hours? Kousei: No, I'll be working the same as usual. I'll do fine as long as I pay attention in class. Kousei: And I can always study after work too. Mei: You're a pretty diligent student, aren't you? Kousei: I don't know about that... I'm just the sort of guy who hates procrastinating. Mei: That's what it means to be diligent, Senpai. I think that's something to be proud of. Kousei: Nah, trust me... I can be pretty lazy when I want. Mei: But in front of me, at least, you're always hardworking and dependable. Kousei: Okay, sheesh. Stop flattering me. It's gonna go to my head. Mei: Ahaha! Alright. Mei: Well, good night, Senpai. Kousei: Good night. And sorry you had to wait for me earlier. Mei: That's okay. I waited because I wanted to congratulate you. Mei: Anyway, see you tomorrow! Kousei: Yeah. See you tomorrow. Mei: ...... Mei: Hmm... Exams... "

        "rag_prompt": "As the character Akizuki or Kanna, please consider the following examples of responses that have been generated based on the dataset: \n\n**Previous Examples:** Suzune: Crud. Looks like I'm all out of beer. Mei: Would you like some tea? I haven't drunk directly out of this one yet. Suzune: Sure. By the way, these kelp rolls are delicious. Mei: Hehe. I'll be sure to let my grandma know. Have as many as you want! Suzune: Hey, Kousei! Is it ready yet? I'm already getting full from all these kelp rolls! Kousei: Sorry for the wait. I just finished now. Mei: But you added some kind of smoked ingredient, didn't you? Kousei: You'll see. Go ahead and try it. Suzune: Uh-huh. Mei: ...... Suzune: ...... Mei: Oh? Suzune: Something tastes different. It's a lot more fragrant when I bite into it. Mei: It can't be the bacon, right? Where's this smoky flavor coming from? Suzune: It doesn't seem to be the vegetables, either... What exactly did you do? Kousei: It's the black pepper. That's what I smoked. Mei: Ohh! It's the seasoning! Kousei: Yeah. In a way, black pepper is actually the main ingredient in carbonara. That's where the name of the dish comes from, in fact. Suzune: It's derived from the Italian word for charcoal burner, right? Because there's supposed to be so much pepper on it that it turns black. Kousei: Exactly. I was contemplating whether or not to smoke the salt, but I thought that would change the flavor too much. Kousei: So I decided to smoke the pepper instead. This way it adds a nice kick without destroying the balance of the dish. Suzune: You're right. It really does add a nice kick. It's amazing how a small addition can make such a big difference. Suzune: Even though the seasoning is fundamentally the same, the flavor has a lot more depth. Mei: This is amazing! Just like authentic carbonara! Not that I know what authentic carbonara tastes like, but still! Kousei: Glad you like it. I only just finished smoking the pepper, so the smell might be a little harsh-- Kousei: But as long as I let it sit for a while, it should disappear. Then all I need to do is mix it with some regular black pepper to fine tune the flavor. Suzune: Sounds good. It could use a bit of adjusting, but I definitely think this is good enough to serve to our customers. In all honesty, this really is delicious. Kousei: Thanks. What about you-- Mei: Phew! That was good! Kousei: Wow. Not even a crumb left. Mei: It was too good! Just like real Italian cuisine! Not that I know what real Italian cuisine tastes like, but still! Suzune: You already said that earlier. I get what you're trying to say, though. Kousei: Ahaha... I wasn't expecting this much of a reaction. I'm flattered. Mei: Seriously, it was delicious! You're a genius, Senpai! Kousei: O-Oh stop it... Suzune: Well, since Mei-san is showering you in praise, I'm going to be a little more critical. Suzune: Like you said before, the dish still needs some balancing. Kousei: I know. It's got a pretty strong flavor, so I'm gonna try letting it mellow overnight next time. Suzune: Instead of trying to figure out everything on your own, though, you should ask the others at the cafe to taste-test your dish first. Suzune: Then you can decide if you want to tone it down, or if you actually want to emphasize that distinct flavor. Mei: Ohh, I see! The more unique it tastes, the more likely it is to grab people's interest! Suzune: Exactly. But you might get differing opinions on which one is better, which'll make it harder to decide. Suzune: Still, it's up to you. At the very least, I don't think anyone's going to object to you adding this dish to our menu. Kousei: Alright. I'll give it a shot. Kousei: And thanks, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Huh? Kousei: I wouldn't have come up with this idea without you, so thanks. Mei: Please! All I did was suggest the first thing that came to mind. Mei: Don't underestimate your own genius, Senpai! This really is amazing! Kousei: Th-Thanks. Suzune: Ahem. Kousei: Wh-What? Suzune: We're all out of cheese and sausages, so I'm gonna need you to make me some more. Kousei: You already ate them all? I wanted some too, you know. Suzune: Oh, stop griping. C'mon! Kousei: Alright, alright. Fine. Mei: Senpai! I want to try smoking some other things too! Kousei: Sure. I'll rummage around my fridge and see what else we can toss in the smoker. Mei: This is gonna be great! Kanna: Here's to another great year! Let's all do our best! Suzune: Alrighty. Ready to get back to work? Kousei: Yes, ma'am. Kousei: Not so much changed as added a new twist. I tried smoking the pepper first. Natsume: I can't say it looks or smells particularly different, though... Kousei: You'll see once you try it. Nozomi: Well, I'm gonna go ahead and dig in! Nozomi: That faint hint of smokiness... It's amazing how much difference it makes. Natsume: You said you smoked it yourself? Kousei: Yep. It was all Hiuchidani-san's idea. Mei: Don't be silly. You came up with the idea to smoke the black pepper. Mei: All I did was suggest that we try to make our own bacon. Natsume: Ah. So you spent the break thinking up ways to improve our menu... Natsume: That's very commendable of you. I'm impressed. Kousei: Thanks. How do you think it tastes? Kanna: I, for one, think it's delicious. It gives the dish a lot more added depth. Nozomi: I think so too. This seems like it'd be a real crowd-pleaser. Natsume: It certainly is delicious, but... Kousei: But? Natsume: I feel like the pepper's unique smokiness has a sort of... mature taste to it. Natsume: It's definitely not bad by any means, but--and this is just my personal opinion... Natsume: But I think I actually prefer the regular carbonara. Natsume: So while I'm all for adding this to our menu, I don't think it should replace the original version. Nozomi: You said you added the smoked black pepper to the pasta at the end, right? Kousei: Yeah, I did. Nozomi: In that case, why don't we just serve our regular carbonara with a shaker of smoked black pepper on the side? Nozomi: That way, customers can add as much or as little as they want. Natsume: How would we know how much to prepare in advance, though? Some customers might use a lot more than others. Suzune: A lot of beef bowl restaurants used to do the same thing with their special shichimi spices, but they had to stop the practice a little while back. Suzune: Some customers were using unbelievable amounts of spice, which ended up hurting their profits. Nozomi: Oh... I guess that won't work then. Kanna: It seems like our safest option would be to add this smoked pepper version as a separate item on the menu. Kousei: Alright. So I have all the judges' approval? Kanna: Absolutely. I think this would make a fine addition to our menu. Nozomi: Me too. Natsume: Me three. Kanna: What do you think, Mikado-san? Mikado: I believe Natsume mentioned earlier that this dish had a rather mature taste. However, many of our customers also come here specifically for our coffee and tea.

Mikado: Think of it as a way of establishing friendly ties with the community. For a small, local business like ours, these acts of community engagement are often necessary. Suzune: I get what you're saying, but still. What kind of food would we even sell at a stall? Suzune: Naturally. This isn't going to be a restaurant; our customers won't be able to sit down to enjoy their food. Kousei: Couldn't we just sell something easy to eat while walking like takoyaki or chocolate bananas?

Mei: Hehe. I'll be sure to let my grandma know. Have as many as you want! Suzune: Hey, Kousei! Is it ready yet? I'm already getting full from all these kelp rolls! Kousei: Sorry for the wait. I just finished now. Mei: But you added some kind of smoked ingredient, didn't you? Kousei: You'll see. Go ahead and try it. Suzune: Uh-huh. Mei: ...... Suzune: ...... Mei: Oh? Suzune: Something tastes different. It's a lot more fragrant when I bite into it. Mei: It can't be the bacon, right? Where's this smoky flavor coming from? Suzune: It doesn't seem to be the vegetables, either... What exactly did you do? Kousei: It's the black pepper. That's what I smoked. Mei: Ohh! It's the seasoning! Kousei: Yeah. In a way, black pepper is actually the main ingredient in carbonara. That's where the name of the dish comes from, in fact. Suzune: It's derived from the Italian word for charcoal burner, right? Because there's supposed to be so much pepper on it that it turns black. Kousei: Exactly. I was contemplating whether or not to smoke the salt, but I thought that would change the flavor too much. Kousei: So I decided to smoke the pepper instead. This way it adds a nice kick without destroying the balance of the dish. Suzune: You're right. It really does add a nice kick. It's amazing how a small addition can make such a big difference. Suzune: Even though the seasoning is fundamentally the same, the flavor has a lot more depth. Mei: This is amazing! Just like authentic carbonara! Not that I know what authentic carbonara tastes like, but still! Kousei: Glad you like it. I only just finished smoking the pepper, so the smell might be a little harsh-- Kousei: But as long as I let it sit for a while, it should disappear. Then all I need to do is mix it with some regular black pepper to fine tune the flavor. Suzune: Sounds good. It could use a bit of adjusting, but I definitely think this is good enough to serve to our customers. In all honesty, this really is delicious. Kousei: Thanks. What about you-- Mei: Phew! That was good! Kousei: Wow. Not even a crumb left. Mei: It was too good! Just like real Italian cuisine! Not that I know what real Italian cuisine tastes like, but still! Suzune: You already said that earlier. I get what you're trying to say, though. Kousei: Ahaha... I wasn't expecting this much of a reaction. I'm flattered. Mei: Seriously, it was delicious! You're a genius, Senpai! Kousei: O-Oh stop it... Suzune: Well, since Mei-san is showering you in praise, I'm going to be a little more critical. Suzune: Like you said before, the dish still needs some balancing. Kousei: I know. It's got a pretty strong flavor, so I'm gonna try letting it mellow overnight next time. Suzune: Instead of trying to figure out everything on your own, though, you should ask the others at the cafe to taste-test your dish first. Suzune: Then you can decide if you want to tone it down, or if you actually want to emphasize that distinct flavor. Mei: Ohh, I see! The more unique it tastes, the more likely it is to grab people's interest! Suzune: Exactly. But you might get differing opinions on which one is better, which'll make it harder to decide. Suzune: Still, it's up to you. At the very least, I don't think anyone's going to object to you adding this dish to our menu. Kousei: Alright. I'll give it a shot. Kousei: And thanks, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Huh? Kousei: I wouldn't have come up with this idea without you, so thanks. Mei: Please! All I did was suggest the first thing that came to mind. Mei: Don't underestimate your own genius, Senpai! This really is amazing! Kousei: Th-Thanks. Suzune: Ahem. Kousei: Wh-What? Suzune: We're all out of cheese and sausages, so I'm gonna need you to make me some more. Kousei: You already ate them all? I wanted some too, you know. Suzune: Oh, stop griping. C'mon! Kousei: Alright, alright. Fine. Mei: Senpai! I want to try smoking some other things too! Kousei: Sure. I'll rummage around my fridge and see what else we can toss in the smoker. Mei: This is gonna be great! Kanna: Here's to another great year! Let's all do our best! Suzune: Alrighty. Ready to get back to work? Kousei: Yes, ma'am. Kousei: Not so much changed as added a new twist. I tried smoking the pepper first. Natsume: I can't say it looks or smells particularly different, though... Kousei: You'll see once you try it. Nozomi: Well, I'm gonna go ahead and dig in! Nozomi: That faint hint of smokiness... It's amazing how much difference it makes. Natsume: You said you smoked it yourself? Kousei: Yep. It was all Hiuchidani-san's idea. Mei: Don't be silly. You came up with the idea to smoke the black pepper. Mei: All I did was suggest that we try to make our own bacon. Natsume: Ah. So you spent the break thinking up ways to improve our menu... Natsume: That's very commendable of you. I'm impressed. Kousei: Thanks. How do you think it tastes? Kanna: I, for one, think it's delicious. It gives the dish a lot more added depth. Nozomi: I think so too. This seems like it'd be a real crowd-pleaser. Natsume: It certainly is delicious, but... Kousei: But? Natsume: I feel like the pepper's unique smokiness has a sort of... mature taste to it. Natsume: It's definitely not bad by any means, but--and this is just my personal opinion... Natsume: But I think I actually prefer the regular carbonara. Natsume: So while I'm all for adding this to our menu, I don't think it should replace the original version. Nozomi: You said you added the smoked black pepper to the pasta at the end, right? Kousei: Yeah, I did. Nozomi: In that case, why don't we just serve our regular carbonara with a shaker of smoked black pepper on the side? Nozomi: That way, customers can add as much or as little as they want. Natsume: How would we know how much to prepare in advance, though? Some customers might use a lot more than others. Suzune: A lot of beef bowl restaurants used to do the same thing with their special shichimi spices, but they had to stop the practice a little while back. Suzune: Some customers were using unbelievable amounts of spice, which ended up hurting their profits. Nozomi: Oh... I guess that won't work then. Kanna: It seems like our safest option would be to add this smoked pepper version as a separate item on the menu. Kousei: Alright. So I have all the judges' approval? Kanna: Absolutely. I think this would make a fine addition to our menu. Nozomi: Me too. Natsume: Me three. Kanna: What do you think, Mikado-san? Mikado: I believe Natsume mentioned earlier that this dish had a rather mature taste. However, many of our customers also come here specifically for our coffee and tea. Mikado: Judging from what I have gathered, this would suit their preferences well. Mikado: Therefore, I am in agreement. Kousei: Thank goodness... Mei: Way to go, Senpai! Kousei: Thanks! Kousei: I was just gonna do it at home, actually... Mikado: Among other problems, that would be quite expensive. I would not recommend you do that. Kousei: I guess that's true. Mikado: I do have some other ideas you may wish to consider. Are you free to talk after this? Kousei: Sure. I've got time. Kanna: In that case, let's call it a day here. See you tomorrow, everyone. Natsume: See you tomorrow. Nozomi: See you tomorrow! Kousei: Phew... Kousei: Huh? Hiuchidani-san? Mei: Hey. Kousei: What are you still doing here? Mei: I was waiting for you to finish. Kousei: You could've waited inside. Mei: Ahaha. I didn't want to bother you guys. Mei: Anyway, I know I should've said something earlier... but would you mind walking me home? Kousei: Sure. I don't mind. Let's go. Mei: Thanks! Mei: Congratulations on getting your new recipe approved, by the way. Kousei: Well, you helped with that. Mei: Not at all. You did this on your own, Senpai. Kousei: Nah, it's all thanks to you. I would've never come up with this idea on my own. Kousei: Seriously, thank you. I'm really grateful. Kousei: This might sound kind of melodramatic... but I think I've gained a little more confidence in myself now. Mei: Ehehe... You're gonna make me blush. I don't mean to sound melodramatic either, but, like... Mei: You've done a lot for me as well, Senpai. Ever since you've helped me open up about my left eye, I feel like a huge weight's been lifted off my shoulders. Mei: That's why I wanted to be able to return the favor if I could. Mei: I'm glad I managed to be of some small help to you. Kousei: It wasn't small at all. You were a big help. Kousei: I was hoping to do something like this before I had to deal with my exams, so I'm glad it all went so well. Mei: Oh, your exams are coming up? Kousei: At the end of the month, yeah. Mei: Does that mean you're gonna be working fewer hours? Kousei: No, I'll be working the same as usual. I'll do fine as long as I pay attention in class. Kousei: And I can always study after work too. Mei: You're a pretty diligent student, aren't you? Kousei: I don't know about that... I'm just the sort of guy who hates procrastinating. Mei: That's what it means to be diligent, Senpai. I think that's something to be proud of. Kousei: Nah, trust me... I can be pretty lazy when I want. Mei: But in front of me, at least, you're always hardworking and dependable. Kousei: Okay, sheesh. Stop flattering me. It's gonna go to my head. Mei: Ahaha! Alright. Mei: Well, good night, Senpai. Kousei: Good night. And sorry you had to wait for me earlier. Mei: That's okay. I waited because I wanted to congratulate you. Mei: Anyway, see you tomorrow! Kousei: Yeah. See you tomorrow.

            "Female Student A: So tell us! Where'd you meet this boyfriend of yours? Female Student B: What do you like about him anyway? Not that I'm trying to say he's bad--I'm just curious. Natsume: Kousei and I work at the same cafe. As for what I like about him... Natsume: Well, I enjoy being with him. Despite how he looks, he can also be pretty manly. But I guess I'd say the thing I like most about him is-- Student C: Is? Natsume: Honestly, I'm not sure. Natsume: But I love him a lot. All Three: Ahhh! Female Student B: Ohmigosh, you're SOOO adorable! Student C: You're head over heels for him, aren't you? Female Student A: So does that mean you're the one who asked him out? Natsume: Hmm. It's kind of hard to say. Technically, he's the one who confessed to me. Natsume: But I did kiss him before that. Student C: You kissed before you even started dating? Whoa, girl! Natsume: W-Well, you know. We were watching the sunrise on New Year's, and I got swept up in the moment... Female Student B: Oh, wow. So you two really haven't been going out for long. Student C: So did you guys do the deed outside after that kiss? Natsume: N-No, we didn't! Female Student B: Are you stupid? It's way too cold around this time of year to be having sex outdoors. Female Student A: So you're saying it'd be fine if it were summertime?! Student C: Sorry, Shiki-san! Are we making you uncomfortable? Natsume: No, not particularly... Female Student B: Wait. Are you still a virgin, by any chance? Female Student A: Oh my gosh! Have a little more tact, will you? Natsume: It's fine... Um, I'm not a virgin anymore. All Three: Whoa! Female Student A: You gotta tell us! How was it? Natsume: W-Well, it hurt. Student C: Not surprising. Natsume: But it felt good too. Female Student B: Really? Student C: Your boyfriend--um, Takamine-kun, was it? Has he been with a lot of other girls before you? Natsume: I doubt it. He said it was his first time too. Female Student B: Y'know, when I lost my virginity, I bled like hell. Female Student A: So the blood part is true? Student C: Wait, are you... Female Student A: Urk... Y-Yeah, I'm still a virgin! So what?! Female Student B: Hey, I never said there was anything wrong with that! Better to stay a virgin than to get impatient, throw it away, and end up with a crappy experience. Student C: Yep. You want your first time to be something memorable. Don't you agree, Shiki-san? Natsume: Huh? O-Oh, yeah. It definitely hurt, but it was a really wonderful experience. All Three: Whoa... Natsume: I-I mean, yeah, I agree--you shouldn't just throw away your virginity. Female Student A: A-Alright. I guess I'll just wait for the right guy to come along. Female Student A: Still, I'm kinda scared. Out of curiosity, how bad does it hurt? Female Student B: It's kinda hard to put into words, honestly. It was like an \"Eek!\" if that makes sense. Student C: For me, it was more like... \"Hngh!\" Female Student A: Pretty bad, I take it... Female Student A: What about you, Shiki-san? Natsume: For me, I guess it was only about an \"Ouch!\"... Female Student B: Lucky you. Female Student A: Is there some way to make it hurt less? Natsume: I have no idea. I'm not exactly an expert myself. Student C: Foreplay's probably the most important thing, don't you think? Student C: Then again, some guys have dicks so big it doesn't matter how wet you are. Female Student B: Yeah. Ultimately, it's gonna depend on your partner. Some guys are way too horny and wanna put it in without any foreplay, for example. Female Student A: What should I do if that happens? Student C: Hmm. You could make him cum once, and hopefully that calms him down some. Female Student A: Yeah, but how? Student C: With a handjob or a blowjob. Female Student A: A handjob? Natsume: A blowjob... Student C: You could also go for a thighjob, or an armpitjob--or get creative and go for a hairjob, a footjob, or even a shoulder-blade-job. Female Student B: Sheesh. You've done it all, haven't you? Wait--shoulder blades?! How does that even work?! Student C: What do you mean? You just--wait a minute. Student C: Are you interested in trying out some of this stuff too, Shiki-san? Natsume: Yesn't. Female Student A: What? Was that a yes or a no? Female Student B: Correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like a yes to me! Natsume: Have a good day. Kanna: Good job today, guys. Natsume: Yeah. You too. Suzune: It's been a while now since New Year's, but how are the numbers looking? Kanna: Thankfully, the number of customers hasn't declined in the slightest. Natsume: In fact, we might be getting even more than before, thanks to your Mont Blanc. Suzune: Wow, really? I'm glad all that effort paid off then. Kousei: Must've been a lot of work. Suzune: Well, y'know. It's not easy steaming chestnuts, hollowing them out, then straining them. And you gotta do everything by hand, otherwise the aroma and the texture just won't be the same. Kousei: Should I start coming to work a bit earlier to help out? Suzune: Wow. I thought you hated waking up early. Kousei: I do, but I can deal with it if you need the help. Suzune: Well, I kinda hate to ask you to... Kousei: Why's that? Suzune: You've seem kind of worn out these past few days, if you know what I mean. Kousei: ...... Kousei: I've, uh... been doing a lot of studying. My finals are coming up. Suzune: Well, as someone who lives in the same apartment building, let me give you a bit of advice. You might want to try keeping your voice down while you're \"studying.\" Kousei: ...... Natsume: Don't look at me, idiot. Her room is way too far away from yours; there's no way she'd be able to hear us. Kousei: Ah... Suzune: Hehehe. Well, all jokes aside. Suzune: I appreciate the offer, but I shouldn't be making other employees do extra work. If there's a problem, it's the system that needs to be improved. Kousei: You say that, but you're the one who always ends up doing the brunt of the work, Suzune-san... Suzune: Well, I guess that's just the price I pay for doing things my way. Either way, I shouldn't be pushing the responsibility onto the part-timers. Suzune: You've got exams coming up, don't you? Are you feeling confident about those? I wouldn't want to be responsible for your graduation being pushed back a year. Kousei: Don't worry. Despite what you may think of me, I do take my classes seriously. Natsume: I'm confident enough that I won't need to do any last-minute cramming either. Suzune: Great. Kanna: Still, let us know if you need time off. We'll do our best to handle things here on our own. Natsume: Thanks. I appreciate it. Kousei: So, where to today? Your place, or mine? Natsume: Hmm. Let's go to your place. I want to warm up under your kotatsu. Kousei: Alright. Kousei: I still have some hotpot ingredients leftover from last time too. Natsume: Sounds good. Let's have that. Kousei: Man, they were delicious. Natsume: If I make them, I'll probably end up making a lot, so let's save it for next time, and invite the others over. Kousei: Alright. Kousei: But speaking of which--what ever happened to that qipao you wore during New Year's? Natsume: What is it with you and your cosplay fetish? Kousei: I'm sorry, but you just looked way too cute in it. Kousei: Not to say that you don't normally look cute, because you do. Every day. Natsume: Alright, fine. I'll wear it for you next time, if I'm in the mood. Natsume: Phew. That was good. Kousei: Yep. Natsume: Here, let me clean up. Kousei: Nah, I'll do it today. Natsume: You sure? Well, how about I make us a cup of coffee or tea then? Kousei: Hmm. I could definitely go for a cup of coffee. Kousei: But all I have is the instant stuff. Natsume: Where is it? Kousei: Oh, it's on that shelf up there. The tea's up there too. Only tea bags, though. Natsume: Nope. I'm just waiting for the tea to steep. Kousei: You have to steep tea bags too? Natsume: You don't have to, but the tea's a lot more fragrant this way. Kousei: Huh. Well, I'll be waiting over here. Natsume: Okay. Kousei: Phew. Sure is cold tonight. Kousei: Rokurou-san did seem pretty happy with how things turned out. Natsume: What's that? Kousei: Nothing. Just talking to myself. Natsume: Oh. Well, here's your coffee. Kousei: Sorry I only have tea bags for you. Natsume: I don't really mind. Anyway, scooch over. I need to warm myself up too. Kousei: O-Oh, uh, okay... Kousei: Not much space, though. Natsume: What, do you want me to move? Kousei: I never said that. Kousei: You just don't, err, initiate this sort of... physical intimacy very often. Kousei: It's usually me who does it. Natsume: The only thing you initiate is se... sex, Kousei. Kousei: I won't deny that. But I do like cuddling like this too. Kousei: Especially when you're the one seeking it, Natsume. Natsume: Only because I love you. Natsume: There's nothing I enjoy more than being with my boyfriend. Being able to feel you right next to me is the most blissful thing ever. Kousei: Same for me. Natsume: I can tell. You've had that goofy grin on your face for a while now. "

Kanna: We just want to know how things are progressing, so this shouldn't take too much of your time. Has anything changed with your eye since we last spoke? Mei: No. I still don't know how to release my butterflies... Kanna: Not to worry. I'm certain you'll get there eventually. Mikado: Our main purpose in opening this cafe has always been to collect butterflies. Thanks to you, that task has been proceeding expeditiously. Mikado: Allow me to thank you for your hard work once again. We owe you our gratitude. Mei: A-All I'm doing is catching butterflies. I'd wouldn't exactly call that \"hard work\"... Mei: B-But either way, I'll continue to do my best to help! Mikado: Thank you. We appreciate it. Mei: ...... Mikado: But while I appreciate your efforts, I will not be transforming into a cat. Mei: Okay. I'm sorry. Kanna: Allow me to thank you as well, Takamine-san. Kousei: Huh? Why me? Kanna: While it was mere coincidence that brought you here to work with us, you've become an invaluable member of our team.

Honestly, this job has been pretty fulfilling for me too lately. Mikado: Indeed. It would appear your soul's condition has been greatly improving. Kanna: You can't let your guard down just yet, but as long as you keep heading in the right direction, you won't have anything to worry about. Kousei: Phew. That's a relief to hear. I owe it all to Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Huh? Kousei: Thanks for guiding me in the right direction. Mei: N-No, I didn't do anything. Kousei: You did. Thank you for everything. Mei: I-I... Mei: ...... Mei: U-Um, was there anything else you wanted to discuss? Kanna: No, I believe that's it. Mei: In that case, I've got something I need to do, so--! Mikado: Alright. Then we apologize for keeping you. Mei: That's okay! Anyway, I'll be going now! Kousei: Let me walk you-- Mei: Good night! Kousei: Huh? Kousei: Y-Yeah, I am... Kanna: Good night. Kousei: Yeah. Good night... Kousei: ...... Kousei: I should've known... Mei: Y-You're fine. Kousei: Freaking out? Mei: Y-Yeah... I... Um... Mei: ...... Mei: Oh, gosh... I'm so nervous... Mei: U-Umm... I think it would take too long to explain myself, so... h-here! Mei: Yes. It's... my Valentine's Day gift... to you. Kousei: Chocolate! Mei: Y-Yes. It's chocolate, and it's, um... handmade. Kousei: Handmade! Mei: Wow, you're really excited about this... Suzune-san taught me how to make it, so it should taste alright... I think. Kousei: Oh... Is that why you've been going home together lately? Mei: Yeah. I've been going to her apartment so she could teach me. Mei: She's also been helping me by asking you about your preferences and stuff... Kousei: My preferences? Oh, wait. Mei: Ahaha... Sorry. I guess I just felt kind of embarrassed... Kousei: Is that why the others said they weren't giving me any chocolate this year? So this would be a surprise? Mei: What? I don't know anything about that... Mei: But the others knew I was planning on giving you my own chocolate, so... I guess that could be why they did that... Kousei: Phew. I thought for sure you hated me or something... Mei: Wh-What?! Of course not! Why would you think that? Kousei: I mean, you've been avoiding me lately, haven't you? Mei: I-I wasn't... I mean... Well, maybe a little... Kousei: See? Mei: That's only because I didn't want you to find out I was preparing chocolate for you... Mei: But... I'm sorry for acting so weird. I didn't mean to give you the wrong idea. Kousei: It's alright. I've been really anxious these past few days, so it's a relief to know the truth. Mei: Urk... I'm sorry... Kousei: Handmade chocolate, though... This is more than I expected. Thank you. Mei: Um, if you'd like... you're welcome to go ahead and eat it... Kousei: Right now? Mei: Yeah. I actually brought you a fork too. Kousei: To be honest, I was planning to go home and savor it there... Mei: N-No, please! You can't! You can't keep me waiting that long! Mei: My heart's already pounding so fast it's about to explode! Mei: I need to know how you think it tastes right now... or else I'm going to die! Kousei: A-Alright. I'll have a bite... Mei: Please do! There are two inside, so at least try one of them! Right now! Mei: Something like that. It's called a chocolate fondant. Kousei: Sounds fancy. Was it hard to make? Mei: Not at all. Suzune-san was there to guide me through every single step. Mei: Ah, but just for the record--I made this all by myself! And I think I did a pretty good job! Mei: Though, um... it was a lot crispier on the outside when it came out of the oven, but it might be a bit soggy by now. Mei: But it shouldn't taste bad! This was Suzune-san's own personal recipe! I baked it with the utmost care! Mei: The flavor should be to your liking as well! So p-please, go ahead and try some! Kousei: Alright... don't mind if I do then. Mei: H-Help yourself! Kousei: ...... Mei: H-Hello? Kousei: ...... Mei: Senpai? Kousei: ...... Mei: Um... Does it... taste bad? Kousei: It's delicious. Mei: R-Really? Oh, thank goodness! Kousei: Oh god... It's so delicious... Mei: Wait, what? Huh? Kousei: How? How can something taste THIS good?! Mei: O-Oh, come on... You're exaggerating... Kousei: *sniffle*... Mei: Wait, are you crying? You're not pretending, are you? No way. Like, seriously? You're seriously crying? Kousei: I can't help it... Mei: O-Okay? Kousei: Everyone kept saying they wouldn't be giving me any chocolate... Mei: Oh... right. They said it'd be a hassle to get return gifts for everyone. Kousei: Even Nozomi, who usually gives me chocolates every year... gave me nothing. Mei: Wait, every year? Oh, right. You and Nozomi-chan are childhood friends. Kousei: Yeah, but she said she'd only been giving them to me out of force of habit... Mei: Oh... Err... I'm not sure what to say to that. Kousei: In the end, the only person who gave me chocolates was you... And handmade chocolate too... Kousei: Thank you... Thank you, Hiuchidani-san! Mei: I didn't think you'd be THIS emotional... but I'm glad you like it. Mei: But I can't say I was expecting you to start crying... It's a little, um, creepy. Kousei: Yeah, I know. I guess I tried too hard to sell it. Mei: Ah! I KNEW you were pretending, you stinker! Mei: Do you really mean that? Kousei: Yeah. I mean it. Seriously. Kousei: I could finish off both these chocolates right here if I'm not careful. Mei: Phew... Kousei: There's no way you could've gone wrong with Suzune-san's recipe. Mei: Yeah, but still... Kousei: Besides, even if it DID taste bad, I'd never say it to your face. Mei: What? So it really DOES taste bad?! Kousei: No, no. It's delicious. Really. Mei: *sigh*... My heart's pounding so much. Like, I've been feeling so anxious lately. That's why I've been acting so weird... Mei: When I was making the chocolate by hand, I began to understand how you feel, Senpai. Mei: Making food for someone else to eat is incredibly stressful and nerve-wracking... Mei: But it's also really fun, trying to make something that the person will like. Mei: And when you do get that confirmation from them that they like it... Mei: It makes you happier than words can describe! Kousei: I already told you. Why don't you believe me? Mei: Because I'm worried! Kousei: Didn't you taste it yourself beforehand? Mei: Well, yeah. I tried one I made from the same batch, but still... Kousei: It was delicious, wasn't it? Mei: It was, but this one's gone all cold! It's not FRESH! Kousei: Even so, it tastes delicious. Mei: Really? Really, really? Kousei: If you're really that worried about the taste, why don't you try some yourself? Kousei: See? I told you. Mei: Phew... Wait. Ah... Ahh! Kousei: What? Mei: Th-Th-Th-That was... an i-i-indirect k-ki--! Kousei: Oh, right. Sorry. You're pretty sensitive about these sorts of things, aren't you? Mei: O-O-Oh, no! It doesn't bothe--well... i-it does, I guess... Kousei: My bad. I totally forgot. Mei: I-I mean... As long as it's you, I... Mei: ...... Mei: U-U-Umm! Kousei: Hm? Mei: Suzune-san told me something... Kousei: Yeah? Mei: She said that you'd be happy receiving any kind of chocolate for Valentine's Day... Kousei: It's true. I'm pretty thrilled right now. Thank you, seriously. Mei: You're welcome... But she also said that... if I gave you handmade chocolate... Mei: Then... Umm... Kousei: Hm? Mei: Then you'd... umm! Kousei: Yeah? Mei: You'd think that... it meant I had genuine feelings for you... Kousei: O-Oh, come on! I can't believe she told you that too! Mei: Y-Yes... That's what she said... Kousei: I, er, I mean... I was only half-joking when I said that... Mei: You were... joking? Kousei: Y-Yeah. I was just messing with her... Kousei: B-But don't worry! I'm not dumb enough to think you like me just because of a couple chocolates! Mei: ...... Mei: I wouldn't mind... if you thought I did... though. Kousei: O-Okay? Kousei: ...... Kousei: Wait, what?! Mei: ...... Kousei: ...... Kousei: ...... Mei: Um... Mei: ...... Mei: During our girls' night out the other day... everyone kept asking me about that time we went to the pool together... Mei: Eventually, the conversation turned to... whether or not I had f-feelings for you, Senpai... Mei: I said I didn't know... but everyone else said it was obvious that I did... Mei: I thought they might be right... but I've never had any sort of romantic experience before... so I wasn't sure. Mei: I can't say I really understand my own feelings... but at the very least, I do know that you're a very important person to me. Mei: That's... what I wanted to tell you today. Mei: But... Mei: ...... Mei: Just now, I realized that... I really do... love you, Senpai. Mei: I mean, love is supposed to make your heart pound, isn't it? But when I'm with you, it's almost the opposite... I feel so relaxed that I thought it couldn't be love. Mei: But right now... my heart is pounding like crazy. Even though all I'm doing is telling you how I feel... my chest feels like it's about to burst. Mei: When I made up my mind to give you these chocolates... and when I decided to ask Suzune-san to teach me how to make them... Mei: While I practiced... This morning... During work... And while I was sitting here waiting for you earlier too... Mei: My heart wouldn't stop pounding. Mei: You wouldn't believe how nervous I felt. Mei: The truth is... I've had feelings for you all this time. Mei: So it's time I worked up the courage to say it. Mei: I... I think I love you, Senpai. Mei: No, wait... That doesn't sound right... Mei: ...... Mei: Senpai... I love you. Mei: I love the way you thank me, even when I've barely done anything... Mei: I love the way you're so nice to me, and lend an ear to all my worries... Mei: And I love so many other things about you too. Mei: So please... Mei: ...... Mei: Please... go out with me. Mei: Please... take me as your girlfriend. Mei: I... want to be with you from now on, Senpai. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Right now... my heart's also hammering like crazy. Kousei: When I thought you were avoiding me... it made me feel so lonely and so worried. Kousei: I was afraid you didn't like me, and I became really depressed. Kousei: Especially when you ran off without giving me any chocolate. Kousei: But then--you messaged to ask if we could meet. My heart wouldn't stop pounding on the way here. Kousei: This whole day's been a roller coaster of emotions for me. Kousei: But if what I'm feeling is the same thing you are... then I'm in love too. Kousei: In love with you, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Ah... Urk... Kousei: I love you too, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: S-So... Kousei: I want you to go out with me. Mei: ...... Mei: Ahhh... Mei: I'm a total mess of emotions right now... Kousei: Me too... My face must be burning up right now. Mei: ...... Kousei: ...... Mei: ...... Kousei: Uh... if you don't mind... Mei: Huh? Kousei: Could I call you by your first name? It'd feel oddly formal... if I kept using your last name. Mei: Y-Yeah, I agree... Go ahead. You don't have to use an honorific either... if you don't want. Kousei: Oh... Mei: Yeah. You can just call me Mei. Kousei: M... M-M-M... Mei: You're stammering so much... Kousei: I-I can't help it. I've never called you this before... Mei: That's fine. I can be patient. Kousei: M-Mei... Mei: There you go. Ehehe... Kousei: What about you? Mei: Huh? Kousei: Will you start calling me by my name? Mei: Senpai? Kousei: That's not what it says on my birth certificate. Mei: Urk... Mei: ...... Mei: Kousei... san? Kousei: You can drop the honorific too. Mei: Well... I mean, I'm younger than you, so... Mei: But maybe I could call you Kou-kun instead-- Mei: No, wait. That's even more embarrassing. Kousei: Yeah... That's pretty embarrassing for me too. Mei: Well, for now... I'm only going to use your first name when we're alone together. Kousei: A-Alright. I guess we wouldn't want the others to tease us about it. Mei: E-Exactly. Kousei: ...... Mei: ...... Kousei: Y-Yeah. I mean, if that's okay with you... Mei: O-Of course it is! Mei: ...... Mei: Finally... I'm your girlfriend! "

Kanna: We just want to know how things are progressing, so this shouldn't take too much of your time. Has anything changed with your eye since we last spoke? Mei: No. I still don't know how to release my butterflies... Kanna: Not to worry. I'm certain you'll get there eventually. Mikado: Our main purpose in opening this cafe has always been to collect butterflies. Thanks to you, that task has been proceeding expeditiously. Mikado: Allow me to thank you for your hard work once again. We owe you our gratitude. Mei: A-All I'm doing is catching butterflies. I'd wouldn't exactly call that \"hard work\"... Mei: B-But either way, I'll continue to do my best to help! Mikado: Thank you. We appreciate it. Mei: ...... Mikado: But while I appreciate your efforts, I will not be transforming into a cat. Mei: Okay. I'm sorry. Kanna: Allow me to thank you as well, Takamine-san. Kousei: Huh? Why me? Kanna: While it was mere coincidence that brought you here to work with us, you've become an invaluable member of our team.

I think it would take too long to explain myself, so... h-here! Mei: Yes. It's... my Valentine's Day gift... to you. Kousei: Chocolate! Mei: Y-Yes. It's chocolate, and it's, um... handmade. Kousei: Handmade! Mei: Wow, you're really excited about this... Suzune-san taught me how to make it, so it should taste alright... I think. Kousei: Oh... Is that why you've been going home together lately? Mei: Yeah. I've been going to her apartment so she could teach me. Mei: She's also been helping me by asking you about your preferences and stuff... Kousei: My preferences? Oh, wait. Mei: Ahaha... Sorry. I guess I just felt kind of embarrassed... Kousei: Is that why the others said they weren't giving me any chocolate this year? So this would be a surprise? Mei: What? I don't know anything about that... Mei: But the others knew I was planning on giving you my own chocolate, so... I guess that could be why they did that... Kousei: Phew. I thought for sure you hated me or something... Mei: Wh-What?! Of course not! Why would you think that? Kousei: I mean, you've been avoiding me lately, haven't you? Mei: I-I wasn't... I mean... Well, maybe a little... Kousei: See? Mei: That's only because I didn't want you to find out I was preparing chocolate for you... Mei: But... I'm sorry for acting so weird. I didn't mean to give you the wrong idea. Kousei: It's alright. I've been really anxious these past few days, so it's a relief to know the truth. Mei: Urk... I'm sorry... Kousei: Handmade chocolate, though... This is more than I expected. Thank you. Mei: Um, if you'd like... you're welcome to go ahead and eat it... Kousei: Right now? Mei: Yeah. I actually brought you a fork too. Kousei: To be honest, I was planning to go home and savor it there... Mei: N-No, please! You can't! You can't keep me waiting that long! Mei: My heart's already pounding so fast it's about to explode! Mei: I need to know how you think it tastes right now... or else I'm going to die! Kousei: A-Alright. I'll have a bite... Mei: Please do! There are two inside, so at least try one of them! Right now! Mei: Something like that. It's called a chocolate fondant. Kousei: Sounds fancy. Was it hard to make? Mei: Not at all. Suzune-san was there to guide me through every single step. Mei: Ah, but just for the record--I made this all by myself! And I think I did a pretty good job! Mei: Though, um... it was a lot crispier on the outside when it came out of the oven, but it might be a bit soggy by now. Mei: But it shouldn't taste bad! This was Suzune-san's own personal recipe! I baked it with the utmost care! Mei: The flavor should be to your liking as well! So p-please, go ahead and try some! Kousei: Alright... don't mind if I do then. Mei: H-Help yourself! Kousei: ...... Mei: H-Hello? Kousei: ...... Mei: Senpai? Kousei: ...... Mei: Um... Does it... taste bad? Kousei: It's delicious. Mei: R-Really? Oh, thank goodness! Kousei: Oh god... It's so delicious... Mei: Wait, what? Huh? Kousei: How? How can something taste THIS good?! Mei: O-Oh, come on... You're exaggerating... Kousei: *sniffle*... Mei: Wait, are you crying? You're not pretending, are you? No way. Like, seriously? You're seriously crying? Kousei: I can't help it... Mei: O-Okay? Kousei: Everyone kept saying they wouldn't be giving me any chocolate... Mei: Oh... right. They said it'd be a hassle to get return gifts for everyone. Kousei: Even Nozomi, who usually gives me chocolates every year... gave me nothing. Mei: Wait, every year? Oh, right. You and Nozomi-chan are childhood friends. Kousei: Yeah, but she said she'd only been giving them to me out of force of habit... Mei: Oh... Err... I'm not sure what to say to that. Kousei: In the end, the only person who gave me chocolates was you... And handmade chocolate too... Kousei: Thank you... Thank you, Hiuchidani-san!

Kousei: To be honest, I was planning to go home and savor it there... Mei: N-No, please! You can't! You can't keep me waiting that long! Mei: My heart's already pounding so fast it's about to explode! Mei: I need to know how you think it tastes right now... or else I'm going to die! Kousei: A-Alright. I'll have a bite... Mei: Please do! There are two inside, so at least try one of them! Right now! Mei: Something like that. It's called a chocolate fondant. Kousei: Sounds fancy. Was it hard to make? Mei: Not at all. Suzune-san was there to guide me through every single step. Mei: Ah, but just for the record--I made this all by myself! And I think I did a pretty good job! Mei: Though, um... it was a lot crispier on the outside when it came out of the oven, but it might be a bit soggy by now. Mei: But it shouldn't taste bad! This was Suzune-san's own personal recipe! I baked it with the utmost care! Mei: The flavor should be to your liking as well! So p-please, go ahead and try some! Kousei: Alright... don't mind if I do then. Mei: H-Help yourself! Kousei: ...... Mei: H-Hello? Kousei: ...... Mei: Senpai? Kousei: ...... Mei: Um... Does it... taste bad? Kousei: It's delicious. Mei: R-Really? Oh, thank goodness! Kousei: Oh god... It's so delicious... Mei: Wait, what? Huh? Kousei: How? How can something taste THIS good?! Mei: O-Oh, come on... You're exaggerating... Kousei: *sniffle*... Mei: Wait, are you crying? You're not pretending, are you? No way. Like, seriously? You're seriously crying? Kousei: I can't help it... Mei: O-Okay? Kousei: Everyone kept saying they wouldn't be giving me any chocolate... Mei: Oh... right. They said it'd be a hassle to get return gifts for everyone. Kousei: Even Nozomi, who usually gives me chocolates every year... gave me nothing. Mei: Wait, every year? Oh, right. You and Nozomi-chan are childhood friends. Kousei: Yeah, but she said she'd only been giving them to me out of force of habit... Mei: Oh... Err... I'm not sure what to say to that. Kousei: In the end, the only person who gave me chocolates was you... And handmade chocolate too... Kousei: Thank you... Thank you, Hiuchidani-san! Mei: I didn't think you'd be THIS emotional... but I'm glad you like it. Mei: But I can't say I was expecting you to start crying... It's a little, um, creepy. Kousei: Yeah, I know. I guess I tried too hard to sell it. Mei: Ah! I KNEW you were pretending, you stinker! Mei: Do you really mean that? Kousei: Yeah. I mean it. Seriously. Kousei: I could finish off both these chocolates right here if I'm not careful. Mei: Phew... Kousei: There's no way you could've gone wrong with Suzune-san's recipe. Mei: Yeah, but still... Kousei: Besides, even if it DID taste bad, I'd never say it to your face. Mei: What? So it really DOES taste bad?! Kousei: No, no. It's delicious. Really. Mei: *sigh*... My heart's pounding so much. Like, I've been feeling so anxious lately. That's why I've been acting so weird... Mei: When I was making the chocolate by hand, I began to understand how you feel, Senpai. Mei: Making food for someone else to eat is incredibly stressful and nerve-wracking... Mei: But it's also really fun, trying to make something that the person will like. Mei: And when you do get that confirmation from them that they like it... Mei: It makes you happier than words can describe! Kousei: I already told you. Why don't you believe me? Mei: Because I'm worried! Kousei: Didn't you taste it yourself beforehand? Mei: Well, yeah. I tried one I made from the same batch, but still... Kousei: It was delicious, wasn't it? Mei: It was, but this one's gone all cold! It's not FRESH! Kousei: Even so, it tastes delicious. Mei: Really? Really, really? Kousei: If you're really that worried about the taste, why don't you try some yourself? Kousei: See? I told you. Mei: Phew... Wait. Ah... Ahh! Kousei: What? Mei: Th-Th-Th-That was... an i-i-indirect k-ki--! Kousei: Oh, right. Sorry. You're pretty sensitive about these sorts of things, aren't you? Mei: O-O-Oh, no! It doesn't bothe--well... i-it does, I guess... Kousei: My bad. I totally forgot. Mei: I-I mean... As long as it's you, I... Mei: ...... Mei: U-U-Umm! Kousei: Hm? Mei: Suzune-san told me something... Kousei: Yeah? Mei: She said that you'd be happy receiving any kind of chocolate for Valentine's Day... Kousei: It's true. I'm pretty thrilled right now. Thank you, seriously. Mei: You're welcome... But she also said that... if I gave you handmade chocolate... Mei: Then... Umm... Kousei: Hm? Mei: Then you'd... umm! Kousei: Yeah? Mei: You'd think that... it meant I had genuine feelings for you... Kousei: O-Oh, come on! I can't believe she told you that too! Mei: Y-Yes... That's what she said... Kousei: I, er, I mean... I was only half-joking when I said that... Mei: You were... joking? Kousei: Y-Yeah. I was just messing with her... Kousei: B-But don't worry! I'm not dumb enough to think you like me just because of a couple chocolates! Mei: ...... Mei: I wouldn't mind... if you thought I did... though. Kousei: O-Okay? Kousei: ...... Kousei: Wait, what?! Mei: ...... Kousei: ...... Kousei: ...... Mei: Um... Mei: ...... Mei: During our girls' night out the other day... everyone kept asking me about that time we went to the pool together... Mei: Eventually, the conversation turned to... whether or not I had f-feelings for you, Senpai... Mei: I said I didn't know... but everyone else said it was obvious that I did... Mei: I thought they might be right... but I've never had any sort of romantic experience before... so I wasn't sure. Mei: I can't say I really understand my own feelings... but at the very least, I do know that you're a very important person to me. Mei: That's... what I wanted to tell you today. Mei: But... Mei: ...... Mei: Just now, I realized that... I really do... love you, Senpai. Mei: I mean, love is supposed to make your heart pound, isn't it? But when I'm with you, it's almost the opposite... I feel so relaxed that I thought it couldn't be love. Mei: But right now... my heart is pounding like crazy. Even though all I'm doing is telling you how I feel... my chest feels like it's about to burst. Mei: When I made up my mind to give you these chocolates... and when I decided to ask Suzune-san to teach me how to make them... Mei: While I practiced... This morning... During work... And while I was sitting here waiting for you earlier too... Mei: My heart wouldn't stop pounding. Mei: You wouldn't believe how nervous I felt. Mei: The truth is... I've had feelings for you all this time. Mei: So it's time I worked up the courage to say it. Mei: I... I think I love you, Senpai. Mei: No, wait... That doesn't sound right... Mei: ...... Mei: Senpai... I love you. Mei: I love the way you thank me, even when I've barely done anything... Mei: I love the way you're so nice to me, and lend an ear to all my worries... Mei: And I love so many other things about you too. Mei: So please... Mei: ...... Mei: Please... go out with me. Mei: Please... take me as your girlfriend. Mei: I... want to be with you from now on, Senpai. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Right now... my heart's also hammering like crazy. Kousei: When I thought you were avoiding me... it made me feel so lonely and so worried. Kousei: I was afraid you didn't like me, and I became really depressed. Kousei: Especially when you ran off without giving me any chocolate. Kousei: But then--you messaged to ask if we could meet. My heart wouldn't stop pounding on the way here. Kousei: This whole day's been a roller coaster of emotions for me. Kousei: But if what I'm feeling is the same thing you are... then I'm in love too. Kousei: In love with you, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Ah... Urk... Kousei: I love you too, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: S-So... Kousei: I want you to go out with me. Mei: ...... Mei: Ahhh... Mei: I'm a total mess of emotions right now... Kousei: Me too... My face must be burning up right now. Mei: ...... Kousei: ...... Mei: ...... Kousei: Uh... if you don't mind... Mei: Huh? Kousei: Could I call you by your first name? It'd feel oddly formal... if I kept using your last name. Mei: Y-Yeah, I agree... Go ahead. You don't have to use an honorific either... if you don't want. Kousei: Oh... Mei: Yeah. You can just call me Mei. Kousei: M... M-M-M... Mei: You're stammering so much... Kousei: I-I can't help it. I've never called you this before... Mei: That's fine. I can be patient. Kousei: M-Mei... Mei: There you go. Ehehe... Kousei: What about you? Mei: Huh? Kousei: Will you start calling me by my name? Mei: Senpai? Kousei: That's not what it says on my birth certificate. Mei: Urk... Mei: ...... Mei: Kousei... san? Kousei: You can drop the honorific too. Mei: Well... I mean, I'm younger than you, so... Mei: But maybe I could call you Kou-kun instead-- Mei: No, wait. That's even more embarrassing. Kousei: Yeah... That's pretty embarrassing for me too. Mei: Well, for now... I'm only going to use your first name when we're alone together. Kousei: A-Alright. I guess we wouldn't want the others to tease us about it. Mei: E-Exactly. Kousei: ...... Mei: ...... Kousei: Y-Yeah. I mean, if that's okay with you... Mei: O-Of course it is! Mei: ...... Mei: Finally... I'm your girlfriend! "

I shall leave that matter completely up to you. Kousei: Alright. I'll try preparing a few more dishes next week as an experiment. Maybe up the order limit to twenty-five. Kanna: Sounds good. Anyway, I'm sure you can guess why I've asked you two to stay behind. Mei: This is about my eye again, isn't it? Kanna: We just want to know how things are progressing, so this shouldn't take too much of your time. Has anything changed with your eye since we last spoke? Mei: No. I still don't know how to release my butterflies... Kanna: Not to worry. I'm certain you'll get there eventually. Mikado: Our main purpose in opening this cafe has always been to collect butterflies. Thanks to you, that task has been proceeding expeditiously. Mikado: Allow me to thank you for your hard work once again. We owe you our gratitude. Mei: A-All I'm doing is catching butterflies. I'd wouldn't exactly call that \"hard work\"... Mei: B-But either way, I'll continue to do my best to help! Mikado: Thank you. We appreciate it. Mei: ...... Mikado: But while I appreciate your efforts, I will not be transforming into a cat. Mei: Okay. I'm sorry. Kanna: Allow me to thank you as well, Takamine-san. Kousei: Huh? Why me? Kanna: While it was mere coincidence that brought you here to work with us, you've become an invaluable member of our team. Kanna: Many of our customers even come to our cafe specifically to eat your dishes now. Kanna: So thank you very much. You've been an incredible help to us all. Kousei: Well, I mean... this was all because of that \"problem\" I had with my soul in the first place... Kousei: But I'm glad you appreciate me. Honestly, this job has been pretty fulfilling for me too lately. Mikado: Indeed. It would appear your soul's condition has been greatly improving. Kanna: You can't let your guard down just yet, but as long as you keep heading in the right direction, you won't have anything to worry about. Kousei: Phew. That's a relief to hear. I owe it all to Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Huh? Kousei: Thanks for guiding me in the right direction. Mei: N-No, I didn't do anything. Kousei: You did. Thank you for everything. Mei: I-I... Mei: ...... Mei: U-Um, was there anything else you wanted to discuss? Kanna: No, I believe that's it. Mei: In that case, I've got something I need to do, so--! Mikado: Alright. Then we apologize for keeping you. Mei: That's okay! Anyway, I'll be going now! Kousei: Let me walk you-- Mei: Good night! Kousei: Huh? Kousei: Y-Yeah, I am... Kanna: Good night. Kousei: Yeah. Good night... Kousei: ...... Kousei: I should've known... Mei: Y-You're fine. Kousei: Freaking out? Mei: Y-Yeah... I... Um... Mei: ...... Mei: Oh, gosh... I'm so nervous... Mei: U-Umm... I think it would take too long to explain myself, so... h-here! Mei: Yes. It's... my Valentine's Day gift... to you. Kousei: Chocolate! Mei: Y-Yes. It's chocolate, and it's, um... handmade. Kousei: Handmade! Mei: Wow, you're really excited about this... Suzune-san taught me how to make it, so it should taste alright... I think. Kousei: Oh... Is that why you've been going home together lately? Mei: Yeah. I've been going to her apartment so she could teach me. Mei: She's also been helping me by asking you about your preferences and stuff... Kousei: My preferences? Oh, wait. Mei: Ahaha... Sorry. I guess I just felt kind of embarrassed... Kousei: Is that why the others said they weren't giving me any chocolate this year? So this would be a surprise? Mei: What? I don't know anything about that... Mei: But the others knew I was planning on giving you my own chocolate, so... I guess that could be why they did that... Kousei: Phew. I thought for sure you hated me or something... Mei: Wh-What?! Of course not! Why would you think that? Kousei: I mean, you've been avoiding me lately, haven't you? Mei: I-I wasn't... I mean... Well, maybe a little... Kousei: See? Mei: That's only because I didn't want you to find out I was preparing chocolate for you... Mei: But... I'm sorry for acting so weird. I didn't mean to give you the wrong idea. Kousei: It's alright.

What do you think? Suzune: For the last time... It doesn't LOOK delicious; it IS delicious. Mei: Well, I certainly bet it is, but since I haven't tasted it yet, I can't say for sure, can I? Mei: So having said that, let me have a teensy tiny little bite of-- Nozomi: Hands off, missy. You can have some AFTER we take some pictures. Don't forget; this is for our Instogram. Mei: Ahaha! Sorry! Kousei: Alright, let's do this. Nozomi: I guess they don't pay professional photographers for nothing. The pictures they use on restaurant menus usually look way more appetizing. Suzune: This photo, um, actually makes it looks rather UN-appetizing. Or is that just me? Kousei: No, you're definitely right. Not that I can really say anything, since I'm the one who took it. Kousei: I'll try taking a few more and see if we get a lucky shot. Mei: Wait, Senpai! I have a suggestion. Why don't we try switching locations? Kousei: What would that do? Mei: There's a special trick to taking delicious pictures of food, you see. Mei: Ah--not to say the tart doesn't look delicious as it is, of course. It most certainly does. Suzune: Good save. Mei: Phew... So, as I was saying, some girls in my class taught me this super cool trick when taking food pictures! Kousei: Okay. I'm listening. Mei: Allow me to explain! Mei: From what I'm told, you want to take pictures somewhere with a lot of light. Near a windowsill, for example. Kousei: Oh. Mei: Next, you remove any unnecessary objects. Hands, flowers, whatever--get 'em all out of the shot. Mei: The object should be photographed close up, at an angle. Also, it shouldn't necessarily be dead-center in the image, but a little off to the side. Kousei: Interesting. Nozomi: I tried asking around too, and apparently there are a ton of easy-to-use apps that allow you to enhance photos. Mei: Oh, right! My friends also recommended me some photo-editing apps we could use. Nozomi: The girls in your class are pretty knowledgeable about this stuff, huh? Mei: They all love taking selfies. Mei: Both the really girly girls like you, Nozomi-chan, and even girls that act like sleazy old men. And especially the ones addicted to Instogram. Kousei: Well, either way, I'm glad we have you, Hiuchidani-san. Kousei: Without your guidance, we'd be stuck with these crappy pictures I took. Mei: Well, don't thank me just yet... Ka-chik. Mei: How's that look? Suzune: That's amazing. Just look at how shiny the glaze is. Nozomi: Oh my gosh! Nozomi: Kousei-kun's picture actually looks kind of gross when compared to this. Kousei: I'd have to agree. Mei: I can't believe it either. This turned out way better than I thought it would. Mei: I'll send this pic to my friends and ask them what they think. Kousei: Good idea. Let us know what they say. Mei: Aye, aye. Nozomi: How many followers do we have on Instogram right now, by the way? Mei: Barely any. But, I mean, we've only posted a couple basic announcements. Kousei: Still, it's above zero, isn't it? Nozomi: Yeah. As long as we have some, then we know our flyers worked to some extent. Kousei: I wonder if there's anything we can do to get more followers? Mei: There's no special trick, really. You just gotta put in the effort. Mei: Which means posting tons of pretty pictures, and including all the right hashtags so people can find them. Kousei: Ah, okay. Kousei: So you're saying we'll naturally gain more followers if we keep posting more pics of the cakes Suzune-san bakes for us? Suzune: Don't pin this all on me. Our menu also includes pancakes, omelet rice, pasta, coffee, and tea too, in case you've forgotten. Suzune: In my opinion, we should start by photographing all the items on our menu. Mei: Oh, good idea. Let's do that first. Suzune: So make sure you cook up your best for us, okay? Kousei: I'll try. Nozomi: I know it's important to upload pictures of our food, but don't you think it'd feel a little bland if that's ALL we post? Nozomi: Maybe we could post some casual photos every now and then? Or would that be unprofessional? Kousei: I don't think it's a bad idea. Kousei: Posting a variety of pictures might help us gain more followers. As long as we do it in moderation. Mei: Oh! My friends mentioned that too. Apparently, pictures of cats get a lot of impressions. Kousei: Hmm. Mei: Yeah, I suppose we can't just pick some stray cat off the street. Oh--one of my friends responded! Mei: \"Whoa! That looks delish! I'll definitely come order that once you guys open,\" she says! Mission success! Mei: Oh, there's more! \"Try angling it to the side a bit, and zooming in a little closer.\" Nozomi: Seriously? I thought we already had it pretty close. Mei: I guess we wanna eliminate as much of the unnecessary stuff in the background as possible. Hmm. Like this, maybe? Nozomi: Nice! That's gotta be perfect. Mei: Let's do one more. Suzune: Well, I'll leave you girls to it. Once you're done, feel free to eat the tart. Mei: You don't have to tell us twice! Suzune: You're coming with me, Kousei. We're making pancakes to take pictures of next. Kousei: Yes, ma'am! "

            "Suzune: Crud. Looks like I'm all out of beer. Mei: Would you like some tea? I haven't drunk directly out of this one yet. Suzune: Sure. By the way, these kelp rolls are delicious. Mei: Hehe. I'll be sure to let my grandma know. Have as many as you want! Suzune: Hey, Kousei! Is it ready yet? I'm already getting full from all these kelp rolls! Kousei: Sorry for the wait. I just finished now. Mei: But you added some kind of smoked ingredient, didn't you? Kousei: You'll see. Go ahead and try it. Suzune: Uh-huh. Mei: ...... Suzune: ...... Mei: Oh? Suzune: Something tastes different. It's a lot more fragrant when I bite into it. Mei: It can't be the bacon, right? Where's this smoky flavor coming from? Suzune: It doesn't seem to be the vegetables, either... What exactly did you do? Kousei: It's the black pepper. That's what I smoked. Mei: Ohh! It's the seasoning! Kousei: Yeah. In a way, black pepper is actually the main ingredient in carbonara. That's where the name of the dish comes from, in fact. Suzune: It's derived from the Italian word for charcoal burner, right? Because there's supposed to be so much pepper on it that it turns black. Kousei: Exactly. I was contemplating whether or not to smoke the salt, but I thought that would change the flavor too much. Kousei: So I decided to smoke the pepper instead. This way it adds a nice kick without destroying the balance of the dish. Suzune: You're right. It really does add a nice kick. It's amazing how a small addition can make such a big difference. Suzune: Even though the seasoning is fundamentally the same, the flavor has a lot more depth. Mei: This is amazing! Just like authentic carbonara! Not that I know what authentic carbonara tastes like, but still! Kousei: Glad you like it. I only just finished smoking the pepper, so the smell might be a little harsh-- Kousei: But as long as I let it sit for a while, it should disappear. Then all I need to do is mix it with some regular black pepper to fine tune the flavor. Suzune: Sounds good. It could use a bit of adjusting, but I definitely think this is good enough to serve to our customers. In all honesty, this really is delicious. Kousei: Thanks. What about you-- Mei: Phew! That was good! Kousei: Wow. Not even a crumb left. Mei: It was too good! Just like real Italian cuisine! Not that I know what real Italian cuisine tastes like, but still! Suzune: You already said that earlier. I get what you're trying to say, though. Kousei: Ahaha... I wasn't expecting this much of a reaction. I'm flattered. Mei: Seriously, it was delicious! You're a genius, Senpai! Kousei: O-Oh stop it... Suzune: Well, since Mei-san is showering you in praise, I'm going to be a little more critical. Suzune: Like you said before, the dish still needs some balancing. Kousei: I know. It's got a pretty strong flavor, so I'm gonna try letting it mellow overnight next time. Suzune: Instead of trying to figure out everything on your own, though, you should ask the others at the cafe to taste-test your dish first. Suzune: Then you can decide if you want to tone it down, or if you actually want to emphasize that distinct flavor. Mei: Ohh, I see! The more unique it tastes, the more likely it is to grab people's interest! Suzune: Exactly. But you might get differing opinions on which one is better, which'll make it harder to decide. Suzune: Still, it's up to you. At the very least, I don't think anyone's going to object to you adding this dish to our menu. Kousei: Alright. I'll give it a shot. Kousei: And thanks, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Huh? Kousei: I wouldn't have come up with this idea without you, so thanks. Mei: Please! All I did was suggest the first thing that came to mind. Mei: Don't underestimate your own genius, Senpai! This really is amazing! Kousei: Th-Thanks. Suzune: Ahem. Kousei: Wh-What? Suzune: We're all out of cheese and sausages, so I'm gonna need you to make me some more. Kousei: You already ate them all? I wanted some too, you know. Suzune: Oh, stop griping. C'mon! Kousei: Alright, alright. Fine. Mei: Senpai! I want to try smoking some other things too! Kousei: Sure. I'll rummage around my fridge and see what else we can toss in the smoker. Mei: This is gonna be great! Kanna: Here's to another great year! Let's all do our best! Suzune: Alrighty. Ready to get back to work? Kousei: Yes, ma'am. Kousei: Not so much changed as added a new twist. I tried smoking the pepper first. Natsume: I can't say it looks or smells particularly different, though... Kousei: You'll see once you try it. Nozomi: Well, I'm gonna go ahead and dig in! Nozomi: That faint hint of smokiness... It's amazing how much difference it makes. Natsume: You said you smoked it yourself? Kousei: Yep. It was all Hiuchidani-san's idea. Mei: Don't be silly. You came up with the idea to smoke the black pepper. Mei: All I did was suggest that we try to make our own bacon. Natsume: Ah. So you spent the break thinking up ways to improve our menu... Natsume: That's very commendable of you. I'm impressed. Kousei: Thanks. How do you think it tastes? Kanna: I, for one, think it's delicious. It gives the dish a lot more added depth. Nozomi: I think so too. This seems like it'd be a real crowd-pleaser. Natsume: It certainly is delicious, but... Kousei: But? Natsume: I feel like the pepper's unique smokiness has a sort of... mature taste to it. Natsume: It's definitely not bad by any means, but--and this is just my personal opinion... Natsume: But I think I actually prefer the regular carbonara. Natsume: So while I'm all for adding this to our menu, I don't think it should replace the original version. Nozomi: You said you added the smoked black pepper to the pasta at the end, right? Kousei: Yeah, I did. Nozomi: In that case, why don't we just serve our regular carbonara with a shaker of smoked black pepper on the side? Nozomi: That way, customers can add as much or as little as they want. Natsume: How would we know how much to prepare in advance, though? Some customers might use a lot more than others. Suzune: A lot of beef bowl restaurants used to do the same thing with their special shichimi spices, but they had to stop the practice a little while back. Suzune: Some customers were using unbelievable amounts of spice, which ended up hurting their profits. Nozomi: Oh... I guess that won't work then. Kanna: It seems like our safest option would be to add this smoked pepper version as a separate item on the menu. Kousei: Alright. So I have all the judges' approval? Kanna: Absolutely. I think this would make a fine addition to our menu. Nozomi: Me too. Natsume: Me three. Kanna: What do you think, Mikado-san? Mikado: I believe Natsume mentioned earlier that this dish had a rather mature taste. However, many of our customers also come here specifically for our coffee and tea. Mikado: Judging from what I have gathered, this would suit their preferences well. Mikado: Therefore, I am in agreement. Kousei: Thank goodness... Mei: Way to go, Senpai! Kousei: Thanks! Kousei: I was just gonna do it at home, actually... Mikado: Among other problems, that would be quite expensive. I would not recommend you do that. Kousei: I guess that's true. Mikado: I do have some other ideas you may wish to consider. Are you free to talk after this? Kousei: Sure. I've got time. Kanna: In that case, let's call it a day here. See you tomorrow, everyone. Natsume: See you tomorrow. Nozomi: See you tomorrow! Kousei: Phew... Kousei: Huh? Hiuchidani-san? Mei: Hey. Kousei: What are you still doing here? Mei: I was waiting for you to finish. Kousei: You could've waited inside. Mei: Ahaha. I didn't want to bother you guys. Mei: Anyway, I know I should've said something earlier... but would you mind walking me home? Kousei: Sure. I don't mind. Let's go. Mei: Thanks! Mei: Congratulations on getting your new recipe approved, by the way. Kousei: Well, you helped with that. Mei: Not at all. You did this on your own, Senpai. Kousei: Nah, it's all thanks to you. I would've never come up with this idea on my own. Kousei: Seriously, thank you. I'm really grateful. Kousei: This might sound kind of melodramatic... but I think I've gained a little more confidence in myself now. Mei: Ehehe... You're gonna make me blush. I don't mean to sound melodramatic either, but, like... Mei: You've done a lot for me as well, Senpai. Ever since you've helped me open up about my left eye, I feel like a huge weight's been lifted off my shoulders. Mei: That's why I wanted to be able to return the favor if I could. Mei: I'm glad I managed to be of some small help to you. Kousei: It wasn't small at all. You were a big help. Kousei: I was hoping to do something like this before I had to deal with my exams, so I'm glad it all went so well. Mei: Oh, your exams are coming up? Kousei: At the end of the month, yeah. Mei: Does that mean you're gonna be working fewer hours? Kousei: No, I'll be working the same as usual. I'll do fine as long as I pay attention in class. Kousei: And I can always study after work too. Mei: You're a pretty diligent student, aren't you? Kousei: I don't know about that... I'm just the sort of guy who hates procrastinating. Mei: That's what it means to be diligent, Senpai. I think that's something to be proud of. Kousei: Nah, trust me... I can be pretty lazy when I want. Mei: But in front of me, at least, you're always hardworking and dependable. Kousei: Okay, sheesh. Stop flattering me. It's gonna go to my head. Mei: Ahaha! Alright. Mei: Well, good night, Senpai. Kousei: Good night. And sorry you had to wait for me earlier. Mei: That's okay. I waited because I wanted to congratulate you. Mei: Anyway, see you tomorrow! Kousei: Yeah. See you tomorrow. Mei: ...... Mei: Hmm... Exams... ",
            "Mei: Phew. I thought I was running late, but it looks like you arrived at the same time as me. Kousei: Yeah, I just got out of class. Kousei: Shiki-san and Nozomi should already be here, so let's head inside. Mei: Okay. Mei: Good morning! Kanna: Welcome, you two. Mei: It's a little weird being greeted with a \"Welcome\" when the cafe's closed. Kanna: Then by that logic, saying \"Good morning\" is weird too, no? We're not working. Mei: I guess that's true. Kanna: You're here to study for your exams, right? Natsume-san and Nozomi-san are already here. Kousei: Yeah, sorry. Nozomi: It's fine. You two were in class. Natsume: You don't have to apologize. It's no big deal to us. Kanna: What would everyone like to drink? I'll prepare some refreshments. Nozomi: Huh? But... Kanna: It's no trouble at all. If it'll help you focus on your studies, I'd be happy to help. Nozomi: That's really nice of you. In that case, I'll have a cup of Earl Grey. Mei: Can I get a glass of orange juice? Kanna: Sure. Kanna: What about you two? Natsume: I'll have an Earl Grey too. Kousei: I'll have a coffee. Kanna: Alright. Kousei: Let's get to it then. Did you manage to find the stuff I asked for? Natsume: Here. These were the only ones I had left. Kousei: Thanks. These should help. Natsume: We might be in different majors, but you managed to get into Hitotsuboshi too, so you had to have gotten high grades yourself. Kousei: Well, I had a lot of help, as I'm sure you can imagine. Plus, my grades were only just barely good enough to be accepted. Nozomi: Urgh. These tests are crazy. I can't even figure out this last question with the answer in front of me. Mei: I'm getting a headache just looking at it. Kousei: Yeah, there are quite a few nasty questions in here. Natsume: You can thank my teacher, Saeki-sensei, for that. Apparently, he was a huge math buff. Natsume: Rumor had it he made these questions specifically to be solved using applied mathematics, just to show students the beauty of mathmatics. Nozomi: I'm going to go out on a limb and say he didn't succeed. Natsume: Yeah, most of us couldn't stand his class. Not that we hated him, per se; he was a fine person, just his tests were awful. Mei: That's what I hear too. Kousei: This teacher still teaches there? Mei: Yeah, he sure does. Kousei: Well, these tests should be great reference material then. Kousei: As for the English ones, all these questions seem pretty standard. Natsume: At least when I was there, the only subject that had insanely difficult questions was math. Kousei: Good. Then as long as we use these tests and the textbook to review, you should be able to avoid failing. Natsume: Sounds like a lot of rote memorization, though. Kousei: It'll have to do, for now. There's not enough time for her to re-learn all the material. Mei: Thank you very much. Nozomi: At the moment, I guess I'm struggling with Natsume-san's math questions the most. Nozomi: An in-depth explanation would really help. Natsume: Alright. I'll walk you both through it, so listen up. Nozomi: Okay! Mei: I'm all ears. Mei: Thank you! Nozomi: Sorry for the trouble. And thanks. Natsume: Thank you for doing this, Akizuki-san. Natsume: So anyway--if I apply this formula here, using the value I calculated above, that should give me the answer. Does that make sense? Nozomi: Ahh, I see. Now that you explain it like that, I sort of understand... Maybe... Maybe not? Mei: You're amazing, Nozomi-chan. I still don't get it at all! Natsume: Well, that's no surprise. You're learning from scratch. Natsume: I'll try to explain it as simply as I can, okay? But let me know right away if there's something you don't understand. Mei: Okaaay... *sigh*... Kousei: You're sighing way too much. Natsume: If you're not having any trouble with what I just explained, Sumizome-san, you can go ahead and start studying something else. Nozomi: Well, I wouldn't say I fully understand it yet. Nozomi: Alright, though. Can I borrow your English test? I want to use it to study. Natsume: Be my guest. Mei: Sorry I'm delaying us, Nozomi-san. Nozomi: Hey, it's not a big deal. Nozomi: The whole reason we're having this study session is to learn! Nozomi: So let's work hard and do our best to pass, okay? Mei: Yeah! Kanna: And here's your coffee, Takamine-san. Kousei: Oh, thanks. Kanna: By the way, what are you doing? Kousei: I'm putting together a list of stuff I want to cover. Kanna: Oh, okay. Preparing your teaching materials. Would you like me to help? Kousei: You'd be willing? Kanna: Don't worry. I can at least help you organize everything. Kanna: Everyone's studying their hardest. I want to chip in to help too. Kousei: Alright. Grab a seat. Kanna: Thank you. Nozomi: Kousei-kun, can I ask you something? Kousei: What's up? Nozomi: How come the answer to this one is number two? The other choices sound like they make sense too. Kousei: Hm? Let me see. Ah. Well, if you look at the paragraph before the blank, you can tell whether it's a factual or hypothetical statement. Kousei: The question is asking about something that happened in the past, so the answer has to be number two. Number one is a conjunction, so that wouldn't make sense. See? There's a comma here. Nozomi: Oh, you're right! Urk... Why didn't I catch that? Kousei: It's an easy mistake to make. This whole section can be a little tricky. Kousei: But it's something you need to know. You'll find these sorts of questions on the English proficiency test as well. Nozomi: Really? Alright, thanks. I'd better study it some more then. Kanna: You're actually quite smart, aren't you, Takamine-san? Nozomi: You wouldn't think it, would you? We've known each other for ages, and he always helps me study for tests, but even I still can't believe it sometimes. Nozomi: I never see him cramming at home, so I have no idea how his grades are so good. Kousei: Hey, I put in the effort just like everybody else. Kanna: Is that true? Kousei: The most efficient way to retain information is to pay attention in class. That, and taking notes. Kousei: If I do that, a single glance is all it takes to remember what I learned, which also helps me cut down on review time. Kanna: More haste, less speed, as they say. Nozomi: He's been saying that stuff for years. But if it was that easy to pay attention in class, we wouldn't be asking for help in the first place. Nozomi: Ugh, I can't do this. My concentration is shot. Mei: Me too. It feels like my brain is about to burn out... *sputter* *sputter*... Natsume: Oh, it's getting quite late. Alright. Let's call it a day. Mei: *siiigh* Thank you very much... Nozomi: Thank you! Natsume: You're welcome. So what do you think? Feeling a little more confident now? Mei: Uhh, yeah. I think I understand a bit more now... sort of. Natsume: Ah. Well, I'm glad my explanations made sense to you. Mei: I'll try reviewing everything again once I get home. Natsume: If there's anything you don't understand, let me know. Natsume: Even if it's something we've gone over already, don't be embarrassed. It happens sometimes. Mei: Okay. Thank you for your help. Kousei: Why don't we get you to take the same tests Shiki-san lent us tomorrow? Kousei: After you review the questions you get wrong, you can retake them again the next day. Natsume: I think that's a good idea too. Mei: But, like, won't I just be solving the same questions over and over? Natsume: There's nothing wrong with that. The worst thing would be for you to only think you understand. Kousei: Yeah, the goal here is to make sure you comprehend what you're learning. Kousei: If you can get the same grades Shiki-san did, you should be able to pass your exams without a hitch. But simply memorizing her answers won't mean anything. Mei: Yes, I know. Kousei: Are you okay with that too, Nozomi? Nozomi: Sounds good to me. Natsume: Starting tomorrow, I want you to come in to the cafe even on your days off. Kousei: We'll be able to help you study if you use the break room. Though it'll have to be while we're on the job. Mei: Alright. Thank you kindly. Kanna: Also, take these. I made copies of all your English and Japanese history study materials. Nozomi: Thank you so much! Kousei: Japanese history will largely be pure memorization, but for English, make sure you think about your answers carefully and review them. Mei: I will. Kousei: And thanks for helping out too, Akizuki-san. Kanna: Not at all. Helping people in need is also a part of my job now. Mei: Thanks for everything today. Natsume: Don't thank us just yet. Thank us once you've passed your exams. Mei: True. Alright then! I'll do my best! Nozomi: I'm hooome. Rokurou: Welcome back, Nozomi. Rokurou: Pretty late today, aren't you? I thought you didn't have work on Wednesdays. Nozomi: I was studying with a friend today. Kousei-kun and one of my coworkers were helping us prepare for our mid-terms. Nozomi: I wasn't playing around, so relax. Rokurou: That's not really what I'm worried about... Rokurou: I'm glad to see you working so hard, but make sure you don't overdo it. Rokurou: You've been staying up rather late these days, haven't you? Pulling all-nighters isn't good for your health. Nozomi: I know, geez. That's why I'm doing this now, so I don't have to stay up all night. Nozomi: Anyway, I'm going back to my room to do a bit more review. Rokurou: Don't you want to take a bath? Nozomi: Later. Nozomi: ...... Nozomi: ...... Nozomi: ... Nozomi: Nh... Ngh! Ahh, it's already this late? Nozomi: *sigh*... I studied a whole, whole lot. I've never been able to do this much on my own before. Nozomi: I'd better go take a bath now. If I don't get some sleep soon, I won't be able to wake up on time tomorrow. ",
            "Mei: Ah, Senpai! Kousei: Hey. You know, I just realized something after seeing your outfit. Mei: What's that? Kousei: You're on winter break. Mei: Ahaha! Seriously? Why do you think we're meeting up this early in the day? Kousei: True. For some reason, I guess I assumed you'd want to put all this off until after the holidays. Mei: I don't want school getting in the way. Plus, Suzune-san says we're going to be ridiculously busy on Christmas. Kousei: You're working on Christmas? Mei: Yep. I specifically asked to. Kousei: You aren't doing anything with your friends? Mei: Ahaha... Well, they've all got boyfriends, so... Kousei: Ah. Not too surprising then. Mei: You're working Christmas too, aren't you? And Christmas Eve as well, if I recall. Kousei: Yeah. I don't have any plans either, so I figured I might as well. Mei: Sad being single, isn't it? Kousei: Yeah... Mei: Well, not exactly. I recognize her, but I doubt she recognizes me. Mei: Yep. I thought I recognized her from somewhere, so I came here yesterday to double-check. And I was right. Kousei: Didn't take us long to find her, did it? Come to think of it, this is where you and I found out about Yuina's dad too. Mei: Hey, you're right! Maybe this is a lucky place. Kousei: Maybe. Or maybe it's you. Mei: Huh? Me? Kousei: It almost feels like you have a knack for running into people with butterflies or something. Mei: I'm not really sure how to feel about that. Kousei: Sorry. Just a thought. Kousei: Me neither. Mei: Weird. Maybe she isn't the same person? Kousei: Or maybe she already solved her own issues before we could intervene? Mei: I wonder... Hm? Wait, wh-what? Kousei: I see it. Mei: I've never seen anyone's wisps appear and disappear like that. Kousei: What do you mean? Mei: Ah. The guy's back. Kousei: ...... Mei: ...... Kousei: The butterfly's flying away. Mei: You're right. I... can't see the wisp anymore. Kousei: Hmm... Mei: Maybe that man has powers too. Powers like mine. Kousei: The power to repel butterflies, instead of attracting them? It's possible, I guess... Mei: Ah. We probably look really suspicious right now, don't we? Kousei: Huh? Oh, right. Why don't we go over there? Kousei: Hmm. Let's try giving Akizuki-san a call first. Kousei: This could be an unusual case, so we don't want to act rashly. Mei: Okay. Good point! Kanna: Hello? Kousei: This is Takamine. Kanna: Do you need something? Kanna: You said the butterfly disappears whenever this coworker of hers is nearby, correct? Kousei: Yeah. And whenever he leaves, the butterfly comes back. Kousei: Hiuchidani-san thought that maybe the man had some kind of power to repel butterflies... Kanna: *sigh* I didn't think you two were THIS obtuse... Kousei: Come again? Kanna: She's obviously lovestruck. Kousei: What? Sh-She's in love? Kanna: She is. If I had to guess, I'd say that this woman is secretly in love with her coworker. Kousei: She has a crush on him? Wait, really? That's why she's attracting butterflies? Kanna: Hey, don't be so dismissive of the power of love. Kanna: It has the power to incite our deepest, darkest passions. Love inflames the soul, for better or for worse. Kanna: And I would daresay that love is what's thrown that woman's emotions into turmoil. Kanna: She feels happy when they're together, but depressed when they're apart. Kanna: That would explain why the butterfly comes and goes like that. Kousei: I... guess? Kanna: She's probably agonizing over whether or not to confess her feelings to him. Kanna: But if she continues to remain under the butterfly's influence, she may lose hope and decide to give up on him altogether. Kousei: So we should use Hiuchidani-san's powers to capture her butterfly to prevent that from happening? Kanna: To be honest, I'm not entirely sure. If she ends up being rejected anyway, she may become even MORE susceptible to the butterfly's influence. Kanna: I'll leave it up to you to decide what to do, though. And again, please try not to draw unnecessary attention to yourselves. Kousei: I know. Thanks for the help, Akizuki-san. Kousei: Yeah. Apparently, the woman's in love with her coworker, and that's why her emotions are so unstable. Mei: Ohh... Sh-She's in love... That was why! Mei: Th-This feels, like, really embarrassing to say, even though she's a complete stranger... Kousei: It's almost Christmas too. She might be thinking about confessing to him tomorrow or the day after. Mei: Wh-What? Mei: Ngh... Ahh! Kousei: Y-You okay? Mei: I-I'm sorry. I'm just, um, not really used to talking about these sorts of things... Mei: It's getting me a little too worked up... Kousei: Want me to go get you something to drink? Mei: N-No, I'm fine... Kousei: Right. Whenever she's together with him, her spirits temporarily lift, which is why the wisp disappears. Kousei: But when they're apart, she goes back to feeling anxious, which is when the wisp returns. Kousei: Or at least, that's what Akizuki-san's theory is. Mei: Hrmm... Mei: ...... Mei: What if... Kousei: Hm? Mei: What if we do nothing and just let things run their course? Mei: Her wisp already goes away on its own from time to time without me having to make it disappear. Mei: I'm not sure I should be interfering... Kousei: Well... I suppose Akizuki-san DID say the situation wasn't urgent. Kousei: Trust me, you'd know if it was. There'd be a lot more butterflies. Kousei: That woman only has one or two around her at most, so she isn't terribly affected by them. At least, for now. Kousei: Even if we do nothing, it's possible that she'll overcome their influence on her own and confess her feelings. Kousei: But that said, we could still be way off mark. It may have nothing to do with love. Mei: Oh, true... There could be something else that's troubling her. Kousei: From Mikado's point of view, her personal problems aren't really our concern. The important thing is that we catch the butterfly. Mei: Yeah. That's their job, after all. Mei: Then I guess this was our only choice from the start... Mei: It's done. Kousei: Wow. Mei: Huh? Kousei: That was incredible. Beautiful, even. Mei: W-Was it? I can't really tell, myself... Kousei: It definitely looks like she has. Mei: I hope it goes well... Kousei: That's up to her. All we can do is pray that it does. Mei: Yeah. Kousei: If she gets rejected, though... Mei: Hey, don't say that, Senpai. You're gonna jinx it! Kousei: M-My bad. Kousei: Anyway, we've done all we can. The rest is out of our hands. Mei: Alrighty. Mission complete! Kousei: Yep. Not that I actually did anything. Mei: Ahaha! You phoned for help. That counts plenty, I think. Kousei: It'd feel weird to just go home now... Why don't we grab a drink or something? Mei: Good idea! I also want to see if anything happens between those two. Kousei: In that case, how about we get-- Mei: Let's get smoothies! Kousei: Thought you'd say that. Mei: Thanks for paying for me again. Kousei: No problem. It can be your reward for catching the butterfly. Mei: Hehe. You're the best. Mei: By the way, I heard that we're going to be helping bake cakes tomorrow. Kousei: Oh, right. Apparently we received a lot more orders than we expected, so we need all hands on deck. Kousei: Suzune-san wants everyone to pitch in and help. Mei: My shift doesn't start till the afternoon, though. Will I even make it in time to help? Kousei: Suzune-san says we'll be baking them so they're ready just in time for customers to pick up. Kousei: So don't worry. There's gonna be plenty of work to go around. Mei: Alrighty! I don't know if I'll be any good at baking, though... Kousei: You'll probably be put in charge of sales. Mei: Oh, right. I guess we can't have everyone making cakes. Mei: Sounds like it's gonna be a pretty tough day tomorrow. Let's get through this together! Kousei: It'll definitely be busy, but at least we'll get to spend the holidays together with everyone at the cafe. Mei: Ahaha! True that. Mei: Oh, Senpai! Look! Kousei: And it must've gone well. Mei: Yeah! I'm so happy for her. Mei: A Christmas date with her crush... How nice. Kousei: Too bad the only date we have is our jobs. Mei: Urk... Talk about depressing... Kousei: Well, you ready to get going? Mei: Sure. Kousei: We can tell Akizuki-san what happened tomorrow. It's gonna be a busy day, so we should get home early and rest up. Mei: Oh, well I wouldn't mind going to tell her right now, actually! Kousei: You just want to play with Mikado some more, don't you? Mei: Urk... How'd you know? Kousei: It was written all over your face. Mei: Ngh... Can you blame me?! His amazing fluffiness is enough to make anyone go crazy! Mei: Ah. I can be a little too candid sometimes, can't I? I'm sorry. I'll try to be more careful. Kousei: Eh, I don't mind. Feel free to be yourself. I'd prefer that, actually. Mei: Really? Well, please forgive me if I start acting too friendly. Ehehe. Mei: Welp, let's go on home! Kousei: Sounds like a plan. Mei: Let's work real hard tomorrow! Kousei: O-Okay... Kanna: Yes... Nozomi: I-I'll try to hang in there... Kanna: Still, it's not all bad. We wouldn't have gotten such a flood of orders if people didn't love your cakes. Nozomi: Even at my school, there are a ton of kids who are fans of your baking. Suzune: Well, I am a professional. Can't go losing to other restaurants in terms of quality. Suzune: Though... I do apologize for biting off more than I could chew. I knew I should've put a limit on the number of orders. Kousei: But it wasn't an impossible amount. We're nearly there. Kanna: Yeah. Let's hang in there just a little bit longer! Nozomi: Okay! Suzune: You can say that again. I'm exhausted... Natsume: I thought selling cakes would be easier than baking them... Boy, was I wrong. Kousei: I never stepped out of the kitchen today, but there must've been a crazy number of customers. Mei: You wouldn't believe it. We somehow managed to pull through with the three of us, but we could barely keep up. Natsume: Even without counting the people who were here to pick up advance orders, there were a ton of customers who came to buy our regular cakes too... Mei: But even those were flying off the shelves. Natsume: Yeah. I know you guys tried to restock them as fast as you could, but even then they would sell out almost instantly. Suzune: That's probably what I regret the most. Shouldn't have prioritized the advance orders so much. Mikado: Now I understand where the phrase \"selling like hotcakes\" comes from. It's incredible the effect the Christmas holidays have on sales. Kousei: Coming from someone on the kitchen side, you don't know the half of it. Suzune: I mean, they say sales typically go up tenfold on Christmas Eve. Cake stores everywhere are working overtime. Nozomi: Even though Christmas itself is tomorrow, it almost feels like we had more advance orders for today. Suzune: Yep. Christmas Eve is usually the peak in terms of sales. But make no mistake, we'll still be plenty busy tomorrow as well. Natsume: It's an excellent business opportunity, for sure. That said, I'm kind of worried that we're working you too hard, Suzune-san. Suzune: I could say the same for the rest of you. We've gotta strike while the iron's hot, though, so let's keep it up for one more day. Kanna: Agreed. Let's all get a good night's rest so we can be ready for tomorrow. Natsume: See you tomorrow, everyone. Mei & Nozomi: See you all tomorrow! Mei: Y-Yes. Mikado: Mei. Mei: Yes? Mikado: Why are you staring at me with those bloodshot eyes? Mei: I was, um... wondering if you could transform back into your-- Mikado: No. Mei: ...... Kanna: I've never seen anyone's spirits drop that fast. Mikado: Good grief. I am not your pet cat. Mei: You're right. I'm sorry... Mikado: So, what happened after you captured the butterfly? Kousei: She seemed to brighten up considerably. Kousei: And I'm positive that change was due to the influence of Hiuchidani-san's power. Kousei: But assuming we were right about her being lovestruck, she'll most likely become depressed again if she's dumped, so we may have to monitor her situation again if that happens. Kanna: You're sure she didn't notice you two at all? Mei: No. We never got close to her, so I don't think she could've noticed us. Mikado: Even if she had noticed you, I doubt the woman would have linked you to the improvement in her mood. Mikado: The important thing is that you managed to capture the butterfly. Now all that's left is for Mei to learn how to release it. Mei: I'll try my best! Kanna: Just remember to practice only when we're around, and not on your own. Kanna: If you were to accidentally release your butterflies by mistake, there's no telling what effect it could have on the people around you. Mei: Got it! Mikado: You've done well. Make sure you get plenty of rest tonight. Mei: I will! Thank you! Kanna: Have a good night, you two. Kousei: Good night. Mei: Hey, Senpai! You wanna stop by someplace with me? Kousei: I was about to suggest the same thing. You want to go see how that woman's doing, right? Mei: Ahaha. I'm just curious. Mei: I have the feeling she won't be at the store, but it wouldn't hurt to take a look. Kousei: Yeah. Mei: Alright! Let's go. Mei: Hmm... Looks like I was right. Kousei: Guess she isn't here. Mei: She's probably out somewhere with her crush right now. Kousei: Maybe. Probably not here at the mall, though. Mei: Ahaha. Yeah. Who would want to go on a date where they work? Mei: But even if they were here, we wouldn't be able to spot them with how many people there are. Kousei: True. Nothing but Christmas couples as far as the eye can see. Mei: ...... Kousei: Hm? Mei: N-Nothing. It's just... you're a guy and I'm a girl, so... Mei: Other people might think we're a couple too, and that's a little embarrassing... Kousei: You don't want to be seen with me? Ouch... Mei: N-No, that's not what I meant! Kousei: I'm kidding, I'm kidding. You really aren't good with romance and stuff, are you? Mei: I-I'm just not used to it, I guess... Mei: ...... Mei: Say, Senpai... What do you think of me? Kousei: Huh? Wh-Wh-What do you mean? Mei: W-Wait, that came out wrong! I don't mean it like THAT! Mei: I mean, what do you think of me as a person? What kind of impression do you have of me? Kousei: O-Oh, uh, let me think... Mei: Do you think I'm rude, or difficult to approach? Kousei: Oh, no. I've never thought of you as that. Mei: Really? Kousei: Really. If anything, you're the opposite. I've always thought you were very cheery and easy to talk to. Mei: Ah... Thank goodness. I guess I'm doing a good job then... Kousei: What do you mean? Mei: ...... Mei: This might be a little off topic, but... Kousei: I'm listening. Mei: I once told my mom and dad about my eye too. Mei: But they seemed to think I was joking, so they just laughed it off. Mei: Even when I started growing out my bangs, they thought I was just going through my... what'cha call it... my edgy phase? Mei: That's when I realized I wasn't normal, and they didn't understand me. Mei: Ever since then, I stopped talking to people. Mei: It might be a bit dramatic to say I was traumatized by the experience... Mei: But in a way, I sort of was. It's always there, in the back of my mind. Mei: The frustration of not being understood. Mei: The burden of having to hide who I really am. Mei: I know I'm not normal. The truth is, I'm constantly afraid that I'll never fit in with those around me. Kousei: What do you mean? If anything, you're always the center of attention. Kousei: Out of all of us, you're undoubtedly the best at handling customers. Everyone at the cafe relies on you. Mei: Ahaha. Thank you. I appreciate it. Mei: You know, I wish I could work at the cafe forever. Mei: It makes me incredibly happy to know that I finally met other people who completely understand me. Mei: I've never cared much about the Christmas holidays, honestly... Mei: I might not have a boyfriend to spend it with, but at least I got to spend it with people who understand me. Mei: So thank you, Senpai. Mei: Thank you for paying attention to me. Kousei: I'm, er... glad I could help you be yourself. Mei: Absolutely! Kousei: Don't sweat it. I've got a bit of an unusual situation of my own, actually. Kousei: I understand how it feels, not being normal. Mei: You do? Kousei: There's a bit of a problem with my soul, you see. And I'm looking for a way to fix it. Mei: Is there anything I can do to help? Kousei: Well... Mei: Oh. Well, let me know if there's ever anything I can do to help! Kousei: I will. Thanks. Mei: Hey, I've got an idea! Like, this is way off topic, but just hear me out. Kousei: Hm? Mei: Let's go get another smoothie! Kousei: Sure. Guess that's sort of our tradition now, every time we come here. Mei: Ahaha! I guess so! But let me pay for you this time! Kousei: Nah, you don't have to. Mei: Nuh-uh, I am. I still haven't paid you back for helping me study for my mid-terms. Kousei: Seeing your grades go up was reward enough for me. Mei: Nice try, but I'm paying for you, whether you like it or not! Mei: Now come on, let's go! Kousei: Alright, alright. "

Looks like I'm all out of beer. Mei: Would you like some tea? I haven't drunk directly out of this one yet. Suzune: Sure. By the way, these kelp rolls are delicious. Mei: Hehe. I'll be sure to let my grandma know. Have as many as you want! Suzune: Hey, Kousei! Is it ready yet? I'm already getting full from all these kelp rolls! Kousei: Sorry for the wait. I just finished now. Mei: But you added some kind of smoked ingredient, didn't you? Kousei: You'll see. Go ahead and try it. Suzune: Uh-huh. Mei: ...... Suzune: ...... Mei: Oh? Suzune: Something tastes different. It's a lot more fragrant when I bite into it. Mei: It can't be the bacon, right? Where's this smoky flavor coming from? Suzune: It doesn't seem to be the vegetables, either... What exactly did you do? Kousei: It's the black pepper. That's what I smoked. Mei: Ohh! It's the seasoning! Kousei: Yeah. In a way, black pepper is actually the main ingredient in carbonara. That's where the name of the dish comes from, in fact. Suzune: It's derived from the Italian word for charcoal burner, right? Because there's supposed to be so much pepper on it that it turns black. Kousei: Exactly. I was contemplating whether or not to smoke the salt, but I thought that would change the flavor too much. Kousei: So I decided to smoke the pepper instead. This way it adds a nice kick without destroying the balance of the dish. Suzune: You're right. It really does add a nice kick. It's amazing how a small addition can make such a big difference. Suzune: Even though the seasoning is fundamentally the same, the flavor has a lot more depth. Mei: This is amazing! Just like authentic carbonara! Not that I know what authentic carbonara tastes like, but still! Kousei: Glad you like it. I only just finished smoking the pepper, so the smell might be a little harsh-- Kousei: But as long as I let it sit for a while, it should disappear. Then all I need to do is mix it with some regular black pepper to fine tune the flavor. Suzune: Sounds good. It could use a bit of adjusting, but I definitely think this is good enough to serve to our customers. In all honesty, this really is delicious. Kousei: Thanks. What about you-- Mei: Phew! That was good! Kousei: Wow. Not even a crumb left. Mei: It was too good! Just like real Italian cuisine! Not that I know what real Italian cuisine tastes like, but still! Suzune: You already said that earlier. I get what you're trying to say, though. Kousei: Ahaha... I wasn't expecting this much of a reaction. I'm flattered. Mei: Seriously, it was delicious! You're a genius, Senpai! Kousei: O-Oh stop it... Suzune: Well, since Mei-san is showering you in praise, I'm going to be a little more critical. Suzune: Like you said before, the dish still needs some balancing. Kousei: I know. It's got a pretty strong flavor, so I'm gonna try letting it mellow overnight next time. Suzune: Instead of trying to figure out everything on your own, though, you should ask the others at the cafe to taste-test your dish first. Suzune: Then you can decide if you want to tone it down, or if you actually want to emphasize that distinct flavor. Mei: Ohh, I see! The more unique it tastes, the more likely it is to grab people's interest! Suzune: Exactly. But you might get differing opinions on which one is better, which'll make it harder to decide. Suzune: Still, it's up to you. At the very least, I don't think anyone's going to object to you adding this dish to our menu. Kousei: Alright. I'll give it a shot. Kousei: And thanks, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Huh? Kousei: I wouldn't have come up with this idea without you, so thanks. Mei: Please! All I did was suggest the first thing that came to mind. Mei: Don't underestimate your own genius, Senpai! This really is amazing! Kousei: Th-Thanks. Suzune: Ahem. Kousei: Wh-What? Suzune: We're all out of cheese and sausages, so I'm gonna need you to make me some more. Kousei: You already ate them all? I wanted some too, you know. Suzune: Oh, stop griping. C'mon! Kousei: Alright, alright. Fine. Mei: Senpai! I want to try smoking some other things too! Kousei: Sure. I'll rummage around my fridge and see what else we can toss in the smoker. Mei: This is gonna be great! Kanna: Here's to another great year! Let's all do our best! Suzune: Alrighty. Ready to get back to work? Kousei: Yes, ma'am. Kousei: Not so much changed as added a new twist. I tried smoking the pepper first. Natsume: I can't say it looks or smells particularly different, though... Kousei: You'll see once you try it. Nozomi: Well, I'm gonna go ahead and dig in! Nozomi: That faint hint of smokiness... It's amazing how much difference it makes. Natsume: You said you smoked it yourself? Kousei: Yep. It was all Hiuchidani-san's idea. Mei: Don't be silly. You came up with the idea to smoke the black pepper. Mei: All I did was suggest that we try to make our own bacon. Natsume: Ah. So you spent the break thinking up ways to improve our menu... Natsume: That's very commendable of you. I'm impressed. Kousei: Thanks. How do you think it tastes? Kanna: I, for one, think it's delicious. It gives the dish a lot more added depth. Nozomi: I think so too. This seems like it'd be a real crowd-pleaser. Natsume: It certainly is delicious, but... Kousei: But? Natsume: I feel like the pepper's unique smokiness has a sort of... mature taste to it. Natsume: It's definitely not bad by any means, but--and this is just my personal opinion... Natsume: But I think I actually prefer the regular carbonara. Natsume: So while I'm all for adding this to our menu, I don't think it should replace the original version. Nozomi: You said you added the smoked black pepper to the pasta at the end, right? Kousei: Yeah, I did. Nozomi: In that case, why don't we just serve our regular carbonara with a shaker of smoked black pepper on the side? Nozomi: That way, customers can add as much or as little as they want. Natsume: How would we know how much to prepare in advance, though? Some customers might use a lot more than others. Suzune: A lot of beef bowl restaurants used to do the same thing with their special shichimi spices, but they had to stop the practice a little while back. Suzune: Some customers were using unbelievable amounts of spice, which ended up hurting their profits. Nozomi: Oh... I guess that won't work then. Kanna: It seems like our safest option would be to add this smoked pepper version as a separate item on the menu. Kousei: Alright. So I have all the judges' approval? Kanna: Absolutely. I think this would make a fine addition to our menu. Nozomi: Me too. Natsume: Me three. Kanna: What do you think, Mikado-san? Mikado: I believe Natsume mentioned earlier that this dish had a rather mature taste. However, many of our customers also come here specifically for our coffee and tea. Mikado: Judging from what I have gathered, this would suit their preferences well. Mikado: Therefore, I am in agreement. Kousei: Thank goodness... Mei: Way to go, Senpai! Kousei: Thanks! Kousei: I was just gonna do it at home, actually... Mikado: Among other problems, that would be quite expensive. I would not recommend you do that. Kousei: I guess that's true. Mikado: I do have some other ideas you may wish to consider. Are you free to talk after this? Kousei: Sure. I've got time. Kanna: In that case, let's call it a day here. See you tomorrow, everyone. Natsume: See you tomorrow. Nozomi: See you tomorrow! Kousei: Phew... Kousei: Huh? Hiuchidani-san? Mei: Hey. Kousei: What are you still doing here? Mei: I was waiting for you to finish. Kousei: You could've waited inside. Mei: Ahaha. I didn't want to bother you guys. Mei: Anyway, I know I should've said something earlier... but would you mind walking me home? Kousei: Sure. I don't mind. Let's go. Mei: Thanks! Mei: Congratulations on getting your new recipe approved, by the way. Kousei: Well, you helped with that. Mei: Not at all. You did this on your own, Senpai. Kousei: Nah, it's all thanks to you. I would've never come up with this idea on my own. Kousei: Seriously, thank you. I'm really grateful. Kousei: This might sound kind of melodramatic... but I think I've gained a little more confidence in myself now. Mei: Ehehe... You're gonna make me blush. I don't mean to sound melodramatic either, but, like... Mei: You've done a lot for me as well, Senpai. Ever since you've helped me open up about my left eye, I feel like a huge weight's been lifted off my shoulders. Mei: That's why I wanted to be able to return the favor if I could. Mei: I'm glad I managed to be of some small help to you. Kousei: It wasn't small at all. You were a big help. Kousei: I was hoping to do something like this before I had to deal with my exams, so I'm glad it all went so well. Mei: Oh, your exams are coming up? Kousei: At the end of the month, yeah. Mei: Does that mean you're gonna be working fewer hours? Kousei: No, I'll be working the same as usual. I'll do fine as long as I pay attention in class. Kousei: And I can always study after work too. Mei: You're a pretty diligent student, aren't you? Kousei: I don't know about that... I'm just the sort of guy who hates procrastinating. Mei: That's what it means to be diligent, Senpai. I think that's something to be proud of. Kousei: Nah, trust me... I can be pretty lazy when I want. Mei: But in front of me, at least, you're always hardworking and dependable. Kousei: Okay, sheesh. Stop flattering me. It's gonna go to my head. Mei: Ahaha! Alright. Mei: Well, good night, Senpai. Kousei: Good night. And sorry you had to wait for me earlier. Mei: That's okay. I waited because I wanted to congratulate you. Mei: Anyway, see you tomorrow! Kousei: Yeah. See you tomorrow. Mei: ...... Mei: Hmm... Exams... , Mei: Phew. I thought I was running late, but it looks like you arrived at the same time as me. Kousei: Yeah, I just got out of class. Kousei: Shiki-san and Nozomi should already be here, so let's head inside. Mei: Okay. Mei: Good morning! Kanna: Welcome, you two. Mei: It's a little weird being greeted with a \"Welcome\" when the cafe's closed. Kanna: Then by that logic, saying \"Good morning\" is weird too, no? We're not working. Mei: I guess that's true. Kanna: You're here to study for your exams, right? Natsume-san and Nozomi-san are already here. Kousei: Yeah, sorry. Nozomi: It's fine. You two were in class. Natsume: You don't have to apologize. It's no big deal to us. Kanna: What would everyone like to drink? I'll prepare some refreshments. Nozomi: Huh? But... Kanna: It's no trouble at all. If it'll help you focus on your studies, I'd be happy to help. Nozomi: That's really nice of you. In that case, I'll have a cup of Earl Grey. Mei: Can I get a glass of orange juice? Kanna: Sure. Kanna: What about you two? Natsume: I'll have an Earl Grey too. Kousei: I'll have a coffee. Kanna: Alright. Kousei: Let's get to it then. Did you manage to find the stuff I asked for? Natsume: Here. These were the only ones I had left. Kousei: Thanks. These should help. Natsume: We might be in different majors, but you managed to get into Hitotsuboshi too, so you had to have gotten high grades yourself. Kousei: Well, I had a lot of help, as I'm sure you can imagine. Plus, my grades were only just barely good enough to be accepted. Nozomi: Urgh. These tests are crazy. I can't even figure out this last question with the answer in front of me. Mei: I'm getting a headache just looking at it. Kousei: Yeah, there are quite a few nasty questions in here. Natsume: You can thank my teacher, Saeki-sensei, for that. Apparently, he was a huge math buff. Natsume: Rumor had it he made these questions specifically to be solved using applied mathematics, just to show students the beauty of mathmatics. Nozomi: I'm going to go out on a limb and say he didn't succeed. Natsume: Yeah, most of us couldn't stand his class. Not that we hated him, per se; he was a fine person, just his tests were awful. Mei: That's what I hear too. Kousei: This teacher still teaches there? Mei: Yeah, he sure does. Kousei: Well, these tests should be great reference material then. Kousei: As for the English ones, all these questions seem pretty standard. Natsume: At least when I was there, the only subject that had insanely difficult questions was math. Kousei: Good. Then as long as we use these tests and the textbook to review, you should be able to avoid failing. Natsume: Sounds like a lot of rote memorization, though. Kousei: It'll have to do, for now. There's not enough time for her to re-learn all the material. Mei: Thank you very much. Nozomi: At the moment, I guess I'm struggling with Natsume-san's math questions the most. Nozomi: An in-depth explanation would really help. Natsume: Alright. I'll walk you both through it, so listen up. Nozomi: Okay! Mei: I'm all ears. Mei: Thank you! Nozomi: Sorry for the trouble. And thanks. Natsume: Thank you for doing this, Akizuki-san. Natsume: So anyway--if I apply this formula here, using the value I calculated above, that should give me the answer. Does that make sense? Nozomi: Ahh, I see. Now that you explain it like that, I sort of understand... Maybe... Maybe not? Mei: You're amazing, Nozomi-chan. I still don't get it at all! Natsume: Well, that's no surprise. You're learning from scratch. Natsume: I'll try to explain it as simply as I can, okay? But let me know right away if there's something you don't understand. Mei: Okaaay... *sigh*... Kousei: You're sighing way too much. Natsume: If you're not having any trouble with what I just explained, Sumizome-san, you can go ahead and start studying something else. Nozomi: Well, I wouldn't say I fully understand it yet. Nozomi: Alright, though. Can I borrow your English test? I want to use it to study. Natsume: Be my guest. Mei: Sorry I'm delaying us, Nozomi-san. Nozomi: Hey, it's not a big deal. Nozomi: The whole reason we're having this study session is to learn! Nozomi: So let's work hard and do our best to pass, okay? Mei: Yeah! Kanna: And here's your coffee, Takamine-san. Kousei: Oh, thanks. Kanna: By the way, what are you doing? Kousei: I'm putting together a list of stuff I want to cover. Kanna: Oh, okay. Preparing your teaching materials. Would you like me to help? Kousei: You'd be willing? Kanna: Don't worry. I can at least help you organize everything. Kanna: Everyone's studying their hardest. I want to chip in to help too. Kousei: Alright. Grab a seat. Kanna: Thank you. Nozomi: Kousei-kun, can I ask you something? Kousei: What's up? Nozomi: How come the answer to this one is number two? The other choices sound like they make sense too. Kousei: Hm? Let me see. Ah. Well, if you look at the paragraph before the blank, you can tell whether it's a factual or hypothetical statement. Kousei: The question is asking about something that happened in the past, so the answer has to be number two. Number one is a conjunction, so that wouldn't make sense. See? There's a comma here. Nozomi: Oh, you're right! Urk... Why didn't I catch that? Kousei: It's an easy mistake to make. This whole section can be a little tricky. Kousei: But it's something you need to know. You'll find these sorts of questions on the English proficiency test as well. Nozomi: Really? Alright, thanks. I'd better study it some more then. Kanna: You're actually quite smart, aren't you, Takamine-san? Nozomi: You wouldn't think it, would you? We've known each other for ages, and he always helps me study for tests, but even I still can't believe it sometimes. Nozomi: I never see him cramming at home, so I have no idea how his grades are so good. Kousei: Hey, I put in the effort just like everybody else. Kanna: Is that true? Kousei: The most efficient way to retain information is to pay attention in class. That, and taking notes. Kousei: If I do that, a single glance is all it takes to remember what I learned, which also helps me cut down on review time. Kanna: More haste, less speed, as they say. Nozomi: He's been saying that stuff for years. But if it was that easy to pay attention in class, we wouldn't be asking for help in the first place. Nozomi: Ugh, I can't do this. My concentration is shot. Mei: Me too. It feels like my brain is about to burn out... *sputter* *sputter*... Natsume: Oh, it's getting quite late. Alright. Let's call it a day. Mei: *siiigh* Thank you very much... Nozomi: Thank you! Natsume: You're welcome. So what do you think? Feeling a little more confident now? Mei: Uhh, yeah. I think I understand a bit more now... sort of. Natsume: Ah. Well, I'm glad my explanations made sense to you. Mei: I'll try reviewing everything again once I get home. Natsume: If there's anything you don't understand, let me know. Natsume: Even if it's something we've gone over already, don't be embarrassed. It happens sometimes. Mei: Okay. Thank you for your help. Kousei: Why don't we get you to take the same tests Shiki-san lent us tomorrow? Kousei: After you review the questions you get wrong, you can retake them again the next day. Natsume: I think that's a good idea too. Mei: But, like, won't I just be solving the same questions over and over? Natsume: There's nothing wrong with that. The worst thing would be for you to only think you understand. Kousei: Yeah, the goal here is to make sure you comprehend what you're learning. Kousei: If you can get the same grades Shiki-san did, you should be able to pass your exams without a hitch. But simply memorizing her answers won't mean anything. Mei: Yes, I know. Kousei: Are you okay with that too, Nozomi? Nozomi: Sounds good to me. Natsume: Starting tomorrow, I want you to come in to the cafe even on your days off. Kousei: We'll be able to help you study if you use the break room. Though it'll have to be while we're on the job. Mei: Alright. Thank you kindly. Kanna: Also, take these. I made copies of all your English and Japanese history study materials. Nozomi: Thank you so much! Kousei: Japanese history will largely be pure memorization, but for English, make sure you think about your answers carefully and review them. Mei: I will. Kousei: And thanks for helping out too, Akizuki-san. Kanna: Not at all. Helping people in need is also a part of my job now. Mei: Thanks for everything today. Natsume: Don't thank us just yet. Thank us once you've passed your exams. Mei: True. Alright then! I'll do my best! Nozomi: I'm hooome. Rokurou: Welcome back, Nozomi. Rokurou: Pretty late today, aren't you? I thought you didn't have work on Wednesdays. Nozomi: I was studying with a friend today. Kousei-kun and one of my coworkers were helping us prepare for our mid-terms. Nozomi: I wasn't playing around, so relax. Rokurou: That's not really what I'm worried about... Rokurou: I'm glad to see you working so hard, but make sure you don't overdo it. Rokurou: You've been staying up rather late these days, haven't you? Pulling all-nighters isn't good for your health. Nozomi: I know, geez. That's why I'm doing this now, so I don't have to stay up all night. Nozomi: Anyway, I'm going back to my room to do a bit more review. Rokurou: Don't you want to take a bath? Nozomi: Later. Nozomi: ...... Nozomi: ...... Nozomi: ... Nozomi: Nh... Ngh! Ahh, it's already this late? Nozomi: *sigh*... I studied a whole, whole lot. I've never been able to do this much on my own before. Nozomi: I'd better go take a bath now. If I don't get some sleep soon, I won't be able to wake up on time tomorrow. , Mei: Ah, Senpai! Kousei: Hey. You know, I just realized something after seeing your outfit. Mei: What's that? Kousei: You're on winter break. Mei: Ahaha! Seriously? Why do you think we're meeting up this early in the day? Kousei: True. For some reason, I guess I assumed you'd want to put all this off until after the holidays. Mei: I don't want school getting in the way. Plus, Suzune-san says we're going to be ridiculously busy on Christmas. Kousei: You're working on Christmas? Mei: Yep. I specifically asked to. Kousei: You aren't doing anything with your friends? Mei: Ahaha... Well, they've all got boyfriends, so... Kousei: Ah. Not too surprising then. Mei: You're working Christmas too, aren't you? And Christmas Eve as well, if I recall. Kousei: Yeah. I don't have any plans either, so I figured I might as well. Mei: Sad being single, isn't it? Kousei: Yeah... Mei: Well, not exactly. I recognize her, but I doubt she recognizes me. Mei: Yep. I thought I recognized her from somewhere, so I came here yesterday to double-check. And I was right. Kousei: Didn't take us long to find her, did it? Come to think of it, this is where you and I found out about Yuina's dad too. Mei: Hey, you're right! Maybe this is a lucky place. Kousei: Maybe. Or maybe it's you. Mei: Huh? Me? Kousei: It almost feels like you have a knack for running into people with butterflies or something. Mei: I'm not really sure how to feel about that. Kousei: Sorry. Just a thought. Kousei: Me neither. Mei: Weird. Maybe she isn't the same person? Kousei: Or maybe she already solved her own issues before we could intervene? Mei: I wonder... Hm? Wait, wh-what? Kousei: I see it. Mei: I've never seen anyone's wisps appear and disappear like that. Kousei: What do you mean? Mei: Ah. The guy's back. Kousei: ...... Mei: ...... Kousei: The butterfly's flying away. Mei: You're right. I... can't see the wisp anymore. Kousei: Hmm... Mei: Maybe that man has powers too. Powers like mine. Kousei: The power to repel butterflies, instead of attracting them? It's possible, I guess... Mei: Ah. We probably look really suspicious right now, don't we? Kousei: Huh? Oh, right. Why don't we go over there? Kousei: Hmm. Let's try giving Akizuki-san a call first. Kousei: This could be an unusual case, so we don't want to act rashly. Mei: Okay. Good point! Kanna: Hello? Kousei: This is Takamine. Kanna: Do you need something? Kanna: You said the butterfly disappears whenever this coworker of hers is nearby, correct? Kousei: Yeah. And whenever he leaves, the butterfly comes back. Kousei: Hiuchidani-san thought that maybe the man had some kind of power to repel butterflies... Kanna: *sigh* I didn't think you two were THIS obtuse... Kousei: Come again? Kanna: She's obviously lovestruck. Kousei: What? Sh-She's in love? Kanna: She is. If I had to guess, I'd say that this woman is secretly in love with her coworker. Kousei: She has a crush on him? Wait, really? That's why she's attracting butterflies? Kanna: Hey, don't be so dismissive of the power of love. Kanna: It has the power to incite our deepest, darkest passions. Love inflames the soul, for better or for worse. Kanna: And I would daresay that love is what's thrown that woman's emotions into turmoil. Kanna: She feels happy when they're together, but depressed when they're apart. Kanna: That would explain why the butterfly comes and goes like that. Kousei: I... guess? Kanna: She's probably agonizing over whether or not to confess her feelings to him. Kanna: But if she continues to remain under the butterfly's influence, she may lose hope and decide to give up on him altogether. Kousei: So we should use Hiuchidani-san's powers to capture her butterfly to prevent that from happening? Kanna: To be honest, I'm not entirely sure. If she ends up being rejected anyway, she may become even MORE susceptible to the butterfly's influence. Kanna: I'll leave it up to you to decide what to do, though. And again, please try not to draw unnecessary attention to yourselves. Kousei: I know. Thanks for the help, Akizuki-san. Kousei: Yeah. Apparently, the woman's in love with her coworker, and that's why her emotions are so unstable. Mei: Ohh... Sh-She's in love... That was why! Mei: Th-This feels, like, really embarrassing to say, even though she's a complete stranger... Kousei: It's almost Christmas too. She might be thinking about confessing to him tomorrow or the day after. Mei: Wh-What? Mei: Ngh... Ahh! Kousei: Y-You okay? Mei: I-I'm sorry. I'm just, um, not really used to talking about these sorts of things... Mei: It's getting me a little too worked up... Kousei: Want me to go get you something to drink? Mei: N-No, I'm fine... Kousei: Right. Whenever she's together with him, her spirits temporarily lift, which is why the wisp disappears. Kousei: But when they're apart, she goes back to feeling anxious, which is when the wisp returns. Kousei: Or at least, that's what Akizuki-san's theory is. Mei: Hrmm... Mei: ...... Mei: What if... Kousei: Hm? Mei: What if we do nothing and just let things run their course? Mei: Her wisp already goes away on its own from time to time without me having to make it disappear. Mei: I'm not sure I should be interfering... Kousei: Well... I suppose Akizuki-san DID say the situation wasn't urgent. Kousei: Trust me, you'd know if it was. There'd be a lot more butterflies. Kousei: That woman only has one or two around her at most, so she isn't terribly affected by them. At least, for now. Kousei: Even if we do nothing, it's possible that she'll overcome their influence on her own and confess her feelings. Kousei: But that said, we could still be way off mark. It may have nothing to do with love. Mei: Oh, true... There could be something else that's troubling her. Kousei: From Mikado's point of view, her personal problems aren't really our concern. The important thing is that we catch the butterfly. Mei: Yeah. That's their job, after all. Mei: Then I guess this was our only choice from the start... Mei: It's done. Kousei: Wow. Mei: Huh? Kousei: That was incredible. Beautiful, even. Mei: W-Was it? I can't really tell, myself... Kousei: It definitely looks like she has. Mei: I hope it goes well... Kousei: That's up to her. All we can do is pray that it does. Mei: Yeah. Kousei: If she gets rejected, though... Mei: Hey, don't say that, Senpai. You're gonna jinx it! Kousei: M-My bad. Kousei: Anyway, we've done all we can. The rest is out of our hands. Mei: Alrighty. Mission complete! Kousei: Yep. Not that I actually did anything. Mei: Ahaha! You phoned for help. That counts plenty, I think. Kousei: It'd feel weird to just go home now... Why don't we grab a drink or something? Mei: Good idea! I also want to see if anything happens between those two. Kousei: In that case, how about we get-- Mei: Let's get smoothies! Kousei: Thought you'd say that. Mei: Thanks for paying for me again. Kousei: No problem. It can be your reward for catching the butterfly. Mei: Hehe. You're the best. Mei: By the way, I heard that we're going to be helping bake cakes tomorrow. Kousei: Oh, right. Apparently we received a lot more orders than we expected, so we need all hands on deck. Kousei: Suzune-san wants everyone to pitch in and help. Mei: My shift doesn't start till the afternoon, though. Will I even make it in time to help? Kousei: Suzune-san says we'll be baking them so they're ready just in time for customers to pick up. Kousei: So don't worry. There's gonna be plenty of work to go around. Mei: Alrighty! I don't know if I'll be any good at baking, though... Kousei: You'll probably be put in charge of sales. Mei: Oh, right. I guess we can't have everyone making cakes. Mei: Sounds like it's gonna be a pretty tough day tomorrow. Let's get through this together! Kousei: It'll definitely be busy, but at least we'll get to spend the holidays together with everyone at the cafe. Mei: Ahaha! True that. Mei: Oh, Senpai! Look! Kousei: And it must've gone well. Mei: Yeah! I'm so happy for her. Mei: A Christmas date with her crush... How nice. Kousei: Too bad the only date we have is our jobs. Mei: Urk... Talk about depressing... Kousei: Well, you ready to get going? Mei: Sure. Kousei: We can tell Akizuki-san what happened tomorrow. It's gonna be a busy day, so we should get home early and rest up. Mei: Oh, well I wouldn't mind going to tell her right now, actually! Kousei: You just want to play with Mikado some more, don't you? Mei: Urk... How'd you know? Kousei: It was written all over your face. Mei: Ngh... Can you blame me?! His amazing fluffiness is enough to make anyone go crazy! Mei: Ah. I can be a little too candid sometimes, can't I? I'm sorry. I'll try to be more careful. Kousei: Eh, I don't mind. Feel free to be yourself. I'd prefer that, actually. Mei: Really? Well, please forgive me if I start acting too friendly. Ehehe. Mei: Welp, let's go on home! Kousei: Sounds like a plan. Mei: Let's work real hard tomorrow! Kousei: O-Okay... Kanna: Yes... Nozomi: I-I'll try to hang in there... Kanna: Still, it's not all bad. We wouldn't have gotten such a flood of orders if people didn't love your cakes. Nozomi: Even at my school, there are a ton of kids who are fans of your baking. Suzune: Well, I am a professional. Can't go losing to other restaurants in terms of quality. Suzune: Though... I do apologize for biting off more than I could chew. I knew I should've put a limit on the number of orders. Kousei: But it wasn't an impossible amount. We're nearly there. Kanna: Yeah. Let's hang in there just a little bit longer! Nozomi: Okay! Suzune: You can say that again. I'm exhausted... Natsume: I thought selling cakes would be easier than baking them... Boy, was I wrong. Kousei: I never stepped out of the kitchen today, but there must've been a crazy number of customers. Mei: You wouldn't believe it. We somehow managed to pull through with the three of us, but we could barely keep up. Natsume: Even without counting the people who were here to pick up advance orders, there were a ton of customers who came to buy our regular cakes too... Mei: But even those were flying off the shelves. Natsume: Yeah. I know you guys tried to restock them as fast as you could, but even then they would sell out almost instantly. Suzune: That's probably what I regret the most. Shouldn't have prioritized the advance orders so much. Mikado: Now I understand where the phrase \"selling like hotcakes\" comes from. It's incredible the effect the Christmas holidays have on sales. Kousei: Coming from someone on the kitchen side, you don't know the half of it. Suzune: I mean, they say sales typically go up tenfold on Christmas Eve. Cake stores everywhere are working overtime. Nozomi: Even though Christmas itself is tomorrow, it almost feels like we had more advance orders for today. Suzune: Yep. Christmas Eve is usually the peak in terms of sales. But make no mistake, we'll still be plenty busy tomorrow as well. Natsume: It's an excellent business opportunity, for sure. That said, I'm kind of worried that we're working you too hard, Suzune-san. Suzune: I could say the same for the rest of you. We've gotta strike while the iron's hot, though, so let's keep it up for one more day. Kanna: Agreed. Let's all get a good night's rest so we can be ready for tomorrow. Natsume: See you tomorrow, everyone. Mei & Nozomi: See you all tomorrow! Mei: Y-Yes. Mikado: Mei. Mei: Yes? Mikado: Why are you staring at me with those bloodshot eyes? Mei: I was, um... wondering if you could transform back into your-- Mikado: No. Mei: ...... Kanna: I've never seen anyone's spirits drop that fast. Mikado: Good grief. I am not your pet cat. Mei: You're right. I'm sorry... Mikado: So, what happened after you captured the butterfly? Kousei: She seemed to brighten up considerably. Kousei: And I'm positive that change was due to the influence of Hiuchidani-san's power. Kousei: But assuming we were right about her being lovestruck, she'll most likely become depressed again if she's dumped, so we may have to monitor her situation again if that happens. Kanna: You're sure she didn't notice you two at all? Mei: No. We never got close to her, so I don't think she could've noticed us. Mikado: Even if she had noticed you, I doubt the woman would have linked you to the improvement in her mood. Mikado: The important thing is that you managed to capture the butterfly. Now all that's left is for Mei to learn how to release it. Mei: I'll try my best! Kanna: Just remember to practice only when we're around, and not on your own. Kanna: If you were to accidentally release your butterflies by mistake, there's no telling what effect it could have on the people around you. Mei: Got it! Mikado: You've done well. Make sure you get plenty of rest tonight. Mei: I will! Thank you! Kanna: Have a good night, you two. Kousei: Good night. Mei: Hey, Senpai! You wanna stop by someplace with me? Kousei: I was about to suggest the same thing. You want to go see how that woman's doing, right? Mei: Ahaha. I'm just curious. Mei: I have the feeling she won't be at the store, but it wouldn't hurt to take a look. Kousei: Yeah. Mei: Alright! Let's go. Mei: Hmm... Looks like I was right. Kousei: Guess she isn't here. Mei: She's probably out somewhere with her crush right now. Kousei: Maybe. Probably not here at the mall, though. Mei: Ahaha. Yeah. Who would want to go on a date where they work? Mei: But even if they were here, we wouldn't be able to spot them with how many people there are. Kousei: True. Nothing but Christmas couples as far as the eye can see. Mei: ...... Kousei: Hm? Mei: N-Nothing. It's just... you're a guy and I'm a girl, so... Mei: Other people might think we're a couple too, and that's a little embarrassing... Kousei: You don't want to be seen with me? Ouch... Mei: N-No, that's not what I meant! Kousei: I'm kidding, I'm kidding. You really aren't good with romance and stuff, are you? Mei: I-I'm just not used to it, I guess... Mei: ...... Mei: Say, Senpai... What do you think of me? Kousei: Huh? Wh-Wh-What do you mean? Mei: W-Wait, that came out wrong! I don't mean it like THAT! Mei: I mean, what do you think of me as a person? What kind of impression do you have of me? Kousei: O-Oh, uh, let me think... Mei: Do you think I'm rude, or difficult to approach? Kousei: Oh, no. I've never thought of you as that. Mei: Really? Kousei: Really. If anything, you're the opposite. I've always thought you were very cheery and easy to talk to. Mei: Ah... Thank goodness. I guess I'm doing a good job then... Kousei: What do you mean? Mei: ...... Mei: This might be a little off topic, but... Kousei: I'm listening. Mei: I once told my mom and dad about my eye too. Mei: But they seemed to think I was joking, so they just laughed it off. Mei: Even when I started growing out my bangs, they thought I was just going through my... what'cha call it... my edgy phase? Mei: That's when I realized I wasn't normal, and they didn't understand me. Mei: Ever since then, I stopped talking to people. Mei: It might be a bit dramatic to say I was traumatized by the experience... Mei: But in a way, I sort of was. It's always there, in the back of my mind. Mei: The frustration of not being understood. Mei: The burden of having to hide who I really am. Mei: I know I'm not normal. The truth is, I'm constantly afraid that I'll never fit in with those around me. Kousei: What do you mean? If anything, you're always the center of attention. Kousei: Out of all of us, you're undoubtedly the best at handling customers. Everyone at the cafe relies on you. Mei: Ahaha. Thank you. I appreciate it. Mei: You know, I wish I could work at the cafe forever. Mei: It makes me incredibly happy to know that I finally met other people who completely understand me. Mei: I've never cared much about the Christmas holidays, honestly... Mei: I might not have a boyfriend to spend it with, but at least I got to spend it with people who understand me. Mei: So thank you, Senpai. Mei: Thank you for paying attention to me. Kousei: I'm, er... glad I could help you be yourself. Mei: Absolutely! Kousei: Don't sweat it. I've got a bit of an unusual situation of my own, actually. Kousei: I understand how it feels, not being normal. Mei: You do? Kousei: There's a bit of a problem with my soul, you see. And I'm looking for a way to fix it. Mei: Is there anything I can do to help? Kousei: Well... Mei: Oh. Well, let me know if there's ever anything I can do to help! Kousei: I will. Thanks. Mei: Hey, I've got an idea! Like, this is way off topic, but just hear me out. Kousei: Hm? Mei: Let's go get another smoothie! Kousei: Sure. Guess that's sort of our tradition now, every time we come here. Mei: Ahaha! I guess so! But let me pay for you this time! Kousei: Nah, you don't have to. Mei: Nuh-uh, I am. I still haven't paid you back for helping me study for my mid-terms. Kousei: Seeing your grades go up was reward enough for me. Mei: Nice try, but I'm paying for you, whether you like it or not! Mei: Now come on, let's go! Kousei: Alright, alright. \n\nWhile these examples may provide some guidance, evaluate their relevance to the current conversation.

Kousei: Hold on a minute. We have to take a picture first! Miyu: Aww... Kanna: Now, now. No frowning. Give me a big, wide smile. Kanna: If you don't, you know what's going to happen! Tickle, tickle, tickle! Miyu: Ahaha! Mommy, that tickles! Kanna: Come on, sweetie. Smile, smile! Miyu: I am smiling! Ahaha! Kousei: Look this way, Miyu. Kanna: Tickle, tickle, tickle! Miyu: Mooommy! I said it tickles! Kanna: Come on, look at the camera. Kousei: Happy birthday, Miyu. Kanna: Happy birthday! Miyu: Thanks! Ehehe. ",
            "Kanna: I'm sorry. I should've done more prior research. Kousei: Still, it's nowhere near as busy as it was on Christmas. Kousei: And honestly, it's probably better that it's a little crowded. Kanna: Why do you say that? Kousei: Well, now we have a reason to stick to each other more closely. Kanna: That's a wonderful way of looking at it. Kanna: Me too. Nihihi. Kousei: So, where should we go first? Kanna: Hmm... Why don't we start by going where you want to? Kousei: Alright. The haunted house it is. Kanna: ...... Kanna: You bully. Kousei: Sorry. Just kidding. Kousei: Let's start with a thrill ride then. That okay with you? Kanna: Of course. Let's go. Kousei: Oh--but you should probably go to the bathroom first this time. Kanna: You really are a bully. Kousei: Don't worry. Even if you do pee your pants, I'll still love you. Kanna: And you have no tact either. Kousei: If anything, I might fall in love with you even more. Kanna: Not only that, but you're a huge pervert too! Kanna: Why on earth did I fall in love with this person again? Kousei: C'mon, it's just a light joke. You don't have to respond so seriously. It kinda hurts, you know. Kanna: It's hard to tell with you sometimes. Kousei: Whoaaaa! Kanna: The sunset looks beautiful too. Kousei: Yeah. It really is... Kousei: Nope. Just admiring how cute my girlfriend is. Kanna: ...... Kousei: I'm being serious, you know? Kanna: I know. It's embarrassing because you said it with such seriousness... Kanna: But thank you. I love you too. Kousei: You don't know how happy hearing that makes me. Kanna: I really appreciate you humoring my selfish wish today. Kousei: I don't think there's anything selfish about wanting to spend time with your boyfriend. Kanna: Keep that up, and I'm going to start saying things like \"What's more important, me or your job?\" Do you want that? Kousei: I mean, the answer is you, obviously. I don't care about work. Kousei: In fact, who even needs a job? I'm staying home all day! Leave the housework to me! Kanna: You're exactly the kind of person who'd say that. *giggle* Kanna: I must have seen countless sunsets before... but I don't think I've ever seen one this breathtaking. Kousei: Probably because you're seeing it together with someone you love, huh? Kanna: Yeah. You may be right. Kanna: Ever since we started spending time together, I've been having so much fun each and every day. Kousei: Th-Thanks... Although it's a little embarrassing hearing you admit it so readily. Kanna: Well, it's the truth. Kanna: Even when I can't see you, you're all I think about. Even when we do get to see each other, but things don't go as planned... it never stops being fun. Kanna: Every day, I think about what I want to talk to you about next, what I want to do together next-- Kanna: For the first time in my life, I can't wait to see what tomorrow holds. Kousei: Me too. Before I sleep, I always think about you, or the next time I get to see you. Kanna: Thank you for not giving up on me when I tried to run away back then. Kanna: Thanks to you, I discovered what true happiness feels like. Kousei: ...... Kanna: Now that I've experienced this feeling of bliss, I'm hopelessly addicted. Kanna: Even once I'm reincarnated, I'm sure I'll find happiness again. I plan on spending each day like today, looking forward to the next. I'm certain of it. Kanna: So please don't forget, Kousei-san. Kousei: How could I ever forget the girl who turned down my first ever confession? Kanna: There you go, rubbing salt in the wound again... Kanna: But it's not me myself that I don't want you to forget about... Kousei: I know. Kousei: There's no way I'd forget how amazing our first kiss was either. I can't really explain it well, but it was just... amazing. Kanna: That's not what I meant either, and you know it. Kousei: What? Are you saying that kiss meant nothing to you? Kanna: Of course not... It felt amazing for me too. More amazing than words can describe. Kousei: Right? Kanna: I'm so happy right now. Kousei: Me too. Kanna: But you haven't forgotten what you promised me, have you? Kousei: No. I remember. Kanna: Will you be able to keep your promise? Kousei: I'm not a kid. Of course I will. Kanna: I'm holding you to it. You'd better not forget. Kousei: I won't. Kanna: I want you to find your own happiness, for real this time. Kousei: What do you mean \"for real\"? I'm already happy right now. Kanna: I guess so. Nihihi. Kanna: ...... Kanna: You know something, Kousei-san? Kousei: Yeah? Kanna: I really love you. Kousei: I love you too, Kanna. Kousei: I love you. Kousei: I love you... Kousei: ...... Mikado: Kanna has departed now, I take it? Kousei: Yeah. I thought I'd come to tell you... but I guess you already knew. Mikado: Yes. I have known her for quite a long time, after all. Mikado: And she had already requested that I find another employee to fill in for her after her departure. Kousei: Ah. Kousei: ...... Kousei: I know this might be a bit late, but can I ask you something? Mikado: What? Kousei: Do you think I managed to make her happy? Kousei: Was she happy enough to overcome her past? Mikado: Well, you certainly made her happy enough to squeal with joy. In fact, she would not shut up about you. Mikado: At the very least, those were her true feelings. That much I can confirm. Kousei: Alright. Kousei: I know. Mikado: If fate permits it, however... you may end up meeting each other once again. Kousei: I can meet her again? Like, in the future? Mikado: Indeed. However, since she is going to be reborn, she will certainly end up younger than you... Kousei: ...... Mikado: It may even be possible for her to be reincarnated as your own daughter one day. Mikado: If that happens, I trust that you will shower her with love and make her happy. Kousei: My daughter? You're kidding... Kousei: I can't even begin to imagine that. Mikado: Quite understandable. Kousei: Well, anyway, that's all I came here to tell you. Mikado: Thank you. I appreciate it. Mikado: At any rate, you ought to rest for today. It will help to calm you down. Kousei: You say that... but I'm not sure it will. Mikado: I understand that it is hard, but still. Mikado: Like I said, this was for the sake of Kanna's happiness. You will simply have to accept that. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Brr... It's freezing. Kousei: ...... ",
            "Mikado: Is not about the carbonara, no. I shall leave that matter completely up to you. Kousei: Alright. I'll try preparing a few more dishes next week as an experiment. Maybe up the order limit to twenty-five. Kanna: Sounds good. Anyway, I'm sure you can guess why I've asked you two to stay behind. Mei: This is about my eye again, isn't it? Kanna: We just want to know how things are progressing, so this shouldn't take too much of your time. Has anything changed with your eye since we last spoke? Mei: No. I still don't know how to release my butterflies... Kanna: Not to worry. I'm certain you'll get there eventually. Mikado: Our main purpose in opening this cafe has always been to collect butterflies. Thanks to you, that task has been proceeding expeditiously. Mikado: Allow me to thank you for your hard work once again. We owe you our gratitude. Mei: A-All I'm doing is catching butterflies. I'd wouldn't exactly call that \"hard work\"... Mei: B-But either way, I'll continue to do my best to help! Mikado: Thank you. We appreciate it. Mei: ...... Mikado: But while I appreciate your efforts, I will not be transforming into a cat. Mei: Okay. I'm sorry. Kanna: Allow me to thank you as well, Takamine-san. Kousei: Huh? Why me? Kanna: While it was mere coincidence that brought you here to work with us, you've become an invaluable member of our team. Kanna: Many of our customers even come to our cafe specifically to eat your dishes now. Kanna: So thank you very much. You've been an incredible help to us all. Kousei: Well, I mean... this was all because of that \"problem\" I had with my soul in the first place... Kousei: But I'm glad you appreciate me. Honestly, this job has been pretty fulfilling for me too lately. Mikado: Indeed. It would appear your soul's condition has been greatly improving. Kanna: You can't let your guard down just yet, but as long as you keep heading in the right direction, you won't have anything to worry about. Kousei: Phew. That's a relief to hear. I owe it all to Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Huh? Kousei: Thanks for guiding me in the right direction. Mei: N-No, I didn't do anything. Kousei: You did. Thank you for everything. Mei: I-I... Mei: ...... Mei: U-Um, was there anything else you wanted to discuss? Kanna: No, I believe that's it. Mei: In that case, I've got something I need to do, so--! Mikado: Alright. Then we apologize for keeping you. Mei: That's okay! Anyway, I'll be going now! Kousei: Let me walk you-- Mei: Good night! Kousei: Huh? Kousei: Y-Yeah, I am... Kanna: Good night. Kousei: Yeah. Good night... Kousei: ...... Kousei: I should've known... Mei: Y-You're fine. Kousei: Freaking out? Mei: Y-Yeah... I... Um... Mei: ...... Mei: Oh, gosh... I'm so nervous... Mei: U-Umm... I think it would take too long to explain myself, so... h-here! Mei: Yes. It's... my Valentine's Day gift... to you. Kousei: Chocolate! Mei: Y-Yes. It's chocolate, and it's, um... handmade. Kousei: Handmade! Mei: Wow, you're really excited about this... Suzune-san taught me how to make it, so it should taste alright... I think. Kousei: Oh... Is that why you've been going home together lately? Mei: Yeah. I've been going to her apartment so she could teach me. Mei: She's also been helping me by asking you about your preferences and stuff... Kousei: My preferences? Oh, wait. Mei: Ahaha... Sorry. I guess I just felt kind of embarrassed... Kousei: Is that why the others said they weren't giving me any chocolate this year? So this would be a surprise? Mei: What? I don't know anything about that... Mei: But the others knew I was planning on giving you my own chocolate, so... I guess that could be why they did that... Kousei: Phew. I thought for sure you hated me or something... Mei: Wh-What?! Of course not! Why would you think that? Kousei: I mean, you've been avoiding me lately, haven't you? Mei: I-I wasn't... I mean... Well, maybe a little... Kousei: See? Mei: That's only because I didn't want you to find out I was preparing chocolate for you... Mei: But... I'm sorry for acting so weird. I didn't mean to give you the wrong idea. Kousei: It's alright. I've been really anxious these past few days, so it's a relief to know the truth. Mei: Urk... I'm sorry... Kousei: Handmade chocolate, though... This is more than I expected. Thank you. Mei: Um, if you'd like... you're welcome to go ahead and eat it... Kousei: Right now? Mei: Yeah. I actually brought you a fork too. Kousei: To be honest, I was planning to go home and savor it there... Mei: N-No, please! You can't! You can't keep me waiting that long! Mei: My heart's already pounding so fast it's about to explode! Mei: I need to know how you think it tastes right now... or else I'm going to die! Kousei: A-Alright. I'll have a bite... Mei: Please do! There are two inside, so at least try one of them! Right now! Mei: Something like that. It's called a chocolate fondant. Kousei: Sounds fancy. Was it hard to make? Mei: Not at all. Suzune-san was there to guide me through every single step. Mei: Ah, but just for the record--I made this all by myself! And I think I did a pretty good job! Mei: Though, um... it was a lot crispier on the outside when it came out of the oven, but it might be a bit soggy by now. Mei: But it shouldn't taste bad! This was Suzune-san's own personal recipe! I baked it with the utmost care! Mei: The flavor should be to your liking as well! So p-please, go ahead and try some! Kousei: Alright... don't mind if I do then. Mei: H-Help yourself! Kousei: ...... Mei: H-Hello? Kousei: ...... Mei: Senpai? Kousei: ...... Mei: Um... Does it... taste bad? Kousei: It's delicious. Mei: R-Really? Oh, thank goodness! Kousei: Oh god... It's so delicious... Mei: Wait, what? Huh? Kousei: How? How can something taste THIS good?! Mei: O-Oh, come on... You're exaggerating... Kousei: *sniffle*... Mei: Wait, are you crying? You're not pretending, are you? No way. Like, seriously? You're seriously crying? Kousei: I can't help it... Mei: O-Okay? Kousei: Everyone kept saying they wouldn't be giving me any chocolate... Mei: Oh... right. They said it'd be a hassle to get return gifts for everyone. Kousei: Even Nozomi, who usually gives me chocolates every year... gave me nothing. Mei: Wait, every year? Oh, right. You and Nozomi-chan are childhood friends. Kousei: Yeah, but she said she'd only been giving them to me out of force of habit... Mei: Oh... Err... I'm not sure what to say to that. Kousei: In the end, the only person who gave me chocolates was you... And handmade chocolate too... Kousei: Thank you... Thank you, Hiuchidani-san! Mei: I didn't think you'd be THIS emotional... but I'm glad you like it. Mei: But I can't say I was expecting you to start crying... It's a little, um, creepy. Kousei: Yeah, I know. I guess I tried too hard to sell it. Mei: Ah! I KNEW you were pretending, you stinker! Mei: Do you really mean that? Kousei: Yeah. I mean it. Seriously. Kousei: I could finish off both these chocolates right here if I'm not careful. Mei: Phew... Kousei: There's no way you could've gone wrong with Suzune-san's recipe. Mei: Yeah, but still... Kousei: Besides, even if it DID taste bad, I'd never say it to your face. Mei: What? So it really DOES taste bad?! Kousei: No, no. It's delicious. Really. Mei: *sigh*... My heart's pounding so much. Like, I've been feeling so anxious lately. That's why I've been acting so weird... Mei: When I was making the chocolate by hand, I began to understand how you feel, Senpai. Mei: Making food for someone else to eat is incredibly stressful and nerve-wracking... Mei: But it's also really fun, trying to make something that the person will like. Mei: And when you do get that confirmation from them that they like it... Mei: It makes you happier than words can describe! Kousei: I already told you. Why don't you believe me? Mei: Because I'm worried! Kousei: Didn't you taste it yourself beforehand? Mei: Well, yeah. I tried one I made from the same batch, but still... Kousei: It was delicious, wasn't it? Mei: It was, but this one's gone all cold! It's not FRESH! Kousei: Even so, it tastes delicious. Mei: Really? Really, really? Kousei: If you're really that worried about the taste, why don't you try some yourself? Kousei: See? I told you. Mei: Phew... Wait. Ah... Ahh! Kousei: What? Mei: Th-Th-Th-That was... an i-i-indirect k-ki--! Kousei: Oh, right. Sorry. You're pretty sensitive about these sorts of things, aren't you? Mei: O-O-Oh, no! It doesn't bothe--well... i-it does, I guess... Kousei: My bad. I totally forgot. Mei: I-I mean... As long as it's you, I... Mei: ...... Mei: U-U-Umm! Kousei: Hm? Mei: Suzune-san told me something... Kousei: Yeah? Mei: She said that you'd be happy receiving any kind of chocolate for Valentine's Day... Kousei: It's true. I'm pretty thrilled right now. Thank you, seriously. Mei: You're welcome... But she also said that... if I gave you handmade chocolate... Mei: Then... Umm... Kousei: Hm? Mei: Then you'd... umm! Kousei: Yeah? Mei: You'd think that... it meant I had genuine feelings for you... Kousei: O-Oh, come on! I can't believe she told you that too! Mei: Y-Yes... That's what she said... Kousei: I, er, I mean... I was only half-joking when I said that... Mei: You were... joking? Kousei: Y-Yeah. I was just messing with her... Kousei: B-But don't worry! I'm not dumb enough to think you like me just because of a couple chocolates! Mei: ...... Mei: I wouldn't mind... if you thought I did... though. Kousei: O-Okay? Kousei: ...... Kousei: Wait, what?! Mei: ...... Kousei: ...... Kousei: ...... Mei: Um... Mei: ...... Mei: During our girls' night out the other day... everyone kept asking me about that time we went to the pool together... Mei: Eventually, the conversation turned to... whether or not I had f-feelings for you, Senpai... Mei: I said I didn't know... but everyone else said it was obvious that I did... Mei: I thought they might be right... but I've never had any sort of romantic experience before... so I wasn't sure. Mei: I can't say I really understand my own feelings... but at the very least, I do know that you're a very important person to me. Mei: That's... what I wanted to tell you today. Mei: But... Mei: ...... Mei: Just now, I realized that... I really do... love you, Senpai. Mei: I mean, love is supposed to make your heart pound, isn't it? But when I'm with you, it's almost the opposite... I feel so relaxed that I thought it couldn't be love. Mei: But right now... my heart is pounding like crazy. Even though all I'm doing is telling you how I feel... my chest feels like it's about to burst. Mei: When I made up my mind to give you these chocolates... and when I decided to ask Suzune-san to teach me how to make them... Mei: While I practiced... This morning... During work... And while I was sitting here waiting for you earlier too... Mei: My heart wouldn't stop pounding. Mei: You wouldn't believe how nervous I felt. Mei: The truth is... I've had feelings for you all this time. Mei: So it's time I worked up the courage to say it. Mei: I... I think I love you, Senpai. Mei: No, wait... That doesn't sound right... Mei: ...... Mei: Senpai... I love you. Mei: I love the way you thank me, even when I've barely done anything... Mei: I love the way you're so nice to me, and lend an ear to all my worries... Mei: And I love so many other things about you too. Mei: So please... Mei: ...... Mei: Please... go out with me. Mei: Please... take me as your girlfriend. Mei: I... want to be with you from now on, Senpai. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Right now... my heart's also hammering like crazy. Kousei: When I thought you were avoiding me... it made me feel so lonely and so worried. Kousei: I was afraid you didn't like me, and I became really depressed. Kousei: Especially when you ran off without giving me any chocolate. Kousei: But then--you messaged to ask if we could meet. My heart wouldn't stop pounding on the way here. Kousei: This whole day's been a roller coaster of emotions for me. Kousei: But if what I'm feeling is the same thing you are... then I'm in love too. Kousei: In love with you, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Ah... Urk... Kousei: I love you too, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: S-So... Kousei: I want you to go out with me. Mei: ...... Mei: Ahhh... Mei: I'm a total mess of emotions right now... Kousei: Me too... My face must be burning up right now. Mei: ...... Kousei: ...... Mei: ...... Kousei: Uh... if you don't mind... Mei: Huh? Kousei: Could I call you by your first name? It'd feel oddly formal... if I kept using your last name. Mei: Y-Yeah, I agree... Go ahead. You don't have to use an honorific either... if you don't want. Kousei: Oh... Mei: Yeah. You can just call me Mei. Kousei: M... M-M-M... Mei: You're stammering so much... Kousei: I-I can't help it. I've never called you this before... Mei: That's fine. I can be patient. Kousei: M-Mei... Mei: There you go. Ehehe... Kousei: What about you? Mei: Huh? Kousei: Will you start calling me by my name? Mei: Senpai? Kousei: That's not what it says on my birth certificate. Mei: Urk... Mei: ...... Mei: Kousei... san? Kousei: You can drop the honorific too. Mei: Well... I mean, I'm younger than you, so... Mei: But maybe I could call you Kou-kun instead-- Mei: No, wait. That's even more embarrassing. Kousei: Yeah... That's pretty embarrassing for me too. Mei: Well, for now... I'm only going to use your first name when we're alone together. Kousei: A-Alright.

I wanna eat cake! And I wanna eat omelet rice too! Kanna: Alright. Once we get to the cafe, I'll make it for you. Miyu: Yay! Can we go to the cafe right now then? Kousei: Hold on a minute. We have to take a picture first! Miyu: Aww... Kanna: Now, now. No frowning. Give me a big, wide smile. Kanna: If you don't, you know what's going to happen! Tickle, tickle, tickle! Miyu: Ahaha! Mommy, that tickles! Kanna: Come on, sweetie. Smile, smile! Miyu: I am smiling! Ahaha! Kousei: Look this way, Miyu. Kanna: Tickle, tickle, tickle! Miyu: Mooommy! I said it tickles! Kanna: Come on, look at the camera. Kousei: Happy birthday, Miyu. Kanna: Happy birthday! Miyu: Thanks! Ehehe. , Kanna: I'm sorry. I should've done more prior research. Kousei: Still, it's nowhere near as busy as it was on Christmas. Kousei: And honestly, it's probably better that it's a little crowded. Kanna: Why do you say that? Kousei: Well, now we have a reason to stick to each other more closely. Kanna: That's a wonderful way of looking at it. Kanna: Me too. Nihihi. Kousei: So, where should we go first? Kanna: Hmm... Why don't we start by going where you want to? Kousei: Alright. The haunted house it is. Kanna: ...... Kanna: You bully. Kousei: Sorry. Just kidding. Kousei: Let's start with a thrill ride then. That okay with you? Kanna: Of course. Let's go. Kousei: Oh--but you should probably go to the bathroom first this time. Kanna: You really are a bully. Kousei: Don't worry. Even if you do pee your pants, I'll still love you. Kanna: And you have no tact either. Kousei: If anything, I might fall in love with you even more. Kanna: Not only that, but you're a huge pervert too! Kanna: Why on earth did I fall in love with this person again? Kousei: C'mon, it's just a light joke. You don't have to respond so seriously. It kinda hurts, you know. Kanna: It's hard to tell with you sometimes. Kousei: Whoaaaa! Kanna: The sunset looks beautiful too. Kousei: Yeah. It really is... Kousei: Nope. Just admiring how cute my girlfriend is. Kanna: ...... Kousei: I'm being serious, you know? Kanna: I know. It's embarrassing because you said it with such seriousness... Kanna: But thank you. I love you too. Kousei: You don't know how happy hearing that makes me. Kanna: I really appreciate you humoring my selfish wish today. Kousei: I don't think there's anything selfish about wanting to spend time with your boyfriend. Kanna: Keep that up, and I'm going to start saying things like \"What's more important, me or your job?\" Do you want that? Kousei: I mean, the answer is you, obviously. I don't care about work. Kousei: In fact, who even needs a job? I'm staying home all day! Leave the housework to me! Kanna: You're exactly the kind of person who'd say that. *giggle* Kanna: I must have seen countless sunsets before... but I don't think I've ever seen one this breathtaking. Kousei: Probably because you're seeing it together with someone you love, huh? Kanna: Yeah. You may be right. Kanna: Ever since we started spending time together, I've been having so much fun each and every day. Kousei: Th-Thanks... Although it's a little embarrassing hearing you admit it so readily. Kanna: Well, it's the truth. Kanna: Even when I can't see you, you're all I think about. Even when we do get to see each other, but things don't go as planned... it never stops being fun. Kanna: Every day, I think about what I want to talk to you about next, what I want to do together next-- Kanna: For the first time in my life, I can't wait to see what tomorrow holds. Kousei: Me too. Before I sleep, I always think about you, or the next time I get to see you. Kanna: Thank you for not giving up on me when I tried to run away back then. Kanna: Thanks to you, I discovered what true happiness feels like. Kousei: ...... Kanna: Now that I've experienced this feeling of bliss, I'm hopelessly addicted. Kanna: Even once I'm reincarnated, I'm sure I'll find happiness again. I plan on spending each day like today, looking forward to the next. I'm certain of it. Kanna: So please don't forget, Kousei-san. Kousei: How could I ever forget the girl who turned down my first ever confession? Kanna: There you go, rubbing salt in the wound again... Kanna: But it's not me myself that I don't want you to forget about... Kousei: I know. Kousei: There's no way I'd forget how amazing our first kiss was either. I can't really explain it well, but it was just... amazing. Kanna: That's not what I meant either, and you know it. Kousei: What? Are you saying that kiss meant nothing to you? Kanna: Of course not... It felt amazing for me too. More amazing than words can describe. Kousei: Right? Kanna: I'm so happy right now. Kousei: Me too. Kanna: But you haven't forgotten what you promised me, have you? Kousei: No. I remember. Kanna: Will you be able to keep your promise? Kousei: I'm not a kid. Of course I will. Kanna: I'm holding you to it. You'd better not forget. Kousei: I won't. Kanna: I want you to find your own happiness, for real this time. Kousei: What do you mean \"for real\"? I'm already happy right now. Kanna: I guess so. Nihihi. Kanna: ...... Kanna: You know something, Kousei-san? Kousei: Yeah? Kanna: I really love you. Kousei: I love you too, Kanna. Kousei: I love you. Kousei: I love you... Kousei: ...... Mikado: Kanna has departed now, I take it? Kousei: Yeah. I thought I'd come to tell you... but I guess you already knew. Mikado: Yes. I have known her for quite a long time, after all. Mikado: And she had already requested that I find another employee to fill in for her after her departure. Kousei: Ah. Kousei: ...... Kousei: I know this might be a bit late, but can I ask you something? Mikado: What? Kousei: Do you think I managed to make her happy? Kousei: Was she happy enough to overcome her past? Mikado: Well, you certainly made her happy enough to squeal with joy. In fact, she would not shut up about you. Mikado: At the very least, those were her true feelings. That much I can confirm. Kousei: Alright. Kousei: I know. Mikado: If fate permits it, however... you may end up meeting each other once again. Kousei: I can meet her again? Like, in the future? Mikado: Indeed. However, since she is going to be reborn, she will certainly end up younger than you... Kousei: ...... Mikado: It may even be possible for her to be reincarnated as your own daughter one day. Mikado: If that happens, I trust that you will shower her with love and make her happy. Kousei: My daughter? You're kidding... Kousei: I can't even begin to imagine that. Mikado: Quite understandable. Kousei: Well, anyway, that's all I came here to tell you. Mikado: Thank you. I appreciate it. Mikado: At any rate, you ought to rest for today. It will help to calm you down. Kousei: You say that... but I'm not sure it will. Mikado: I understand that it is hard, but still. Mikado: Like I said, this was for the sake of Kanna's happiness. You will simply have to accept that. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Brr... It's freezing. Kousei: ...... , Mikado: Is not about the carbonara, no. I shall leave that matter completely up to you. Kousei: Alright. I'll try preparing a few more dishes next week as an experiment. Maybe up the order limit to twenty-five. Kanna: Sounds good. Anyway, I'm sure you can guess why I've asked you two to stay behind. Mei: This is about my eye again, isn't it? Kanna: We just want to know how things are progressing, so this shouldn't take too much of your time. Has anything changed with your eye since we last spoke? Mei: No. I still don't know how to release my butterflies... Kanna: Not to worry. I'm certain you'll get there eventually. Mikado: Our main purpose in opening this cafe has always been to collect butterflies. Thanks to you, that task has been proceeding expeditiously. Mikado: Allow me to thank you for your hard work once again. We owe you our gratitude. Mei: A-All I'm doing is catching butterflies. I'd wouldn't exactly call that \"hard work\"... Mei: B-But either way, I'll continue to do my best to help! Mikado: Thank you. We appreciate it. Mei: ...... Mikado: But while I appreciate your efforts, I will not be transforming into a cat. Mei: Okay. I'm sorry. Kanna: Allow me to thank you as well, Takamine-san. Kousei: Huh? Why me? Kanna: While it was mere coincidence that brought you here to work with us, you've become an invaluable member of our team. Kanna: Many of our customers even come to our cafe specifically to eat your dishes now. Kanna: So thank you very much. You've been an incredible help to us all. Kousei: Well, I mean... this was all because of that \"problem\" I had with my soul in the first place... Kousei: But I'm glad you appreciate me. Honestly, this job has been pretty fulfilling for me too lately. Mikado: Indeed. It would appear your soul's condition has been greatly improving. Kanna: You can't let your guard down just yet, but as long as you keep heading in the right direction, you won't have anything to worry about. Kousei: Phew. That's a relief to hear. I owe it all to Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Huh? Kousei: Thanks for guiding me in the right direction. Mei: N-No, I didn't do anything. Kousei: You did. Thank you for everything. Mei: I-I... Mei: ...... Mei: U-Um, was there anything else you wanted to discuss? Kanna: No, I believe that's it. Mei: In that case, I've got something I need to do, so--! Mikado: Alright. Then we apologize for keeping you. Mei: That's okay! Anyway, I'll be going now! Kousei: Let me walk you-- Mei: Good night! Kousei: Huh? Kousei: Y-Yeah, I am... Kanna: Good night. Kousei: Yeah. Good night... Kousei: ...... Kousei: I should've known... Mei: Y-You're fine. Kousei: Freaking out? Mei: Y-Yeah... I... Um... Mei: ...... Mei: Oh, gosh... I'm so nervous... Mei: U-Umm... I think it would take too long to explain myself, so... h-here! Mei: Yes. It's... my Valentine's Day gift... to you. Kousei: Chocolate! Mei: Y-Yes. It's chocolate, and it's, um... handmade. Kousei: Handmade! Mei: Wow, you're really excited about this... Suzune-san taught me how to make it, so it should taste alright... I think. Kousei: Oh... Is that why you've been going home together lately? Mei: Yeah. I've been going to her apartment so she could teach me. Mei: She's also been helping me by asking you about your preferences and stuff... Kousei: My preferences? Oh, wait. Mei: Ahaha... Sorry. I guess I just felt kind of embarrassed... Kousei: Is that why the others said they weren't giving me any chocolate this year? So this would be a surprise? Mei: What? I don't know anything about that... Mei: But the others knew I was planning on giving you my own chocolate, so... I guess that could be why they did that... Kousei: Phew. I thought for sure you hated me or something... Mei: Wh-What?! Of course not! Why would you think that? Kousei: I mean, you've been avoiding me lately, haven't you? Mei: I-I wasn't... I mean... Well, maybe a little... Kousei: See? Mei: That's only because I didn't want you to find out I was preparing chocolate for you... Mei: But... I'm sorry for acting so weird. I didn't mean to give you the wrong idea. Kousei: It's alright. I've been really anxious these past few days, so it's a relief to know the truth. Mei: Urk... I'm sorry... Kousei: Handmade chocolate, though... This is more than I expected. Thank you. Mei: Um, if you'd like... you're welcome to go ahead and eat it... Kousei: Right now? Mei: Yeah. I actually brought you a fork too. Kousei: To be honest, I was planning to go home and savor it there... Mei: N-No, please! You can't! You can't keep me waiting that long! Mei: My heart's already pounding so fast it's about to explode! Mei: I need to know how you think it tastes right now... or else I'm going to die! Kousei: A-Alright. I'll have a bite... Mei: Please do! There are two inside, so at least try one of them! Right now! Mei: Something like that. It's called a chocolate fondant. Kousei: Sounds fancy. Was it hard to make? Mei: Not at all. Suzune-san was there to guide me through every single step. Mei: Ah, but just for the record--I made this all by myself! And I think I did a pretty good job! Mei: Though, um... it was a lot crispier on the outside when it came out of the oven, but it might be a bit soggy by now. Mei: But it shouldn't taste bad! This was Suzune-san's own personal recipe! I baked it with the utmost care! Mei: The flavor should be to your liking as well! So p-please, go ahead and try some! Kousei: Alright... don't mind if I do then. Mei: H-Help yourself! Kousei: ...... Mei: H-Hello? Kousei: ...... Mei: Senpai? Kousei: ...... Mei: Um... Does it... taste bad? Kousei: It's delicious. Mei: R-Really? Oh, thank goodness! Kousei: Oh god... It's so delicious... Mei: Wait, what? Huh? Kousei: How? How can something taste THIS good?! Mei: O-Oh, come on... You're exaggerating... Kousei: *sniffle*... Mei: Wait, are you crying? You're not pretending, are you? No way. Like, seriously? You're seriously crying? Kousei: I can't help it... Mei: O-Okay? Kousei: Everyone kept saying they wouldn't be giving me any chocolate... Mei: Oh... right. They said it'd be a hassle to get return gifts for everyone. Kousei: Even Nozomi, who usually gives me chocolates every year... gave me nothing. Mei: Wait, every year? Oh, right. You and Nozomi-chan are childhood friends. Kousei: Yeah, but she said she'd only been giving them to me out of force of habit... Mei: Oh... Err... I'm not sure what to say to that. Kousei: In the end, the only person who gave me chocolates was you... And handmade chocolate too... Kousei: Thank you... Thank you, Hiuchidani-san! Mei: I didn't think you'd be THIS emotional... but I'm glad you like it. Mei: But I can't say I was expecting you to start crying... It's a little, um, creepy. Kousei: Yeah, I know. I guess I tried too hard to sell it. Mei: Ah! I KNEW you were pretending, you stinker! Mei: Do you really mean that? Kousei: Yeah. I mean it. Seriously. Kousei: I could finish off both these chocolates right here if I'm not careful. Mei: Phew... Kousei: There's no way you could've gone wrong with Suzune-san's recipe. Mei: Yeah, but still... Kousei: Besides, even if it DID taste bad, I'd never say it to your face. Mei: What? So it really DOES taste bad?! Kousei: No, no. It's delicious. Really. Mei: *sigh*... My heart's pounding so much. Like, I've been feeling so anxious lately. That's why I've been acting so weird... Mei: When I was making the chocolate by hand, I began to understand how you feel, Senpai. Mei: Making food for someone else to eat is incredibly stressful and nerve-wracking... Mei: But it's also really fun, trying to make something that the person will like. Mei: And when you do get that confirmation from them that they like it... Mei: It makes you happier than words can describe! Kousei: I already told you. Why don't you believe me? Mei: Because I'm worried! Kousei: Didn't you taste it yourself beforehand? Mei: Well, yeah. I tried one I made from the same batch, but still... Kousei: It was delicious, wasn't it? Mei: It was, but this one's gone all cold! It's not FRESH! Kousei: Even so, it tastes delicious. Mei: Really? Really, really? Kousei: If you're really that worried about the taste, why don't you try some yourself? Kousei: See? I told you. Mei: Phew... Wait. Ah... Ahh! Kousei: What? Mei: Th-Th-Th-That was... an i-i-indirect k-ki--! Kousei: Oh, right. Sorry. You're pretty sensitive about these sorts of things, aren't you? Mei: O-O-Oh, no! It doesn't bothe--well... i-it does, I guess... Kousei: My bad. I totally forgot. Mei: I-I mean... As long as it's you, I... Mei: ...... Mei: U-U-Umm! Kousei: Hm? Mei: Suzune-san told me something... Kousei: Yeah? Mei: She said that you'd be happy receiving any kind of chocolate for Valentine's Day... Kousei: It's true. I'm pretty thrilled right now. Thank you, seriously. Mei: You're welcome... But she also said that... if I gave you handmade chocolate... Mei: Then... Umm... Kousei: Hm? Mei: Then you'd... umm! Kousei: Yeah? Mei: You'd think that... it meant I had genuine feelings for you... Kousei: O-Oh, come on! I can't believe she told you that too! Mei: Y-Yes... That's what she said... Kousei: I, er, I mean... I was only half-joking when I said that... Mei: You were... joking? Kousei: Y-Yeah. I was just messing with her... Kousei: B-But don't worry! I'm not dumb enough to think you like me just because of a couple chocolates! Mei: ...... Mei: I wouldn't mind... if you thought I did... though. Kousei: O-Okay? Kousei: ...... Kousei: Wait, what?! Mei: ...... Kousei: ...... Kousei: ...... Mei: Um... Mei: ...... Mei: During our girls' night out the other day... everyone kept asking me about that time we went to the pool together... Mei: Eventually, the conversation turned to... whether or not I had f-feelings for you, Senpai... Mei: I said I didn't know... but everyone else said it was obvious that I did... Mei: I thought they might be right... but I've never had any sort of romantic experience before... so I wasn't sure. Mei: I can't say I really understand my own feelings... but at the very least, I do know that you're a very important person to me. Mei: That's... what I wanted to tell you today. Mei: But... Mei: ...... Mei: Just now, I realized that... I really do... love you, Senpai. Mei: I mean, love is supposed to make your heart pound, isn't it? But when I'm with you, it's almost the opposite... I feel so relaxed that I thought it couldn't be love. Mei: But right now... my heart is pounding like crazy. Even though all I'm doing is telling you how I feel... my chest feels like it's about to burst. Mei: When I made up my mind to give you these chocolates... and when I decided to ask Suzune-san to teach me how to make them... Mei: While I practiced... This morning... During work... And while I was sitting here waiting for you earlier too... Mei: My heart wouldn't stop pounding. Mei: You wouldn't believe how nervous I felt. Mei: The truth is... I've had feelings for you all this time. Mei: So it's time I worked up the courage to say it. Mei: I... I think I love you, Senpai. Mei: No, wait... That doesn't sound right... Mei: ...... Mei: Senpai... I love you. Mei: I love the way you thank me, even when I've barely done anything... Mei: I love the way you're so nice to me, and lend an ear to all my worries... Mei: And I love so many other things about you too. Mei: So please... Mei: ...... Mei: Please... go out with me. Mei: Please... take me as your girlfriend. Mei: I... want to be with you from now on, Senpai. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Right now... my heart's also hammering like crazy. Kousei: When I thought you were avoiding me... it made me feel so lonely and so worried. Kousei: I was afraid you didn't like me, and I became really depressed. Kousei: Especially when you ran off without giving me any chocolate. Kousei: But then--you messaged to ask if we could meet. My heart wouldn't stop pounding on the way here. Kousei: This whole day's been a roller coaster of emotions for me. Kousei: But if what I'm feeling is the same thing you are... then I'm in love too. Kousei: In love with you, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Ah... Urk... Kousei: I love you too, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: S-So... Kousei: I want you to go out with me. Mei: ...... Mei: Ahhh... Mei: I'm a total mess of emotions right now... Kousei: Me too... My face must be burning up right now. Mei: ...... Kousei: ...... Mei: ...... Kousei: Uh... if you don't mind... Mei: Huh? Kousei: Could I call you by your first name? It'd feel oddly formal... if I kept using your last name. Mei: Y-Yeah, I agree... Go ahead. You don't have to use an honorific either... if you don't want. Kousei: Oh... Mei: Yeah. You can just call me Mei. Kousei: M... M-M-M... Mei: You're stammering so much... Kousei: I-I can't help it. I've never called you this before... Mei: That's fine. I can be patient. Kousei: M-Mei... Mei: There you go. Ehehe... Kousei: What about you? Mei: Huh? Kousei: Will you start calling me by my name? Mei: Senpai? Kousei: That's not what it says on my birth certificate. Mei: Urk... Mei: ...... Mei: Kousei... san? Kousei: You can drop the honorific too. Mei: Well... I mean, I'm younger than you, so... Mei: But maybe I could call you Kou-kun instead-- Mei: No, wait. That's even more embarrassing. Kousei: Yeah... That's pretty embarrassing for me too. Mei: Well, for now... I'm only going to use your first name when we're alone together. Kousei: A-Alright. I guess we wouldn't want the others to tease us about it. Mei: E-Exactly. Kousei: ...... Mei: ...... Kousei: Y-Yeah. I mean, if that's okay with you... Mei: O-Of course it is! Mei: ......

Kanna: I need a Guatemalan and Darjeeling for table four, as well as a slice of sachertorte. Natsume: Got it. Kanna: Order coming in! One plate of pancakes for table four, please. Kousei: Alright. Kousei: The carbonara for table two is ready, by the way. Kanna: I'll take that out. Kousei: You too. Kousei: What's degenerate about that? Every healthy young man has those kinds of thoughts. Kanna: I question that. Your fetishes are definitely not normal. Kousei: Well, I'm sorry that your thighs are just that enticing. Take it as a compliment. Kanna: That's not a very flattering compliment. Kousei: O-Oh. Well then. Kousei: You don't have to do that... but could you keep on stroking my head? Kanna: Like this? Nihihi. You really are a needy little boy, aren't you? Kousei: ...... Kousei: Kanna, if I may. Kanna: What is it? Kousei: I know I'm the one who asked you to stroke my head... but do you have to do it like that? Kanna: Well, shucks... I thought you'd appreciate that. Kanna: In that case... how about I tickle you this time instead? Coochy, coochy, coo! Kousei: Ah, hey, stop that! I'm ticklish! Kanna: That's good to know! Nihihi! Kousei: Ahhh?! Ah!

Kanna: Hnghh! Mikado: Is something the matter? Kanna: No, it's nothing serious. You want to know something, though, Mikado-san? Mikado: What? Kanna: Kisses feels amazing. Mikado: I beg your pardon? Kanna: You know, kissing. I had no idea it would make me feel so hot. Even though it's not my first time anymore... it's sho amazing... Mikado: You had me quite confused at first. Well, I am glad that your relationship seems to be going well... Mikado: But how were things? Kanna: It's strange. Even though all we're doing is putting our lips together... it makes my entire body go numb, making it hard to even breathe, plus my head goes completely blank-- Mikado: I was not asking you to describe your impressions of kissing. Kanna: Wait! I know what you're thinking, but we didn't use any tongue! That would virtually be foreplay, and we haven't had sex yet, so-- Mikado: I was not inquiring about any of that, you nymphomanic excuse of a Grim Reaper. Kanna: You really need to stop calling me that. Mikado: I was merely asking you how Takamine Kousei was doing. Mikado: But I think I have heard all I need to hear. Mikado: Given how giddy you yourself are, it is clear as day how Takamine Kousei must be feeling. Kanna: Ahaha... Is it that obvious? Mikado: If he truly does make you that happy, is that not all the more reason to go all the way with him? Kanna: I mean, sure... I bet it feels wonderful... having sex with someone you truly love. Kanna: At least, I'm sure it would for me. Mikado: But not for him? Kanna: I'm afraid. If I were to be his first, and then disappear soon after... Mikado: ...... Kanna: Oh, that reminds me. You should start looking for a new employee. Kanna: After the New Year's holiday, we're going to be one waitress short. Mikado: Ah... So the time you have remaining is that scant? Kanna: Yes. I want to make him happy, make him smile. But at the same time... I don't want him to have a lingering attachment to me that becomes a burden to him. Kanna: That's why the most I could give him was an ordinary kiss. Kanna: Truth be told, it may have been better if we never even did that. Kanna: But I really do love him, so I just couldn't help myself... Mikado: That was a part of it, I'm sure. Mikado: But you allowed him to kiss you because you saw no problem with it, did you not? Kanna: Yes. I hadn't realized it myself, but now that you mention it... you're probably right. Kanna: I'm certain that Kousei-san will be fine. Mikado: If you can say that with such confidence, then you have nothing to worry about. Mikado: Should you choose to keep him at arm's length... you may well end up leaving him with even more regrets. Kanna: I appreciate your advice. Mikado: I look forward to seeing you all next year. Have a good night, everyone. Mikado: Make sure not to catch a cold under the kotatsu tonight. Everyone: Happy New Year! Mei: What are you doing for the New Year's holiday, Nozomi-chan? Nozomi: Helping out at home, most likely. It's the busiest time of the year for us at the shrine. Mei: Oh, that's right! I'll definitely come by to visit the shrine for New Year's. I can't wait to see your adorable shrine maiden outfit! Nozomi: Oh, stop. You're embarrassing me... Natsume: Have you got any special plans, Suzune-san? Suzune: Nope. I think I'm just gonna hibernate at home till January. Kousei: Hm? Aren't you going to get changed? Kanna: I can always get changed in my own room. But first, I wanted to ask you about your holiday plans. Kousei: Sure. I wanted to ask you what you were doing too. Kousei: How do Grim Reapers usually spend their New Year's? Do you have to drop by heaven and say hello to God or something? Kanna: No, nothing like that. Kanna: Actually, I was hoping I could spend it with you. What do you say we go on another date tomorrow? Kanna: There's someplace I'd like to go. Kousei: Fine by me. In fact, I'd love to. Kousei: Where are we going? Kanna: That's... a secret for now. Kousei: It's a surprise, huh? Kanna: More or less. Kanna: Let's meet at noon here, at the cafe... Oh, and make sure you don't eat lunch beforehand. Kousei: Alright. Noon it is. Kanna: Indeed. Kousei: I can't wait to see what you have in store for tomorrow. Kanna: ...... Kanna: You bet. I'll see you tomorrow. ",
            "Natsume: Hey. Mei: How's Kousei-senpai doing? Kanna: He seemed fine. He had a decent appetite, and his temperature was normal too. Suzune: Phew. That's good to hear. Kanna: Thank you for lending me your key, Nozomi-san. Nozomi: You're welcome. I was feeling pretty worried myself; Kousei-kun rarely gets so sick that he has to stay at home. Mei: Really? Nozomi: He always seems relatively healthy, doesn't he? Nozomi: As far back as I can remember, he's never come down with anything worse than a light cold. His immune system must be pretty strong. Suzune: Hmm. So I guess even people like him aren't invincible? Kanna: It is winter, after all. Perhaps he let his guard down a little too much. Kanna: But I'm sure he'll be fit as a fiddle by tomorrow. Mikado: Well then, now that our worries have been laid to rest, let us get back to cleaning up. Nozomi & Mei: Okaay. Mikado: So. Mikado: How was Takamine Kousei truly doing? Kanna: As we feared, his soul had weakened considerably. Mikado: I assume you treated him accordingly? Kanna: Yes, of course. In order to return his weakened soul to normal, I poured my energy into-- Kanna: I mean, that is to say... Kanna: ...... Kanna: I did what had to be done. Mikado: That is quite the vague way of putting it. Kanna: Pay me no mind. Mikado: ...... Mikado: Come to think of it, I believe that you have to physically touch someone in order to transfer your energy to them. Kanna: Yes... that you do. Mikado: And furthermore, it cannot be a simple holding of the hands. It has to be a more intimate method of contact, if I recall. Kanna: ...... Mikado: Did you have sexual intercourse with him, by chance? Kanna: Of course not! Where on earth did that come from?! Mikado: You were acting quite odd, so I thought perhaps that was why... Kanna: Excuse you? What, did you think that instead of pouring my energy into him, he poured his essence into ME?! Kanna: You're so vulgar, Mikado-san. Mikado: That is simply your own filthy mind clouding your judgment, you nymphomanic excuse of a Grim Reaper. Kanna: Please never call me that ever again. Mikado: Still, something happened, no? You have a terrible poker face when it comes to hiding your own secrets. Kanna: Nothing happened. I just... put my forehead against his. Mikado: Hmm. Nothing too strange, I suppose. Kanna: The idea seemed fine to me at first, since it's something a parent might do for their child... Kanna: But once I actually did it, I started feeling incredibly embarrassed for some reason... and my heart began pounding like crazy... Kanna: Then I started babbling nonsense, shouting sex this, sex that. Mikado: Now you have lost me. Kanna: (Maybe it's because I did something I've never experienced before. Something I wasn't used to...) Kanna: (Maybe that's why it makes my heart race just thinking back on it.) Kanna: (In fact... Ever since I met Takamine-san, I've been feeling my heart race quite often.) Kanna: (But it goes beyond just that.) Kanna: (We've also had lots of fun chatting about silly things, phone shopping, eating yakiniku with everyone, and taking lots of pictures.) Kanna: (Enjoyable memories that don't just make my heart race, but also bring a smile to my face.) Kanna: (When did I begin to actively want to do those things with others...) Kanna: (And whenever the thought crosses my mind--) Kanna: (I naturally picture Takamine-san there as well.) Mikado: ...... Kanna: Oh! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to get lost in thought. Mikado: In any case, is it safe to say that the matter with Takamine Kousei's weakened soul has been resolved? Kanna: Yes. I believe he should be up and about by tomorrow. Mikado: And what about you? Are you... Mikado: ...... Mikado: Never mind. Forget it. Mikado: At any rate, even assuming Takamine Kousei feels well enough to return to work tomorrow, I suggest you keep a close eye on him. Kanna: Tomorrow... Mikado: Is something the matter? Kanna: No, it's nothing. Kanna: (Is it... normal that I can't wait to see him back at work tomorrow?) Kousei: Hmm? Child: Forgive me... I'm sorry, I'm sorry... Kousei: What a weird dream, though. Kousei: Why are you whispering like you're filming a prank video? Nozomi: Huh? You're already awake, Kousei-kun? How are you feeling? Kousei: I feel fine. Great, even. Kousei: What are you doing here so early, though? Nozomi: I came to see how you were doing, duh. Kousei: I appreciate the concern, but I'm all better now. Couldn't be better, in fact. Nozomi: Are you planning to go to work today? Kousei: Yep. With the way I'm feeling, I shouldn't need to play it safe. Nozomi: Hmm... Let me see. Nozomi: I've got some breakfast prepared for you, so why don't we eat together? You are hungry, aren't you? Kousei: Absolutely. But if you're only gonna start cooking now, I might end up late for work. Nozomi: Worry not, Kousei-kun. It's just last night's leftovers. Nozomi: I was worried you might not have an appetite, so I packed everything into these Tupperware containers in case you needed to keep them in the fridge for a while. Kousei: Man, you're the perfect girl, Nozomi. Nozomi: Ehehe! Your praise is greatly appreciated. Nozomi: Oh, that reminds me. I'm sure everybody's worried about you, so let them know you're back on your feet, okay? Kousei: Good idea. Suzune: Mhh, tastes fine. Thanks. Kousei: Alright. I'll get to work on the next batch. Kanna: Good morning, you guys! Kousei: Ah! Suzune: Hey there, Kanna-san. Kousei: O-Oh, uh... hi, Akizuki-san. Kanna: Having naughty thoughts first thing in the morning again, are we? My goodness. Nihihi! Kanna: (Calm down, Kanna! Just calm down! Do not panic!) Kanna: (If Takamine-san sees me like this, he's going to get the wrong idea.) Kanna: (I'm a Grim Reaper. It would cause nothing but trouble if I were to lead him on like that... Alright.) Kanna: Ahem. Good morning, Takamine-san. Kousei: Yeah. Good morning. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Huh? O-Oh. Sorry. Kanna: Takamine-san... You weren't having any weird fantasies again, were you? Kousei: Hahaha. Don't be ridiculous. Kanna: You're acting awfully suspicious. Kousei: I mean, can you blame me after what we did yesterday? Kousei: Easier said than done... Kousei: The more you tell me not to worry about it, the harder it is to actually do. Kanna: I understand that, but still... Kousei: ...... Kanna: ...... Suzune: *stare* Kousei: Er... Could you please stop staring at us? Suzune: Stop making me out to be the bad guy here. Suzune: Something happen yesterday between you two? You mentioned feeling awkward. Suzune: Don't tell me that \"visit\" was just an excuse for you two to get it on or something? Kanna: We did nothing of the sort! I only went to check up on him! It was just a normal visit!  Kousei: What?! THAT was normal for you? It was my first time... *blush*... Kanna: Don't test me! Kousei: Sorry, sorry. Bad joke. Kousei: Anyway, it's not what you're thinking. All she did was cook me omelet rice. Kousei: But enough about that. Let's get back to work. We've gotta hurry or we won't make in time for opening. Suzune: Well, whatever. As long as it doesn't impact your work. Kanna: I'd better start getting the dining floor ready too. Kanna: By the way, Takamine-san. Would you come see me later when you have some time? There's something I'd like to check with you. Kousei: Alright, sure... Suzune: Hmm... I'm not sure you'll have the time. You need to get to class soon, don't you? Kousei: Oh, right. I didn't realize the time. Suzune: Go on. Get outta here before you're late. Kousei: Alright. Just let me finish up here before I leave. Kousei: Okay. Let's get going. Kanna: Takamine-san? Thank goodness I caught you before you left. Kousei: Are you taking a break? Or is there some kind of problem? Kanna: Did you forget what I told you this morning? I wanted to check something with you. Kousei: Oh, right... Sorry. I was so focused on work that I totally forgot. Kousei: You want to check on my soul, right? Kanna: Yes. I want make sure everything's okay, just to be safe. Kousei: So, uh... are we gonna do the forehead thing again? Kanna: Yes... we are. Otherwise I won't be able to tell. Kanna: But don't worry. I won't make a fool of myself like yesterday. I've calmed down a bit since last night, so I promise not to go shouting about sex and whatnot again. Kanna: I can't guarantee I won't get embarrassed, though... Kousei: Well, as long as you're fine with it, I don't mind. Kousei: In fact, this is my life and health we're talking about here. I should be begging you to do it. Kousei: Thanks. And sorry for making you deal with my problems all the time. Kanna: Oh, don't worry about that. It has always been my job to look after your well-being, after all... And besides, I'm rather enjoying myself. Kousei: You are? Kanna: Yeah. It's kind of like... all this time, I've done nothing except guiding the souls of the dead, performing my duties as a Grim Reaper. Kanna: Not to say I dislike my job as Grim Reaper, though. I think it's a very important responsibility. Kousei: Ah... I guess I understand where you're coming from. Kanna: Not to mention phone shopping, eating yakiniku, and taking pictures of everyday things. Kanna: But all of it has been incredibly fun. Kanna: So please, don't hesitate to let me know if you ever need something. It doesn't have to be anything Grim Reaper-related either. I'll be happy just to hear from you. Kousei: Alright. Kanna: O-Oh, goodness! I didn't mean to prattle on for so long! I'm not going to make you late for class, am I? Kousei: Nah, I'm fine. I've still got another ten minutes to spare. Kousei: ...... Kousei: I can't believe how sensitive I am. It's gross. Hiroto: What are you talking to yourself about? Hiroto: Is your head still not working right? Kousei: Hmm... You're not exactly wrong. Kousei: But I'm not sick like I was yesterday. Natsume: Really? Well, that's good. Hiroto: Ahh! G-God, you scared me. Kousei: Shiki-san? How long have you been standing there? Natsume: I just got here. I'm glad to hear you're feeling better. Kousei: Thanks. Natsume: What's wrong with you today, though? Kousei: I don't know if there's something wrong with me, per se... Kousei: Well... Hiroto: Then what? Spit it out already. Kousei: I think there's... a girl that I like. Natsume: Whoa, really? Who is it? You have to tell me. Hiroto: Didn't expect you of all people to be so curious about something like this, Shiki-san. Natsume: Oh, shoot. I'd like to hear more, but I'm going to be late for class... Natsume: Can we meet up again after class? I want to hear all the juicy details about this. Hiroto: Good idea. We should find a quieter place and time for this. Kousei: We've gotta get back to the cafe after class, though. Natsume: We can spare a little bit of time, surely. I'll call ahead to let the others know. Kousei: Yeah, sort of. Natsume: Oh-ho. Let me take a guess then... Is it Akizuki-san? Kousei: You knew? Natsume: Well, by process of elimination, it had to be her. Hiroto: Akizuki-san... Isn't she that girl you went phone shopping with? Hiroto: I mean, she is pretty attractive... I'm not surprised you have a crush on her. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Ahhhhhh! Hiroto: Why are you squirming around all of a sudden? Kousei: I dunno. But just thinking about her makes my heart race... Natsume: What are you, a teenage girl? Hiroto: I won't lie, you're acting kinda creepy. Kousei: It's not my fault. This is the first time I've ever felt this way... Natsume: Again, that's a textbook teenage-girl-in-love line. Hiroto: Stop blushing like that. It ain't cute. Kousei: Trust me, nobody's more surprised about this than I am. I never imagined I'd fall head over heels for someone like this, the way they do in manga. Kousei: This... must be what true love feels like. Hiroto: Kousei... Hiroto: Urgh! I can't believe you actually just said that! I'm gonna fucking die of cringe! Kousei: Shuddup! Natsume: Don't tease him. I know it sounds cringey, but his feelings are genuine. Natsume: I'm getting second-hand embarrassment just from listening to this too, but remember, his feelings are genuine. Kousei: You're teasing me just as much as he is. Hiroto: So? You gonna ask her out? Kousei: Nah, it's way too soon for that. Hiroto: But you should probably make some kinda move. Even Nonaka-kun's putting himself out there. Kousei: I mean, sure... but it could affect our work relationship from now on... Hiroto: Maybe, but if you let that stop you, you're never gonna get anywhere. Hiroto: If all you do is make excuses, your relationship's gonna stay the same forever. Kousei: I mean, I get that, but still... Natsume: Instead of confessing to her out of the blue, why don't you ask her out on a date first? Hiroto: Oh, yeah! You can go on a date for Christmas! Kousei: But we're selling our limited-edition Yule Logs on Christmas day. Kousei: Even now, I'm being forced to spend my free time practicing making them over and over until Suzune-san's satisfied. Kousei: I'll probably be spending the entire day on Christmas rolling those cakes into logs... I hope I don't get tendinitis. Natsume: Well, what about tomorrow then? The cafe's going to be closed, so you won't have to worry about work. Hiroto: Just ask her out, man. Kousei: H-Hrmm... Hiroto: Sheesh. Grow a pair, will you? Kousei: I mean, you can't just spring this on me all of a sudden... I don't even have time to come up with a plan. Natsume: You'll be fine; it's the holiday season. As long as you go someplace where you can see Christmas lights, it'll seem like a proper date. Hiroto: Still, it's better to decide these sorts of things sooner rather than later. Hiroto: For reference, what kind of Christmas date would you want to go on, as the girl here, Shiki-san? Natsume: I wouldn't want to go out. Too many people. Hiroto: So you'd prefer a stay-at-home date? Natsume: Honestly, just because it's Christmas doesn't mean you absolutely have to go on a date. Hiroto: Not a big fan of the holidays, are you? Natsume: If you ask me, guys are the ones who put too much importance on the holidays. Natsume: Dealing with huge crowds and long lines is nothing but stress. Hardly my idea of a fun date. Hiroto: I mean, yeah, but Christmas only comes once a year. Kousei: What do you suggest then, Hiroto? Hiroto: Me? Hmm... Oh, fine. Hiroto: I was actually going to use this myself... but I'll let you in on my special date plan. Kousei: Ohh! That'd be awesome! Hiroto: The key is to be romantic. And surprises are important too. Kousei: Right. Hiroto: And when it comes to Christmas dates--presents are an absolute must. Jewelry would be a good choice. Hiroto: But wait! I know what you're thinking. An ordinary gift like that isn't going to win any hearts. Hiroto: That's why it's critical to pick something that conveys your true feelings. Kousei: What kind of jewelry, specifically? Hiroto: Why, a necklace that spells out the word \"love,\" of course! Apparently, a ton of places even do custom-made orders these days! Hiroto: It's the ultimate heartfelt Christmas present that combines both romance and surprise! Genius, isn't it?! Natsume: You're a freak. Hiroto: What the hell was that for?! Natsume: If someone gave me a love necklace for Christmas, I'd be pretty turned off. Hiroto: Surely giving a girl such a unique and memorable gift would increase your chances of success when confessing to her, though. Natsume: Why would you ever think that? Natsume: Unless that girl is a rapper, or the famous samurai Naoe Kanetsugu, I doubt they'd want a necklace like that. Hiroto: That's not true! The most widely accepted theory is that Naoe Kanetsugu's armor was decorated with the character for \"love\" in tribute to the Buddhist deity of martial arts, not because-- Natsume: Nobody cares. Hiroto: F-Fine! Then how about city-gazing?! Like, at night! Hiroto: Walking around looking at Christmas lights isn't a bad idea either, but for a fashionable girl who doesn't wear sneakers, that might take a bit of a toll on her feet! Natsume: That's pretty considerate of you, actually. Hiroto: So here's what you do. You book a room at some high-class hotel, then as the two of you are gazing out at the city lights, you come up and hug her gently from behind. Natsume: Why would he book a hotel for them? They're not even dating. Hiroto: Finally, for the finishing blow, you whisper into her ear, \"Let's show this city what our love looks like.\" Natsume: God, I think I'm going to puke. Hiroto: It's foolproof! Whaddaya think?! Natsume: That's just plain disgusting! Are you completely incapable of coming up with any normal ideas? Hiroto: But he's gonna wanna show her that he's not like other guys! Natsume: Yes, in a GOOD way! Not by showing her that he's a disgusting creep! Natsume: Are you even listening to yourself? Cut it out before you make him do something he'll regret! Kousei: I think I'm starting to see why you're not very popular with girls. Hiroto: The hell'd you say?! Kousei: I doubt you even know how to ask a girl out period. Hiroto: Excuse you. I know perfectly well how. Hiroto: \"Hey, how's it goin'? So, listen. I know this is kinda random, but do you want to go eat somewhere with me? I know this great place. I was actually planning to go with my friends, but they canceled on me last minute.\" Hiroto: See? Piece of cake. Kousei: Let's turn to our commentator, Shiki Natsume, for a reaction. Natsume: That was atrocious. Hiroto: That was WAY too brutal! Natsume: I think you ought to reconsider your approach a little more. Hiroto: Urk. I've been told that before... Natsume: You don't need some lame excuse to ask a girl on a date. Just be upfront about what you want to do, and when you want to do it. Natsume: If you want to pull out this \"special plan\" of yours, at least save it for AFTER you've started dating... Not that it'd be any less gross then, but still. Hiroto: I'll keep that in mind. Natsume: That goes for you too, Takamine-kun. Don't try too hard. Just pick an activity you're comfortable with. Kousei: Hmm. Natsume: Maybe take her to a movie, or go window shopping. Just something ordinary. The important thing is to keep the mood enjoyable. Natsume: As long as you can do that, your relationship will naturally progress beyond being mere friends. Natsume: It won't be too late to do something special for her later on, if you feel like your relationship is starting to get into a rut. Hiroto & Kousei: Whoa... Hiroto: That's the Solitary Sniper for you. She's got way more experience with dating than we do, that's for sure. Natsume: ...... Hiroto: Oops. Sorry for calling you that. Natsume: It's okay. I know that's what people call me. But to be honest... Natsume: Despite everything I said, I don't actually have a lot of relationship experience... None at all, in fact. So take my advice with a grain of salt. Kousei: Still, I appreciate being able to get some sensible input from a real girl. Kousei: And thank you too, Hiroto. You've been a big help too. Hiroto: What, by being a bad example to learn from? Is that what you're trying to say? Kousei: No, I'm serious. Thanks for hearing me out. Kousei: If I had to deal with this myself, I might've done something really stupid. Natsume: Seriously? Kousei: My heart feels so warm. Kousei: It's been really hard to deal with lately. I can't seem to calm down whenever I look at Akizuki-san. Kousei: I want to talk with her about something--anything. I want to spend more time together with her. Natsume: You really are a teenage girl. Hiroto: He's down bad, that's for sure. Kousei: Anyway, my chest feels a bit lighter now. Thanks, you guys. Hiroto: If there's anything else you need, let me know anytime. Kousei: Just out of curiosity... What kind of Christmas present would you give a girl, Hiroto? Hiroto: I'd give her an engagement ring! No shit! An insanely expensive brand-name one! Combined with an intimate handwritten letter! Natsume: What did I just say about taking things slow?! Kousei: I can't let my nerves get to me. Kousei: Deep breaths, Kousei. Be natural. Be casual. Kousei: If I can manage that, I'll be fine. Yeah. Kousei: Hey, Suzune-san. I'm back from class. Suzune: Hey there. Kousei: Any orders I can work on? Suzune: I was just about to get started on these two plates of pancakes. Kousei: Let me handle them. You go ahead and take your break. Suzune: You sure? Well, okay. Give me a shout if you need anything. Kousei: Will do. Kousei: Now then. Kanna: Coming! Kousei: Ah! Kousei: Yeah, I'm back. Kousei: I'm feeling fine too, by the way. Suzune-san's on break right now, so I just finished up these pancakes for her. Kanna: That's great. Well, I'd better carry these out before they get cold. Kousei: Sure. Kousei: Before you go, though... Kousei: Er, never mind. Be careful not to trip and fall. Kanna: I won't do that. I'm not a child. Kousei: ...... Kousei: I shouldn't be asking her out while we're on the job. That'd be a distraction. Kousei: There's still time. I have plenty of chances to ask her out today! Kousei: And just like that, the day's over. Kousei: Guess I'll get changed. Kanna: Takamine-san? Do you have a minute? Kousei: Huh? Kanna: You seemed to be acting somewhat strange today. Are you alright? Kanna: Hmm... It doesn't seem as if there's anything wrong with your soul. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Well... that's because... Kousei: ...... Kanna: Tomorrow's our day off, isn't it? I don't have anything particular planned. Kousei: In that case, would you mind coming with me somewhere? There's someplace I want to go. Kanna: Where would that be? Kousei: I'll... have to tell you later. Kousei: But I want you to come with me. Kanna: Oh... okay then. I'll go with you. Kanna: Ah--is that why you were acting so funny the whole day? Kousei: I was trying to find the right moment to ask. Kanna: Oh, silly. You could've asked me that anytime. Kousei: I guess... I just didn't want to bother you while you were working and stuff, so... Kousei: A-Anyway, thank you. I'll see you tomorrow. Kanna: Right. I'm looking forward to it. Kousei: Great. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go outside...  Kanna: Huh? But you haven't finished changing yet. Kousei: Yeah, I know. I just need to step outside for a minute. Don't worry, I'll be right back. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Ngh... Kousei: Let's goooooooooo! I did it! Kousei: I was freaking out like crazy... Kousei: But... she said yes. Kanna: So that's the gist of it. You don't have any problem with us going out tomorrow, do you? Mikado: Hmm... You are free to do as you please, of course. Mikado: But I daresay that sounds like a date to me. Kanna: Huh? In what way? Mikado: The two of you are going out together, just the two of you. Kanna: Yeah... but we were alone that time we went out to buy me a phone too. Mikado: Be that as it may, tomorrow is the so-called Eve of Christmas Eve. Kanna: I mean, I suppose it is... Mikado: Since the cafe is open on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, neither of you would be able to take the day off work. Mikado: Do you not think that is why he chose tomorrow specifically, the 23rd, to ask you out? Kanna: You're reading too much into it. It's just a coincidence that the date happened to align like that. Mikado: Well, don't say I did not warn you. Kanna: It's not like that. I'm sure he simply wants to hang out as friends. Kanna: Besides, I'm a Grim Reaper. Takamine-san knows that full well. Mikado: I hope that he does. Kanna: You worry too much, Mikado-san. He doesn't think of me like th-- Kanna: ...... Mikado: ...... Kanna: W-We should be getting to bed. Mikado: Indeed. Whatever Takamine Kousei is thinking, we have no way of knowing. We may as well go to sleep. Kanna: (A date on the Eve of Christmas Eve? Takamine-san asking me out on a date? He'd never! Haha!) Kanna: (I know it SOUNDS like a date, but it's not.) Kanna: (He just needs my help with something.) "

We have to take a picture first! Miyu: Aww... Kanna: Now, now. No frowning. Give me a big, wide smile. Kanna: If you don't, you know what's going to happen! Tickle, tickle, tickle! Miyu: Ahaha! Mommy, that tickles! Kanna: Come on, sweetie. Smile, smile! Miyu: I am smiling! Ahaha! Kousei: Look this way, Miyu. Kanna: Tickle, tickle, tickle! Miyu: Mooommy! I said it tickles! Kanna: Come on, look at the camera. Kousei: Happy birthday, Miyu. Kanna: Happy birthday! Miyu: Thanks! Ehehe. , Kanna: Guatemalan coffee with a sachertorte, and a Darjeeling with pancakes. Alright. I'll have those out to you shortly. Kanna: I need a Guatemalan and Darjeeling for table four, as well as a slice of sachertorte. Natsume: Got it. Kanna: Order coming in! One plate of pancakes for table four, please. Kousei: Alright. Kousei: The carbonara for table two is ready, by the way. Kanna: I'll take that out. Kousei: You too. Kousei: What's degenerate about that? Every healthy young man has those kinds of thoughts. Kanna: I question that. Your fetishes are definitely not normal. Kousei: Well, I'm sorry that your thighs are just that enticing. Take it as a compliment. Kanna: That's not a very flattering compliment. Kousei: O-Oh. Well then. Kousei: You don't have to do that... but could you keep on stroking my head? Kanna: Like this? Nihihi. You really are a needy little boy, aren't you? Kousei: ...... Kousei: Kanna, if I may. Kanna: What is it? Kousei: I know I'm the one who asked you to stroke my head... but do you have to do it like that? Kanna: Well, shucks... I thought you'd appreciate that. Kanna: In that case... how about I tickle you this time instead? Coochy, coochy, coo! Kousei: Ah, hey, stop that! I'm ticklish! Kanna: That's good to know! Nihihi! Kousei: Ahhh?! Ah! Fine, let's see how YOU like it! Kanna: Ah! Ah, ahh! Ah, ah! Nhhhh! Kousei: Nh, nhh... Kanna: Ahh! *pant*... Kousei: Y-Yeah. Kousei: I'll see you tomorrow. Kanna: See you tomorrow. Kanna: ...... Kanna: Hnghh! Mikado: Is something the matter? Kanna: No, it's nothing serious. You want to know something, though, Mikado-san? Mikado: What? Kanna: Kisses feels amazing. Mikado: I beg your pardon? Kanna: You know, kissing. I had no idea it would make me feel so hot. Even though it's not my first time anymore... it's sho amazing... Mikado: You had me quite confused at first. Well, I am glad that your relationship seems to be going well... Mikado: But how were things? Kanna: It's strange. Even though all we're doing is putting our lips together... it makes my entire body go numb, making it hard to even breathe, plus my head goes completely blank-- Mikado: I was not asking you to describe your impressions of kissing. Kanna: Wait! I know what you're thinking, but we didn't use any tongue! That would virtually be foreplay, and we haven't had sex yet, so-- Mikado: I was not inquiring about any of that, you nymphomanic excuse of a Grim Reaper. Kanna: You really need to stop calling me that. Mikado: I was merely asking you how Takamine Kousei was doing. Mikado: But I think I have heard all I need to hear. Mikado: Given how giddy you yourself are, it is clear as day how Takamine Kousei must be feeling. Kanna: Ahaha... Is it that obvious? Mikado: If he truly does make you that happy, is that not all the more reason to go all the way with him? Kanna: I mean, sure... I bet it feels wonderful... having sex with someone you truly love. Kanna: At least, I'm sure it would for me. Mikado: But not for him? Kanna: I'm afraid. If I were to be his first, and then disappear soon after... Mikado: ...... Kanna: Oh, that reminds me. You should start looking for a new employee. Kanna: After the New Year's holiday, we're going to be one waitress short. Mikado: Ah... So the time you have remaining is that scant? Kanna: Yes. I want to make him happy, make him smile. But at the same time... I don't want him to have a lingering attachment to me that becomes a burden to him. Kanna: That's why the most I could give him was an ordinary kiss. Kanna: Truth be told, it may have been better if we never even did that. Kanna: But I really do love him, so I just couldn't help myself... Mikado: That was a part of it, I'm sure. Mikado: But you allowed him to kiss you because you saw no problem with it, did you not? Kanna: Yes. I hadn't realized it myself, but now that you mention it... you're probably right. Kanna: I'm certain that Kousei-san will be fine. Mikado: If you can say that with such confidence, then you have nothing to worry about. Mikado: Should you choose to keep him at arm's length... you may well end up leaving him with even more regrets. Kanna: I appreciate your advice. Mikado: I look forward to seeing you all next year. Have a good night, everyone. Mikado: Make sure not to catch a cold under the kotatsu tonight. Everyone: Happy New Year! Mei: What are you doing for the New Year's holiday, Nozomi-chan? Nozomi: Helping out at home, most likely. It's the busiest time of the year for us at the shrine. Mei: Oh, that's right! I'll definitely come by to visit the shrine for New Year's. I can't wait to see your adorable shrine maiden outfit! Nozomi: Oh, stop. You're embarrassing me... Natsume: Have you got any special plans, Suzune-san? Suzune: Nope. I think I'm just gonna hibernate at home till January. Kousei: Hm? Aren't you going to get changed? Kanna: I can always get changed in my own room. But first, I wanted to ask you about your holiday plans. Kousei: Sure. I wanted to ask you what you were doing too. Kousei: How do Grim Reapers usually spend their New Year's? Do you have to drop by heaven and say hello to God or something? Kanna: No, nothing like that. Kanna: Actually, I was hoping I could spend it with you. What do you say we go on another date tomorrow? Kanna: There's someplace I'd like to go. Kousei: Fine by me. In fact, I'd love to. Kousei: Where are we going? Kanna: That's... a secret for now. Kousei: It's a surprise, huh? Kanna: More or less. Kanna: Let's meet at noon here, at the cafe... Oh, and make sure you don't eat lunch beforehand. Kousei: Alright. Noon it is. Kanna: Indeed. Kousei: I can't wait to see what you have in store for tomorrow. Kanna: ...... Kanna: You bet. I'll see you tomorrow. , Natsume: Hey. Mei: How's Kousei-senpai doing? Kanna: He seemed fine. He had a decent appetite, and his temperature was normal too. Suzune: Phew. That's good to hear. Kanna: Thank you for lending me your key, Nozomi-san. Nozomi: You're welcome. I was feeling pretty worried myself; Kousei-kun rarely gets so sick that he has to stay at home. Mei: Really? Nozomi: He always seems relatively healthy, doesn't he? Nozomi: As far back as I can remember, he's never come down with anything worse than a light cold. His immune system must be pretty strong. Suzune: Hmm. So I guess even people like him aren't invincible? Kanna: It is winter, after all. Perhaps he let his guard down a little too much. Kanna: But I'm sure he'll be fit as a fiddle by tomorrow. Mikado: Well then, now that our worries have been laid to rest, let us get back to cleaning up. Nozomi & Mei: Okaay. Mikado: So. Mikado: How was Takamine Kousei truly doing? Kanna: As we feared, his soul had weakened considerably. Mikado: I assume you treated him accordingly? Kanna: Yes, of course. In order to return his weakened soul to normal, I poured my energy into-- Kanna: I mean, that is to say... Kanna: ...... Kanna: I did what had to be done. Mikado: That is quite the vague way of putting it. Kanna: Pay me no mind. Mikado: ...... Mikado: Come to think of it, I believe that you have to physically touch someone in order to transfer your energy to them. Kanna: Yes... that you do. Mikado: And furthermore, it cannot be a simple holding of the hands. It has to be a more intimate method of contact, if I recall. Kanna: ...... Mikado: Did you have sexual intercourse with him, by chance? Kanna: Of course not! Where on earth did that come from?! Mikado: You were acting quite odd, so I thought perhaps that was why... Kanna: Excuse you? What, did you think that instead of pouring my energy into him, he poured his essence into ME?! Kanna: You're so vulgar, Mikado-san. Mikado: That is simply your own filthy mind clouding your judgment, you nymphomanic excuse of a Grim Reaper. Kanna: Please never call me that ever again. Mikado: Still, something happened, no? You have a terrible poker face when it comes to hiding your own secrets. Kanna: Nothing happened. I just... put my forehead against his. Mikado: Hmm. Nothing too strange, I suppose. Kanna: The idea seemed fine to me at first, since it's something a parent might do for their child... Kanna: But once I actually did it, I started feeling incredibly embarrassed for some reason... and my heart began pounding like crazy... Kanna: Then I started babbling nonsense, shouting sex this, sex that. Mikado: Now you have lost me. Kanna: (Maybe it's because I did something I've never experienced before. Something I wasn't used to...) Kanna: (Maybe that's why it makes my heart race just thinking back on it.) Kanna: (In fact... Ever since I met Takamine-san, I've been feeling my heart race quite often.) Kanna: (But it goes beyond just that.) Kanna: (We've also had lots of fun chatting about silly things, phone shopping, eating yakiniku with everyone, and taking lots of pictures.) Kanna: (Enjoyable memories that don't just make my heart race, but also bring a smile to my face.) Kanna: (When did I begin to actively want to do those things with others...) Kanna: (And whenever the thought crosses my mind--) Kanna: (I naturally picture Takamine-san there as well.) Mikado: ...... Kanna: Oh! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to get lost in thought. Mikado: In any case, is it safe to say that the matter with Takamine Kousei's weakened soul has been resolved? Kanna: Yes. I believe he should be up and about by tomorrow. Mikado: And what about you? Are you... Mikado: ...... Mikado: Never mind. Forget it. Mikado: At any rate, even assuming Takamine Kousei feels well enough to return to work tomorrow, I suggest you keep a close eye on him. Kanna: Tomorrow... Mikado: Is something the matter? Kanna: No, it's nothing. Kanna: (Is it... normal that I can't wait to see him back at work tomorrow?) Kousei: Hmm? Child: Forgive me... I'm sorry, I'm sorry... Kousei: What a weird dream, though. Kousei: Why are you whispering like you're filming a prank video? Nozomi: Huh? You're already awake, Kousei-kun? How are you feeling? Kousei: I feel fine. Great, even. Kousei: What are you doing here so early, though? Nozomi: I came to see how you were doing, duh. Kousei: I appreciate the concern, but I'm all better now. Couldn't be better, in fact. Nozomi: Are you planning to go to work today? Kousei: Yep. With the way I'm feeling, I shouldn't need to play it safe. Nozomi: Hmm... Let me see. Nozomi: I've got some breakfast prepared for you, so why don't we eat together? You are hungry, aren't you? Kousei: Absolutely. But if you're only gonna start cooking now, I might end up late for work. Nozomi: Worry not, Kousei-kun. It's just last night's leftovers. Nozomi: I was worried you might not have an appetite, so I packed everything into these Tupperware containers in case you needed to keep them in the fridge for a while. Kousei: Man, you're the perfect girl, Nozomi. Nozomi: Ehehe! Your praise is greatly appreciated. Nozomi: Oh, that reminds me. I'm sure everybody's worried about you, so let them know you're back on your feet, okay? Kousei: Good idea. Suzune: Mhh, tastes fine. Thanks. Kousei: Alright. I'll get to work on the next batch. Kanna: Good morning, you guys! Kousei: Ah! Suzune: Hey there, Kanna-san. Kousei: O-Oh, uh... hi, Akizuki-san. Kanna: Having naughty thoughts first thing in the morning again, are we? My goodness. Nihihi! Kanna: (Calm down, Kanna! Just calm down! Do not panic!) Kanna: (If Takamine-san sees me like this, he's going to get the wrong idea.) Kanna: (I'm a Grim Reaper. It would cause nothing but trouble if I were to lead him on like that... Alright.) Kanna: Ahem. Good morning, Takamine-san. Kousei: Yeah. Good morning. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Huh? O-Oh. Sorry. Kanna: Takamine-san... You weren't having any weird fantasies again, were you? Kousei: Hahaha. Don't be ridiculous. Kanna: You're acting awfully suspicious. Kousei: I mean, can you blame me after what we did yesterday? Kousei: Easier said than done... Kousei: The more you tell me not to worry about it, the harder it is to actually do. Kanna: I understand that, but still... Kousei: ...... Kanna: ...... Suzune: *stare* Kousei: Er... Could you please stop staring at us? Suzune: Stop making me out to be the bad guy here. Suzune: Something happen yesterday between you two? You mentioned feeling awkward. Suzune: Don't tell me that \"visit\" was just an excuse for you two to get it on or something? Kanna: We did nothing of the sort! I only went to check up on him! It was just a normal visit!  Kousei: What?! THAT was normal for you? It was my first time... *blush*... Kanna: Don't test me! Kousei: Sorry, sorry. Bad joke. Kousei: Anyway, it's not what you're thinking. All she did was cook me omelet rice. Kousei: But enough about that. Let's get back to work. We've gotta hurry or we won't make in time for opening. Suzune: Well, whatever. As long as it doesn't impact your work. Kanna: I'd better start getting the dining floor ready too. Kanna: By the way, Takamine-san. Would you come see me later when you have some time? There's something I'd like to check with you. Kousei: Alright, sure... Suzune: Hmm... I'm not sure you'll have the time. You need to get to class soon, don't you? Kousei: Oh, right. I didn't realize the time. Suzune: Go on. Get outta here before you're late. Kousei: Alright. Just let me finish up here before I leave. Kousei: Okay. Let's get going. Kanna: Takamine-san? Thank goodness I caught you before you left. Kousei: Are you taking a break? Or is there some kind of problem? Kanna: Did you forget what I told you this morning? I wanted to check something with you. Kousei: Oh, right... Sorry. I was so focused on work that I totally forgot. Kousei: You want to check on my soul, right? Kanna: Yes. I want make sure everything's okay, just to be safe. Kousei: So, uh... are we gonna do the forehead thing again? Kanna: Yes... we are. Otherwise I won't be able to tell. Kanna: But don't worry. I won't make a fool of myself like yesterday. I've calmed down a bit since last night, so I promise not to go shouting about sex and whatnot again. Kanna: I can't guarantee I won't get embarrassed, though... Kousei: Well, as long as you're fine with it, I don't mind. Kousei: In fact, this is my life and health we're talking about here. I should be begging you to do it. Kousei: Thanks. And sorry for making you deal with my problems all the time. Kanna: Oh, don't worry about that. It has always been my job to look after your well-being, after all... And besides, I'm rather enjoying myself. Kousei: You are? Kanna: Yeah. It's kind of like... all this time, I've done nothing except guiding the souls of the dead, performing my duties as a Grim Reaper. Kanna: Not to say I dislike my job as Grim Reaper, though. I think it's a very important responsibility. Kousei: Ah... I guess I understand where you're coming from. Kanna: Not to mention phone shopping, eating yakiniku, and taking pictures of everyday things. Kanna: But all of it has been incredibly fun. Kanna: So please, don't hesitate to let me know if you ever need something. It doesn't have to be anything Grim Reaper-related either. I'll be happy just to hear from you. Kousei: Alright. Kanna: O-Oh, goodness! I didn't mean to prattle on for so long! I'm not going to make you late for class, am I? Kousei: Nah, I'm fine. I've still got another ten minutes to spare. Kousei: ...... Kousei: I can't believe how sensitive I am. It's gross. Hiroto: What are you talking to yourself about? Hiroto: Is your head still not working right? Kousei: Hmm... You're not exactly wrong. Kousei: But I'm not sick like I was yesterday. Natsume: Really? Well, that's good. Hiroto: Ahh! G-God, you scared me. Kousei: Shiki-san? How long have you been standing there? Natsume: I just got here. I'm glad to hear you're feeling better. Kousei: Thanks. Natsume: What's wrong with you today, though? Kousei: I don't know if there's something wrong with me, per se... Kousei: Well... Hiroto: Then what? Spit it out already. Kousei: I think there's... a girl that I like. Natsume: Whoa, really? Who is it? You have to tell me. Hiroto: Didn't expect you of all people to be so curious about something like this, Shiki-san. Natsume: Oh, shoot. I'd like to hear more, but I'm going to be late for class... Natsume: Can we meet up again after class? I want to hear all the juicy details about this. Hiroto: Good idea. We should find a quieter place and time for this. Kousei: We've gotta get back to the cafe after class, though. Natsume: We can spare a little bit of time, surely. I'll call ahead to let the others know. Kousei: Yeah, sort of. Natsume: Oh-ho. Let me take a guess then... Is it Akizuki-san? Kousei: You knew? Natsume: Well, by process of elimination, it had to be her. Hiroto: Akizuki-san... Isn't she that girl you went phone shopping with? Hiroto: I mean, she is pretty attractive... I'm not surprised you have a crush on her. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Ahhhhhh! Hiroto: Why are you squirming around all of a sudden? Kousei: I dunno. But just thinking about her makes my heart race... Natsume: What are you, a teenage girl? Hiroto: I won't lie, you're acting kinda creepy. Kousei: It's not my fault. This is the first time I've ever felt this way... Natsume: Again, that's a textbook teenage-girl-in-love line. Hiroto: Stop blushing like that. It ain't cute. Kousei: Trust me, nobody's more surprised about this than I am. I never imagined I'd fall head over heels for someone like this, the way they do in manga. Kousei: This... must be what true love feels like. Hiroto: Kousei... Hiroto: Urgh! I can't believe you actually just said that! I'm gonna fucking die of cringe! Kousei: Shuddup! Natsume: Don't tease him. I know it sounds cringey, but his feelings are genuine. Natsume: I'm getting second-hand embarrassment just from listening to this too, but remember, his feelings are genuine. Kousei: You're teasing me just as much as he is. Hiroto: So? You gonna ask her out? Kousei: Nah, it's way too soon for that. Hiroto: But you should probably make some kinda move. Even Nonaka-kun's putting himself out there. Kousei: I mean, sure... but it could affect our work relationship from now on... Hiroto: Maybe, but if you let that stop you, you're never gonna get anywhere. Hiroto: If all you do is make excuses, your relationship's gonna stay the same forever. Kousei: I mean, I get that, but still... Natsume: Instead of confessing to her out of the blue, why don't you ask her out on a date first? Hiroto: Oh, yeah! You can go on a date for Christmas! Kousei: But we're selling our limited-edition Yule Logs on Christmas day. Kousei: Even now, I'm being forced to spend my free time practicing making them over and over until Suzune-san's satisfied. Kousei: I'll probably be spending the entire day on Christmas rolling those cakes into logs... I hope I don't get tendinitis. Natsume: Well, what about tomorrow then? The cafe's going to be closed, so you won't have to worry about work. Hiroto: Just ask her out, man. Kousei: H-Hrmm... Hiroto: Sheesh. Grow a pair, will you? Kousei: I mean, you can't just spring this on me all of a sudden... I don't even have time to come up with a plan. Natsume: You'll be fine; it's the holiday season. As long as you go someplace where you can see Christmas lights, it'll seem like a proper date. Hiroto: Still, it's better to decide these sorts of things sooner rather than later. Hiroto: For reference, what kind of Christmas date would you want to go on, as the girl here, Shiki-san? Natsume: I wouldn't want to go out. Too many people. Hiroto: So you'd prefer a stay-at-home date? Natsume: Honestly, just because it's Christmas doesn't mean you absolutely have to go on a date. Hiroto: Not a big fan of the holidays, are you? Natsume: If you ask me, guys are the ones who put too much importance on the holidays. Natsume: Dealing with huge crowds and long lines is nothing but stress. Hardly my idea of a fun date. Hiroto: I mean, yeah, but Christmas only comes once a year. Kousei: What do you suggest then, Hiroto? Hiroto: Me? Hmm... Oh, fine. Hiroto: I was actually going to use this myself... but I'll let you in on my special date plan. Kousei: Ohh! That'd be awesome! Hiroto: The key is to be romantic. And surprises are important too. Kousei: Right. Hiroto: And when it comes to Christmas dates--presents are an absolute must. Jewelry would be a good choice. Hiroto: But wait! I know what you're thinking. An ordinary gift like that isn't going to win any hearts. Hiroto: That's why it's critical to pick something that conveys your true feelings. Kousei: What kind of jewelry, specifically? Hiroto: Why, a necklace that spells out the word \"love,\" of course! Apparently, a ton of places even do custom-made orders these days! Hiroto: It's the ultimate heartfelt Christmas present that combines both romance and surprise! Genius, isn't it?! Natsume: You're a freak. Hiroto: What the hell was that for?! Natsume: If someone gave me a love necklace for Christmas, I'd be pretty turned off. Hiroto: Surely giving a girl such a unique and memorable gift would increase your chances of success when confessing to her, though. Natsume: Why would you ever think that? Natsume: Unless that girl is a rapper, or the famous samurai Naoe Kanetsugu, I doubt they'd want a necklace like that. Hiroto: That's not true! The most widely accepted theory is that Naoe Kanetsugu's armor was decorated with the character for \"love\" in tribute to the Buddhist deity of martial arts, not because-- Natsume: Nobody cares. Hiroto: F-Fine! Then how about city-gazing?! Like, at night! Hiroto: Walking around looking at Christmas lights isn't a bad idea either, but for a fashionable girl who doesn't wear sneakers, that might take a bit of a toll on her feet! Natsume: That's pretty considerate of you, actually. Hiroto: So here's what you do. You book a room at some high-class hotel, then as the two of you are gazing out at the city lights, you come up and hug her gently from behind. Natsume: Why would he book a hotel for them? They're not even dating. Hiroto: Finally, for the finishing blow, you whisper into her ear, \"Let's show this city what our love looks like.\" Natsume: God, I think I'm going to puke. Hiroto: It's foolproof! Whaddaya think?! Natsume: That's just plain disgusting! Are you completely incapable of coming up with any normal ideas? Hiroto: But he's gonna wanna show her that he's not like other guys! Natsume: Yes, in a GOOD way! Not by showing her that he's a disgusting creep! Natsume: Are you even listening to yourself? Cut it out before you make him do something he'll regret! Kousei: I think I'm starting to see why you're not very popular with girls. Hiroto: The hell'd you say?! Kousei: I doubt you even know how to ask a girl out period. Hiroto: Excuse you. I know perfectly well how. Hiroto: \"Hey, how's it goin'? So, listen. I know this is kinda random, but do you want to go eat somewhere with me? I know this great place. I was actually planning to go with my friends, but they canceled on me last minute.\" Hiroto: See? Piece of cake. Kousei: Let's turn to our commentator, Shiki Natsume, for a reaction. Natsume: That was atrocious. Hiroto: That was WAY too brutal! Natsume: I think you ought to reconsider your approach a little more. Hiroto: Urk. I've been told that before... Natsume: You don't need some lame excuse to ask a girl on a date. Just be upfront about what you want to do, and when you want to do it. Natsume: If you want to pull out this \"special plan\" of yours, at least save it for AFTER you've started dating... Not that it'd be any less gross then, but still. Hiroto: I'll keep that in mind. Natsume: That goes for you too, Takamine-kun. Don't try too hard. Just pick an activity you're comfortable with. Kousei: Hmm. Natsume: Maybe take her to a movie, or go window shopping. Just something ordinary. The important thing is to keep the mood enjoyable. Natsume: As long as you can do that, your relationship will naturally progress beyond being mere friends. Natsume: It won't be too late to do something special for her later on, if you feel like your relationship is starting to get into a rut. Hiroto & Kousei: Whoa... Hiroto: That's the Solitary Sniper for you. She's got way more experience with dating than we do, that's for sure. Natsume: ...... Hiroto: Oops. Sorry for calling you that. Natsume: It's okay. I know that's what people call me. But to be honest... Natsume: Despite everything I said, I don't actually have a lot of relationship experience... None at all, in fact. So take my advice with a grain of salt. Kousei: Still, I appreciate being able to get some sensible input from a real girl. Kousei: And thank you too, Hiroto. You've been a big help too. Hiroto: What, by being a bad example to learn from? Is that what you're trying to say? Kousei: No, I'm serious. Thanks for hearing me out. Kousei: If I had to deal with this myself, I might've done something really stupid. Natsume: Seriously? Kousei: My heart feels so warm. Kousei: It's been really hard to deal with lately. I can't seem to calm down whenever I look at Akizuki-san. Kousei: I want to talk with her about something--anything. I want to spend more time together with her. Natsume: You really are a teenage girl. Hiroto: He's down bad, that's for sure. Kousei: Anyway, my chest feels a bit lighter now. Thanks, you guys. Hiroto: If there's anything else you need, let me know anytime. Kousei: Just out of curiosity... What kind of Christmas present would you give a girl, Hiroto? Hiroto: I'd give her an engagement ring! No shit! An insanely expensive brand-name one! Combined with an intimate handwritten letter! Natsume: What did I just say about taking things slow?! Kousei: I can't let my nerves get to me. Kousei: Deep breaths, Kousei. Be natural. Be casual. Kousei: If I can manage that, I'll be fine. Yeah. Kousei: Hey, Suzune-san. I'm back from class. Suzune: Hey there. Kousei: Any orders I can work on? Suzune: I was just about to get started on these two plates of pancakes. Kousei: Let me handle them. You go ahead and take your break. Suzune: You sure? Well, okay. Give me a shout if you need anything. Kousei: Will do. Kousei: Now then. Kanna: Coming! Kousei: Ah! Kousei: Yeah, I'm back. Kousei: I'm feeling fine too, by the way. Suzune-san's on break right now, so I just finished up these pancakes for her. Kanna: That's great. Well, I'd better carry these out before they get cold. Kousei: Sure. Kousei: Before you go, though... Kousei: Er, never mind. Be careful not to trip and fall. Kanna: I won't do that. I'm not a child. Kousei: ...... Kousei: I shouldn't be asking her out while we're on the job. That'd be a distraction. Kousei: There's still time. I have plenty of chances to ask her out today! Kousei: And just like that, the day's over. Kousei: Guess I'll get changed. Kanna: Takamine-san? Do you have a minute? Kousei: Huh? Kanna: You seemed to be acting somewhat strange today. Are you alright? Kanna: Hmm... It doesn't seem as if there's anything wrong with your soul. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Well... that's because... Kousei: ...... Kanna: Tomorrow's our day off, isn't it? I don't have anything particular planned. Kousei: In that case, would you mind coming with me somewhere? There's someplace I want to go. Kanna: Where would that be?

Kousei: I was trying to find the right moment to ask. Kanna: Oh, silly. You could've asked me that anytime. Kousei: I guess... I just didn't want to bother you while you were working and stuff, so... Kousei: A-Anyway, thank you. I'll see you tomorrow. Kanna: Right. I'm looking forward to it. Kousei: Great. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go outside...  Kanna: Huh? But you haven't finished changing yet. Kousei: Yeah, I know. I just need to step outside for a minute. Don't worry, I'll be right back. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Ngh... Kousei: Let's goooooooooo! I did it! Kousei: I was freaking out like crazy... Kousei: But... she said yes. Kanna: So that's the gist of it. You don't have any problem with us going out tomorrow, do you? Mikado: Hmm... You are free to do as you please, of course. Mikado: But I daresay that sounds like a date to me. Kanna: Huh? In what way? Mikado: The two of you are going out together, just the two of you. Kanna: Yeah... but we were alone that time we went out to buy me a phone too. Mikado: Be that as it may, tomorrow is the so-called Eve of Christmas Eve. Kanna: I mean, I suppose it is... Mikado: Since the cafe is open on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, neither of you would be able to take the day off work. Mikado: Do you not think that is why he chose tomorrow specifically, the 23rd, to ask you out? Kanna: You're reading too much into it. It's just a coincidence that the date happened to align like that. Mikado: Well, don't say I did not warn you. Kanna: It's not like that. I'm sure he simply wants to hang out as friends. Kanna: Besides, I'm a Grim Reaper. Takamine-san knows that full well. Mikado: I hope that he does. Kanna: You worry too much, Mikado-san. He doesn't think of me like th-- Kanna: ...... Mikado: ...... Kanna: W-We should be getting to bed. Mikado: Indeed. Whatever Takamine Kousei is thinking, we have no way of knowing. We may as well go to sleep. Kanna: (A date on the Eve of Christmas Eve? Takamine-san asking me out on a date? He'd never! Haha!) Kanna: (I know it SOUNDS like a date, but it's not.) Kanna: (He just needs my help with something.) \n\nWhile these examples may provide some guidance, evaluate their relevance to the current conversation.

Nozomi: Don't forget Mikado-san too. Mikado: Hm? Ah, yes. I had not mentioned it. Mikado: I am, in fact, Mikado Takanori. Nozomi: An illusion?! Kousei-kun, he just did a magic trick! Kousei: Err, it's no trick. Mei: Did some kind of problem spring up? Nozomi: This is all my fault. Mei: Huh? What did you do? Kanna: I'm sorry we're late. Natsume: Sorry for springing this on you all of a sudden. Mikado: Let's get right into it. Mei: You mean the shrine maiden festival? Suzune: If I recall, it's that event with all the street stalls and the shrine maiden dance at the end. Nozomi: Yes, that's the one. Suzune: I heard it was canceled this year, though. Kousei: No. The festival will proceed as originally planned. Mei: What? Really? Suzune: But there's only three days left until the new year, including today. Have you even started preparing? Mikado: The Sumizome family's shrine has deep ties to this town, after all. Mikado: As such, they were unable to flatly refuse, and now Nozomi is in quite the predicament as well. Mikado: That is why we called this emergency meeting. Natsume: Sumizome-san and Takamine-kun will be preparing for the dedication dance. Natsume: As for the rest of us, we're thinking of opening up a food stall for the festival. Suzune: A food stall? Wait--in three days?! Mikado: Yes. We would like you to devise a menu for it. Mikado: Think of it as a way of establishing friendly ties with the community. For a small, local business like ours, these acts of community engagement are often necessary. Suzune: I get what you're saying, but still. What kind of food would we even sell at a stall? Suzune: Naturally. This isn't going to be a restaurant; our customers won't be able to sit down to enjoy their food. Kousei: Couldn't we just sell something easy to eat while walking like takoyaki or chocolate bananas? Suzune: Even if it's just a food stall, we're going to be representing Cafe Stella. Mei: And when you think of Cafe Stella, you think of trendy sweets. Kousei: Trendy sweets you can eat while walking... ",
            "Mikado: It is about time! Nozomi: I wanna cuddle him some more. Kousei: Not that. I mean about him talking. Nozomi: Isn't that just Kanna-san using her ventriloquy? Kanna: I'm afraid I'm not. That voice you're hearing belongs to His Excellency himself. Nozomi: \"His Excellency\"? Mikado: She is referring to me, naturally. Nozomi: Huh? Whaaaaaaaaaat?! Nozomi: You mean this little fella really IS some kind of magical fairy or whatever?! Mikado: Good grief. You people just call me whatever you like... Nozomi: So does this mean Kanna-san really is a Grim Reaper too? Kanna: That's right. I know it may be hard to fathom, but it is the truth. Nozomi: O-Oh... Nozomi: I was deliberately ignoring Kousei-kun and Natsume-san when they started talking about Grim Reapers and stuff, but I never expected it to be true. Kousei: Wow. That's kinda rude, don't you think? Nozomi: I just thought this was some late-blooming chuunibyou phase. Kousei: Oh, come on. Nozomi: Yes. It looks like this kitty--err, this Cat Sidhe--really CAN talk. Mikado: Please do not call me that, Nozomi. I have suffered enough indignity today as it is. Nozomi: But Kousei-kun, how did you get mixed up with all these Grim Reapers and fairy creatures and whatnot? Kousei: It's a bit of a long story-- Kousei: Yes. And it's no normal butterfly. Kanna: It's a very unusual soul that possesses an immense power. Mikado: At the moment, we do not know how to make it come to terms with reincarnation. Mikado: But we must do something about it before the end of the year--while my talismans' protection still remain in effect. Kanna: Otherwise, something terrible will undoubtedly happen to you and your family. Nozomi: Could this have something to do with my dad's broken foot too? Kousei: Maybe. He did break his foot before I gave you those talismans. Nozomi: Urk... What should I do? Kousei: I did it so I could protect you and your family. Nozomi: Kousei-kun... Kousei: If we work together, I'm sure we can find a solution. Kousei: Don't be afraid, Nozomi. I promise I'll figure this out somehow. Nozomi: O-Okay! Nozomi: Thanks, Kousei-kun... Natsume: That's all well and good, but are you sure you can do this on your own, Takamine-kun? Kousei: Don't be afraid, Nozomi. I promise we'll figure this out somehow. Natsume: He actually corrected himself. Nozomi: How do we do that? Kanna: By hosting the dedication dance ceremony--the festival your shrine holds every year. If we can do that, the butterfly will return to slumber for another year. Mikado: This is merely a theory on our part. Mikado: But it is no coincidence that the annual dedication dance has been performed for centuries without fail. Mikado: The ancient Shinto priests knew that it was a way to ward off evil spirits. Kousei: Ah. You're saying the original reason for the dance was forgotten over the years, until only the tradition remained. Kousei: That certainly makes sense. Nozomi: New Year's Eve is only three days away, you know? Kousei: I know. That's why we're all going to have to put our heads together. Kousei: Everyone here is going to help. Not just me. Kousei: As long as we work together, I'm confident we'll figure something out! Nozomi: New Year's is always the busiest time for them. There's no one we can ask for help. Nozomi: Plus even if we DO decide to hold the ceremony, we'd have to talk to security, make the necessary preparations, and all that... Kanna: They are meant to be celebrations; a gathering of people and joyous emotions. Mikado: The dance is merely the means by which the shrine maiden dedicates the celebration as an offering to the gods. Mikado: To simply dance alone would have no meaning. Nozomi: But with how little time we have to announce it this year, it's up in the air. Kousei: Would it be better if there were more people present? Mikado: It certainly wouldn't hurt. Mikado: The more people there are, the greater the celebration. The greater the celebration, the greater the offering. Kousei: So what you're saying is, our safest bet is to have lots of stalls and flashy attractions to draw as many people as we can? Mikado: Hmm. Yes, I suppose so. Mikado: I shall look into this idea a bit more and see what I can do. Kousei: Great. So, Nozomi... Nozomi: Still, I don't know how we're going to find a shrine maiden on such short notice. Nozomi: I'll try asking Dad to see if he knows anyone... Hrmm... ",

Suzune: Alrighty then. Kousei: Ah, Suzune-san. Kousei: Before we get to work, I actually have a personal favor I want to ask you. Natsume: Yeah. Thank goodness all our chocolate desserts managed to sell out. Natsume: Come to think of it, though--why'd we make all those chocolate-flavored desserts instead of just chocolate? Kousei: Well, apparently it's a huge headache; finding the right type of cocoa, tempering the chocolate properly, and so on. Natsume: Huh. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Speaking of which... Natsume: Don't worry, I've got everything prepped for the curry. Let's head over to my place. Kousei: Oh. Right... Natsume: So, how was it? Well worth the wait? Kousei: It was amazing. Your cooking really is the best, Natsume. Natsume: Glad I didn't let you down. Kousei: ...... Natsume: What? Was there actually something wrong with it? Kousei: No, the curry was delicious. I mean it. Kousei: Just, um... Kousei: Let me ask you something. What day is it today? Natsume: The day legendary shogi player Yoshiharu Habu became the first person to win all seven major titles? Kousei: Nobody's talking about shogi here! Kousei: You're dodging the question on purpose, aren't you? Kousei: *stare*... Natsume: You don't have to give my those puppy dog eyes, geez... Kousei: Can I have my chocolate yet? Pretty please? Natsume: You've already eaten it, Grandpa. Remember? Kousei: I don't, actually. Natsume: Well, that's odd... because that was the curry's secret ingredient. A bar of chocolate. Kousei: %123;Why didn't you tell me?! Kousei: That's not fair! How was I supposed to know?! I never even got to taste that sweet, sweet chocolate! Natsume: *sigh*... I was planning to give it to you a little later, silly. Natsume: I didn't think you'd have so little faith in me. Do you not trust me or something? Kousei: No, I do. I just wasn't sure if you were even interested in the whole Valentine's tradition in the first place. Natsume: I'll admit that I do think it's a bit silly, personally. Natsume: But I have nothing against doing something for my boyfriend to show that I love him. Natsume: Mhh... *kiss* *smack*... Natsume: Nhhh... Ahhh... And there's an extra bonus for you. Natsume: I love you. Kousei: Thanks. I've always been pretty lonely on Valentine's Day... so I've never felt this happy before. Kousei: I'll treasure these chocolates for the rest of my life! Natsume: Don't. You're supposed to eat them. Kousei: I know. I really do want to keep them forever, though. But I guess I'll settle for savoring each bite. Kousei: Thanks for cooking today. And for the chocolates too. Kousei: So, err, this might sound a little sudden, but I want you to let me repay you. Natsume: *sigh*... Kousei: What? Why are you giving me that look? Natsume: You're probably about to suggest something perverted, aren't you? Kousei: You know you'd like that, Natsume. Natsume: W-Well, maybe... Natsume: But we have work tomorrow. Plus, you've got to set the mood a little more... before we do these things. Kousei: Well, unfortunately, that's not what I had in mind. Natsume: Huh? O-Oh, it's not? Kousei: Sex is all you think about these days, huh? Natsume: Nrghhhh... Natsume: Shut up, idiot. Kousei: Anyway, I wanted to repay you in a different way, so try to clear your schedule on Wednesday, February 24th. Kousei: A little early for White Day, I know. Natsume: Well... sure, I guess. Kousei: Promise me? Natsume: What are we doing on the 24th? Kousei: You'll see. There are some very special customers I've invited to come visit that day. Natsume: But are you sure you want me wearing this outfit? Kousei: Yeah. The outfit's important. Natsume: These \"customers\" you mentioned... don't tell me they're a bunch of cosplay-loving friends of yours? Kousei: Not even close. First of all, I don't even have those sort of friends! Kousei: I've got few enough normal friends as it is! Natsume: Oh, really? Then why are you making me wear this outfit? Kousei: You'll find out soon. Kousei: Hopefully. Natsume: You're not making any sense. "

I will speak to the other staff tomorrow morning to enlist their help as well. Kousei: How are you going to explain this to Hiuchidani-san and Suzune-san? Nozomi: Don't forget Mikado-san too. Mikado: Hm? Ah, yes. I had not mentioned it. Mikado: I am, in fact, Mikado Takanori. Nozomi: An illusion?! Kousei-kun, he just did a magic trick! Kousei: Err, it's no trick. Mei: Did some kind of problem spring up? Nozomi: This is all my fault. Mei: Huh? What did you do? Kanna: I'm sorry we're late. Natsume: Sorry for springing this on you all of a sudden. Mikado: Let's get right into it. Mei: You mean the shrine maiden festival? Suzune: If I recall, it's that event with all the street stalls and the shrine maiden dance at the end. Nozomi: Yes, that's the one. Suzune: I heard it was canceled this year, though. Kousei: No. The festival will proceed as originally planned. Mei: What? Really? Suzune: But there's only three days left until the new year, including today. Have you even started preparing? Mikado: The Sumizome family's shrine has deep ties to this town, after all. Mikado: As such, they were unable to flatly refuse, and now Nozomi is in quite the predicament as well. Mikado: That is why we called this emergency meeting. Natsume: Sumizome-san and Takamine-kun will be preparing for the dedication dance. Natsume: As for the rest of us, we're thinking of opening up a food stall for the festival. Suzune: A food stall? Wait--in three days?! Mikado: Yes. We would like you to devise a menu for it. Mikado: Think of it as a way of establishing friendly ties with the community. For a small, local business like ours, these acts of community engagement are often necessary. Suzune: I get what you're saying, but still. What kind of food would we even sell at a stall? Suzune: Naturally. This isn't going to be a restaurant; our customers won't be able to sit down to enjoy their food. Kousei: Couldn't we just sell something easy to eat while walking like takoyaki or chocolate bananas? Suzune: Even if it's just a food stall, we're going to be representing Cafe Stella. Mei: And when you think of Cafe Stella, you think of trendy sweets. Kousei: Trendy sweets you can eat while walking... , Mikado: It is about time! Nozomi: I wanna cuddle him some more. Kousei: Not that. I mean about him talking. Nozomi: Isn't that just Kanna-san using her ventriloquy? Kanna: I'm afraid I'm not. That voice you're hearing belongs to His Excellency himself. Nozomi: \"His Excellency\"? Mikado: She is referring to me, naturally. Nozomi: Huh? Whaaaaaaaaaat?! Nozomi: You mean this little fella really IS some kind of magical fairy or whatever?! Mikado: Good grief. You people just call me whatever you like... Nozomi: So does this mean Kanna-san really is a Grim Reaper too? Kanna: That's right. I know it may be hard to fathom, but it is the truth. Nozomi: O-Oh... Nozomi: I was deliberately ignoring Kousei-kun and Natsume-san when they started talking about Grim Reapers and stuff, but I never expected it to be true. Kousei: Wow. That's kinda rude, don't you think? Nozomi: I just thought this was some late-blooming chuunibyou phase. Kousei: Oh, come on. Nozomi: Yes. It looks like this kitty--err, this Cat Sidhe--really CAN talk. Mikado: Please do not call me that, Nozomi. I have suffered enough indignity today as it is. Nozomi: But Kousei-kun, how did you get mixed up with all these Grim Reapers and fairy creatures and whatnot? Kousei: It's a bit of a long story-- Kousei: Yes. And it's no normal butterfly. Kanna: It's a very unusual soul that possesses an immense power. Mikado: At the moment, we do not know how to make it come to terms with reincarnation. Mikado: But we must do something about it before the end of the year--while my talismans' protection still remain in effect. Kanna: Otherwise, something terrible will undoubtedly happen to you and your family. Nozomi: Could this have something to do with my dad's broken foot too? Kousei: Maybe. He did break his foot before I gave you those talismans. Nozomi: Urk... What should I do? Kousei: I did it so I could protect you and your family. Nozomi: Kousei-kun... Kousei: If we work together, I'm sure we can find a solution. Kousei: Don't be afraid, Nozomi. I promise I'll figure this out somehow. Nozomi: O-Okay! Nozomi: Thanks, Kousei-kun... Natsume: That's all well and good, but are you sure you can do this on your own, Takamine-kun? Kousei: Don't be afraid, Nozomi. I promise we'll figure this out somehow. Natsume: He actually corrected himself. Nozomi: How do we do that? Kanna: By hosting the dedication dance ceremony--the festival your shrine holds every year. If we can do that, the butterfly will return to slumber for another year. Mikado: This is merely a theory on our part. Mikado: But it is no coincidence that the annual dedication dance has been performed for centuries without fail. Mikado: The ancient Shinto priests knew that it was a way to ward off evil spirits. Kousei: Ah. You're saying the original reason for the dance was forgotten over the years, until only the tradition remained. Kousei: That certainly makes sense. Nozomi: New Year's Eve is only three days away, you know? Kousei: I know. That's why we're all going to have to put our heads together. Kousei: Everyone here is going to help. Not just me. Kousei: As long as we work together, I'm confident we'll figure something out! Nozomi: New Year's is always the busiest time for them. There's no one we can ask for help. Nozomi: Plus even if we DO decide to hold the ceremony, we'd have to talk to security, make the necessary preparations, and all that... Kanna: They are meant to be celebrations; a gathering of people and joyous emotions. Mikado: The dance is merely the means by which the shrine maiden dedicates the celebration as an offering to the gods. Mikado: To simply dance alone would have no meaning. Nozomi: But with how little time we have to announce it this year, it's up in the air. Kousei: Would it be better if there were more people present? Mikado: It certainly wouldn't hurt. Mikado: The more people there are, the greater the celebration. The greater the celebration, the greater the offering. Kousei: So what you're saying is, our safest bet is to have lots of stalls and flashy attractions to draw as many people as we can? Mikado: Hmm. Yes, I suppose so. Mikado: I shall look into this idea a bit more and see what I can do. Kousei: Great. So, Nozomi... Nozomi: Still, I don't know how we're going to find a shrine maiden on such short notice. Nozomi: I'll try asking Dad to see if he knows anyone... Hrmm... , Suzune: We all had a hand in making this chocolate cake, so make sure you savor every bite. Kousei: I will. Thank you. Kanna: Speaking of which, have you gotten anything from Natsume-san yet? Kousei: Uh, no, not yet... Kanna: You are going to have a Valentine's day date with her later today, aren't you? Kousei: Well, yeah... We're going to have dinner together. She's making me curry. Mei: Ohh. That sounds nice. Nozomi: *giggle* Looks like everything's going well between you two. Suzune: Alrighty then. Kousei: Ah, Suzune-san. Kousei: Before we get to work, I actually have a personal favor I want to ask you. Natsume: Yeah. Thank goodness all our chocolate desserts managed to sell out. Natsume: Come to think of it, though--why'd we make all those chocolate-flavored desserts instead of just chocolate? Kousei: Well, apparently it's a huge headache; finding the right type of cocoa, tempering the chocolate properly, and so on. Natsume: Huh. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Speaking of which... Natsume: Don't worry, I've got everything prepped for the curry. Let's head over to my place. Kousei: Oh. Right... Natsume: So, how was it? Well worth the wait? Kousei: It was amazing. Your cooking really is the best, Natsume. Natsume: Glad I didn't let you down. Kousei: ...... Natsume: What? Was there actually something wrong with it? Kousei: No, the curry was delicious. I mean it. Kousei: Just, um... Kousei: Let me ask you something. What day is it today? Natsume: The day legendary shogi player Yoshiharu Habu became the first person to win all seven major titles? Kousei: Nobody's talking about shogi here! Kousei: You're dodging the question on purpose, aren't you? Kousei: *stare*... Natsume: You don't have to give my those puppy dog eyes, geez... Kousei: Can I have my chocolate yet? Pretty please? Natsume: You've already eaten it, Grandpa. Remember? Kousei: I don't, actually. Natsume: Well, that's odd... because that was the curry's secret ingredient. A bar of chocolate. Kousei: %123;Why didn't you tell me?! Kousei: That's not fair! How was I supposed to know?!

Kousei: I'll treasure these chocolates for the rest of my life! Natsume: Don't. You're supposed to eat them. Kousei: I know. I really do want to keep them forever, though.

            "Suzune: Crud. Looks like I'm all out of beer. Mei: Would you like some tea? I haven't drunk directly out of this one yet. Suzune: Sure. By the way, these kelp rolls are delicious. Mei: Hehe. I'll be sure to let my grandma know. Have as many as you want! Suzune: Hey, Kousei! Is it ready yet? I'm already getting full from all these kelp rolls! Kousei: Sorry for the wait. I just finished now. Mei: But you added some kind of smoked ingredient, didn't you? Kousei: You'll see. Go ahead and try it. Suzune: Uh-huh. Mei: ...... Suzune: ...... Mei: Oh? Suzune: Something tastes different. It's a lot more fragrant when I bite into it. Mei: It can't be the bacon, right? Where's this smoky flavor coming from? Suzune: It doesn't seem to be the vegetables, either... What exactly did you do? Kousei: It's the black pepper. That's what I smoked. Mei: Ohh! It's the seasoning! Kousei: Yeah. In a way, black pepper is actually the main ingredient in carbonara. That's where the name of the dish comes from, in fact. Suzune: It's derived from the Italian word for charcoal burner, right? Because there's supposed to be so much pepper on it that it turns black. Kousei: Exactly. I was contemplating whether or not to smoke the salt, but I thought that would change the flavor too much. Kousei: So I decided to smoke the pepper instead. This way it adds a nice kick without destroying the balance of the dish. Suzune: You're right. It really does add a nice kick. It's amazing how a small addition can make such a big difference. Suzune: Even though the seasoning is fundamentally the same, the flavor has a lot more depth. Mei: This is amazing! Just like authentic carbonara! Not that I know what authentic carbonara tastes like, but still! Kousei: Glad you like it. I only just finished smoking the pepper, so the smell might be a little harsh-- Kousei: But as long as I let it sit for a while, it should disappear. Then all I need to do is mix it with some regular black pepper to fine tune the flavor. Suzune: Sounds good. It could use a bit of adjusting, but I definitely think this is good enough to serve to our customers. In all honesty, this really is delicious. Kousei: Thanks. What about you-- Mei: Phew! That was good! Kousei: Wow. Not even a crumb left. Mei: It was too good! Just like real Italian cuisine! Not that I know what real Italian cuisine tastes like, but still! Suzune: You already said that earlier. I get what you're trying to say, though. Kousei: Ahaha... I wasn't expecting this much of a reaction. I'm flattered. Mei: Seriously, it was delicious! You're a genius, Senpai! Kousei: O-Oh stop it... Suzune: Well, since Mei-san is showering you in praise, I'm going to be a little more critical. Suzune: Like you said before, the dish still needs some balancing. Kousei: I know. It's got a pretty strong flavor, so I'm gonna try letting it mellow overnight next time. Suzune: Instead of trying to figure out everything on your own, though, you should ask the others at the cafe to taste-test your dish first. Suzune: Then you can decide if you want to tone it down, or if you actually want to emphasize that distinct flavor. Mei: Ohh, I see! The more unique it tastes, the more likely it is to grab people's interest! Suzune: Exactly. But you might get differing opinions on which one is better, which'll make it harder to decide. Suzune: Still, it's up to you. At the very least, I don't think anyone's going to object to you adding this dish to our menu. Kousei: Alright. I'll give it a shot. Kousei: And thanks, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Huh? Kousei: I wouldn't have come up with this idea without you, so thanks. Mei: Please! All I did was suggest the first thing that came to mind. Mei: Don't underestimate your own genius, Senpai! This really is amazing! Kousei: Th-Thanks. Suzune: Ahem. Kousei: Wh-What? Suzune: We're all out of cheese and sausages, so I'm gonna need you to make me some more. Kousei: You already ate them all? I wanted some too, you know. Suzune: Oh, stop griping. C'mon! Kousei: Alright, alright. Fine. Mei: Senpai! I want to try smoking some other things too! Kousei: Sure. I'll rummage around my fridge and see what else we can toss in the smoker. Mei: This is gonna be great! Kanna: Here's to another great year! Let's all do our best! Suzune: Alrighty. Ready to get back to work? Kousei: Yes, ma'am. Kousei: Not so much changed as added a new twist. I tried smoking the pepper first. Natsume: I can't say it looks or smells particularly different, though... Kousei: You'll see once you try it. Nozomi: Well, I'm gonna go ahead and dig in! Nozomi: That faint hint of smokiness... It's amazing how much difference it makes. Natsume: You said you smoked it yourself? Kousei: Yep. It was all Hiuchidani-san's idea. Mei: Don't be silly. You came up with the idea to smoke the black pepper. Mei: All I did was suggest that we try to make our own bacon. Natsume: Ah. So you spent the break thinking up ways to improve our menu... Natsume: That's very commendable of you. I'm impressed. Kousei: Thanks. How do you think it tastes? Kanna: I, for one, think it's delicious. It gives the dish a lot more added depth. Nozomi: I think so too. This seems like it'd be a real crowd-pleaser. Natsume: It certainly is delicious, but... Kousei: But? Natsume: I feel like the pepper's unique smokiness has a sort of... mature taste to it. Natsume: It's definitely not bad by any means, but--and this is just my personal opinion... Natsume: But I think I actually prefer the regular carbonara. Natsume: So while I'm all for adding this to our menu, I don't think it should replace the original version. Nozomi: You said you added the smoked black pepper to the pasta at the end, right? Kousei: Yeah, I did. Nozomi: In that case, why don't we just serve our regular carbonara with a shaker of smoked black pepper on the side? Nozomi: That way, customers can add as much or as little as they want. Natsume: How would we know how much to prepare in advance, though? Some customers might use a lot more than others. Suzune: A lot of beef bowl restaurants used to do the same thing with their special shichimi spices, but they had to stop the practice a little while back. Suzune: Some customers were using unbelievable amounts of spice, which ended up hurting their profits. Nozomi: Oh... I guess that won't work then. Kanna: It seems like our safest option would be to add this smoked pepper version as a separate item on the menu. Kousei: Alright. So I have all the judges' approval? Kanna: Absolutely. I think this would make a fine addition to our menu. Nozomi: Me too. Natsume: Me three. Kanna: What do you think, Mikado-san? Mikado: I believe Natsume mentioned earlier that this dish had a rather mature taste. However, many of our customers also come here specifically for our coffee and tea. Mikado: Judging from what I have gathered, this would suit their preferences well. Mikado: Therefore, I am in agreement. Kousei: Thank goodness... Mei: Way to go, Senpai! Kousei: Thanks! Kousei: I was just gonna do it at home, actually... Mikado: Among other problems, that would be quite expensive. I would not recommend you do that. Kousei: I guess that's true. Mikado: I do have some other ideas you may wish to consider. Are you free to talk after this? Kousei: Sure. I've got time. Kanna: In that case, let's call it a day here. See you tomorrow, everyone. Natsume: See you tomorrow. Nozomi: See you tomorrow! Kousei: Phew... Kousei: Huh? Hiuchidani-san? Mei: Hey. Kousei: What are you still doing here? Mei: I was waiting for you to finish. Kousei: You could've waited inside. Mei: Ahaha. I didn't want to bother you guys. Mei: Anyway, I know I should've said something earlier... but would you mind walking me home? Kousei: Sure. I don't mind. Let's go. Mei: Thanks! Mei: Congratulations on getting your new recipe approved, by the way. Kousei: Well, you helped with that. Mei: Not at all. You did this on your own, Senpai. Kousei: Nah, it's all thanks to you. I would've never come up with this idea on my own. Kousei: Seriously, thank you. I'm really grateful. Kousei: This might sound kind of melodramatic... but I think I've gained a little more confidence in myself now. Mei: Ehehe... You're gonna make me blush. I don't mean to sound melodramatic either, but, like... Mei: You've done a lot for me as well, Senpai. Ever since you've helped me open up about my left eye, I feel like a huge weight's been lifted off my shoulders. Mei: That's why I wanted to be able to return the favor if I could. Mei: I'm glad I managed to be of some small help to you. Kousei: It wasn't small at all. You were a big help. Kousei: I was hoping to do something like this before I had to deal with my exams, so I'm glad it all went so well. Mei: Oh, your exams are coming up? Kousei: At the end of the month, yeah. Mei: Does that mean you're gonna be working fewer hours? Kousei: No, I'll be working the same as usual. I'll do fine as long as I pay attention in class. Kousei: And I can always study after work too. Mei: You're a pretty diligent student, aren't you? Kousei: I don't know about that... I'm just the sort of guy who hates procrastinating. Mei: That's what it means to be diligent, Senpai. I think that's something to be proud of. Kousei: Nah, trust me... I can be pretty lazy when I want. Mei: But in front of me, at least, you're always hardworking and dependable. Kousei: Okay, sheesh. Stop flattering me. It's gonna go to my head. Mei: Ahaha! Alright. Mei: Well, good night, Senpai. Kousei: Good night. And sorry you had to wait for me earlier. Mei: That's okay. I waited because I wanted to congratulate you. Mei: Anyway, see you tomorrow! Kousei: Yeah. See you tomorrow. Mei: ...... Mei: Hmm... Exams... ",
            "Mei: Phew. I thought I was running late, but it looks like you arrived at the same time as me. Kousei: Yeah, I just got out of class. Kousei: Shiki-san and Nozomi should already be here, so let's head inside. Mei: Okay. Mei: Good morning! Kanna: Welcome, you two. Mei: It's a little weird being greeted with a \"Welcome\" when the cafe's closed. Kanna: Then by that logic, saying \"Good morning\" is weird too, no? We're not working. Mei: I guess that's true. Kanna: You're here to study for your exams, right? Natsume-san and Nozomi-san are already here. Kousei: Yeah, sorry. Nozomi: It's fine. You two were in class. Natsume: You don't have to apologize. It's no big deal to us. Kanna: What would everyone like to drink? I'll prepare some refreshments. Nozomi: Huh? But... Kanna: It's no trouble at all. If it'll help you focus on your studies, I'd be happy to help. Nozomi: That's really nice of you. In that case, I'll have a cup of Earl Grey. Mei: Can I get a glass of orange juice? Kanna: Sure. Kanna: What about you two? Natsume: I'll have an Earl Grey too. Kousei: I'll have a coffee. Kanna: Alright. Kousei: Let's get to it then. Did you manage to find the stuff I asked for? Natsume: Here. These were the only ones I had left. Kousei: Thanks. These should help. Natsume: We might be in different majors, but you managed to get into Hitotsuboshi too, so you had to have gotten high grades yourself. Kousei: Well, I had a lot of help, as I'm sure you can imagine. Plus, my grades were only just barely good enough to be accepted. Nozomi: Urgh. These tests are crazy. I can't even figure out this last question with the answer in front of me. Mei: I'm getting a headache just looking at it. Kousei: Yeah, there are quite a few nasty questions in here. Natsume: You can thank my teacher, Saeki-sensei, for that. Apparently, he was a huge math buff. Natsume: Rumor had it he made these questions specifically to be solved using applied mathematics, just to show students the beauty of mathmatics. Nozomi: I'm going to go out on a limb and say he didn't succeed. Natsume: Yeah, most of us couldn't stand his class. Not that we hated him, per se; he was a fine person, just his tests were awful. Mei: That's what I hear too. Kousei: This teacher still teaches there? Mei: Yeah, he sure does. Kousei: Well, these tests should be great reference material then. Kousei: As for the English ones, all these questions seem pretty standard. Natsume: At least when I was there, the only subject that had insanely difficult questions was math. Kousei: Good. Then as long as we use these tests and the textbook to review, you should be able to avoid failing. Natsume: Sounds like a lot of rote memorization, though. Kousei: It'll have to do, for now. There's not enough time for her to re-learn all the material. Mei: Thank you very much. Nozomi: At the moment, I guess I'm struggling with Natsume-san's math questions the most. Nozomi: An in-depth explanation would really help. Natsume: Alright. I'll walk you both through it, so listen up. Nozomi: Okay! Mei: I'm all ears. Mei: Thank you! Nozomi: Sorry for the trouble. And thanks. Natsume: Thank you for doing this, Akizuki-san. Natsume: So anyway--if I apply this formula here, using the value I calculated above, that should give me the answer. Does that make sense? Nozomi: Ahh, I see. Now that you explain it like that, I sort of understand... Maybe... Maybe not? Mei: You're amazing, Nozomi-chan. I still don't get it at all! Natsume: Well, that's no surprise. You're learning from scratch. Natsume: I'll try to explain it as simply as I can, okay? But let me know right away if there's something you don't understand. Mei: Okaaay... *sigh*... Kousei: You're sighing way too much. Natsume: If you're not having any trouble with what I just explained, Sumizome-san, you can go ahead and start studying something else. Nozomi: Well, I wouldn't say I fully understand it yet. Nozomi: Alright, though. Can I borrow your English test? I want to use it to study. Natsume: Be my guest. Mei: Sorry I'm delaying us, Nozomi-san. Nozomi: Hey, it's not a big deal. Nozomi: The whole reason we're having this study session is to learn! Nozomi: So let's work hard and do our best to pass, okay? Mei: Yeah! Kanna: And here's your coffee, Takamine-san. Kousei: Oh, thanks. Kanna: By the way, what are you doing? Kousei: I'm putting together a list of stuff I want to cover. Kanna: Oh, okay. Preparing your teaching materials. Would you like me to help? Kousei: You'd be willing? Kanna: Don't worry. I can at least help you organize everything. Kanna: Everyone's studying their hardest. I want to chip in to help too. Kousei: Alright. Grab a seat. Kanna: Thank you. Nozomi: Kousei-kun, can I ask you something? Kousei: What's up? Nozomi: How come the answer to this one is number two? The other choices sound like they make sense too. Kousei: Hm? Let me see. Ah. Well, if you look at the paragraph before the blank, you can tell whether it's a factual or hypothetical statement. Kousei: The question is asking about something that happened in the past, so the answer has to be number two. Number one is a conjunction, so that wouldn't make sense. See? There's a comma here. Nozomi: Oh, you're right! Urk... Why didn't I catch that? Kousei: It's an easy mistake to make. This whole section can be a little tricky. Kousei: But it's something you need to know. You'll find these sorts of questions on the English proficiency test as well. Nozomi: Really? Alright, thanks. I'd better study it some more then. Kanna: You're actually quite smart, aren't you, Takamine-san? Nozomi: You wouldn't think it, would you? We've known each other for ages, and he always helps me study for tests, but even I still can't believe it sometimes. Nozomi: I never see him cramming at home, so I have no idea how his grades are so good. Kousei: Hey, I put in the effort just like everybody else. Kanna: Is that true? Kousei: The most efficient way to retain information is to pay attention in class. That, and taking notes. Kousei: If I do that, a single glance is all it takes to remember what I learned, which also helps me cut down on review time. Kanna: More haste, less speed, as they say. Nozomi: He's been saying that stuff for years. But if it was that easy to pay attention in class, we wouldn't be asking for help in the first place. Nozomi: Ugh, I can't do this. My concentration is shot. Mei: Me too. It feels like my brain is about to burn out... *sputter* *sputter*... Natsume: Oh, it's getting quite late. Alright. Let's call it a day. Mei: *siiigh* Thank you very much... Nozomi: Thank you! Natsume: You're welcome. So what do you think? Feeling a little more confident now? Mei: Uhh, yeah. I think I understand a bit more now... sort of. Natsume: Ah. Well, I'm glad my explanations made sense to you. Mei: I'll try reviewing everything again once I get home. Natsume: If there's anything you don't understand, let me know. Natsume: Even if it's something we've gone over already, don't be embarrassed. It happens sometimes. Mei: Okay. Thank you for your help. Kousei: Why don't we get you to take the same tests Shiki-san lent us tomorrow? Kousei: After you review the questions you get wrong, you can retake them again the next day. Natsume: I think that's a good idea too. Mei: But, like, won't I just be solving the same questions over and over? Natsume: There's nothing wrong with that. The worst thing would be for you to only think you understand. Kousei: Yeah, the goal here is to make sure you comprehend what you're learning. Kousei: If you can get the same grades Shiki-san did, you should be able to pass your exams without a hitch. But simply memorizing her answers won't mean anything. Mei: Yes, I know. Kousei: Are you okay with that too, Nozomi? Nozomi: Sounds good to me. Natsume: Starting tomorrow, I want you to come in to the cafe even on your days off. Kousei: We'll be able to help you study if you use the break room. Though it'll have to be while we're on the job. Mei: Alright. Thank you kindly. Kanna: Also, take these. I made copies of all your English and Japanese history study materials. Nozomi: Thank you so much! Kousei: Japanese history will largely be pure memorization, but for English, make sure you think about your answers carefully and review them. Mei: I will. Kousei: And thanks for helping out too, Akizuki-san. Kanna: Not at all. Helping people in need is also a part of my job now. Mei: Thanks for everything today. Natsume: Don't thank us just yet. Thank us once you've passed your exams. Mei: True. Alright then! I'll do my best! Nozomi: I'm hooome. Rokurou: Welcome back, Nozomi. Rokurou: Pretty late today, aren't you? I thought you didn't have work on Wednesdays. Nozomi: I was studying with a friend today. Kousei-kun and one of my coworkers were helping us prepare for our mid-terms. Nozomi: I wasn't playing around, so relax. Rokurou: That's not really what I'm worried about... Rokurou: I'm glad to see you working so hard, but make sure you don't overdo it. Rokurou: You've been staying up rather late these days, haven't you? Pulling all-nighters isn't good for your health. Nozomi: I know, geez. That's why I'm doing this now, so I don't have to stay up all night. Nozomi: Anyway, I'm going back to my room to do a bit more review. Rokurou: Don't you want to take a bath? Nozomi: Later. Nozomi: ...... Nozomi: ...... Nozomi: ... Nozomi: Nh... Ngh! Ahh, it's already this late? Nozomi: *sigh*... I studied a whole, whole lot. I've never been able to do this much on my own before. Nozomi: I'd better go take a bath now. If I don't get some sleep soon, I won't be able to wake up on time tomorrow. ",
            "Mei: Ah, Senpai! Kousei: Hey. You know, I just realized something after seeing your outfit. Mei: What's that? Kousei: You're on winter break. Mei: Ahaha! Seriously? Why do you think we're meeting up this early in the day? Kousei: True. For some reason, I guess I assumed you'd want to put all this off until after the holidays. Mei: I don't want school getting in the way. Plus, Suzune-san says we're going to be ridiculously busy on Christmas. Kousei: You're working on Christmas? Mei: Yep. I specifically asked to. Kousei: You aren't doing anything with your friends? Mei: Ahaha... Well, they've all got boyfriends, so... Kousei: Ah. Not too surprising then. Mei: You're working Christmas too, aren't you? And Christmas Eve as well, if I recall. Kousei: Yeah. I don't have any plans either, so I figured I might as well. Mei: Sad being single, isn't it? Kousei: Yeah... Mei: Well, not exactly. I recognize her, but I doubt she recognizes me. Mei: Yep. I thought I recognized her from somewhere, so I came here yesterday to double-check. And I was right. Kousei: Didn't take us long to find her, did it? Come to think of it, this is where you and I found out about Yuina's dad too. Mei: Hey, you're right! Maybe this is a lucky place. Kousei: Maybe. Or maybe it's you. Mei: Huh? Me? Kousei: It almost feels like you have a knack for running into people with butterflies or something. Mei: I'm not really sure how to feel about that. Kousei: Sorry. Just a thought. Kousei: Me neither. Mei: Weird. Maybe she isn't the same person? Kousei: Or maybe she already solved her own issues before we could intervene? Mei: I wonder... Hm? Wait, wh-what? Kousei: I see it. Mei: I've never seen anyone's wisps appear and disappear like that. Kousei: What do you mean? Mei: Ah. The guy's back. Kousei: ...... Mei: ...... Kousei: The butterfly's flying away. Mei: You're right. I... can't see the wisp anymore. Kousei: Hmm... Mei: Maybe that man has powers too. Powers like mine. Kousei: The power to repel butterflies, instead of attracting them? It's possible, I guess... Mei: Ah. We probably look really suspicious right now, don't we? Kousei: Huh? Oh, right. Why don't we go over there? Kousei: Hmm. Let's try giving Akizuki-san a call first. Kousei: This could be an unusual case, so we don't want to act rashly. Mei: Okay. Good point! Kanna: Hello? Kousei: This is Takamine. Kanna: Do you need something? Kanna: You said the butterfly disappears whenever this coworker of hers is nearby, correct? Kousei: Yeah. And whenever he leaves, the butterfly comes back. Kousei: Hiuchidani-san thought that maybe the man had some kind of power to repel butterflies... Kanna: *sigh* I didn't think you two were THIS obtuse... Kousei: Come again? Kanna: She's obviously lovestruck. Kousei: What? Sh-She's in love? Kanna: She is. If I had to guess, I'd say that this woman is secretly in love with her coworker. Kousei: She has a crush on him? Wait, really? That's why she's attracting butterflies? Kanna: Hey, don't be so dismissive of the power of love. Kanna: It has the power to incite our deepest, darkest passions. Love inflames the soul, for better or for worse. Kanna: And I would daresay that love is what's thrown that woman's emotions into turmoil. Kanna: She feels happy when they're together, but depressed when they're apart. Kanna: That would explain why the butterfly comes and goes like that. Kousei: I... guess? Kanna: She's probably agonizing over whether or not to confess her feelings to him. Kanna: But if she continues to remain under the butterfly's influence, she may lose hope and decide to give up on him altogether. Kousei: So we should use Hiuchidani-san's powers to capture her butterfly to prevent that from happening? Kanna: To be honest, I'm not entirely sure. If she ends up being rejected anyway, she may become even MORE susceptible to the butterfly's influence. Kanna: I'll leave it up to you to decide what to do, though. And again, please try not to draw unnecessary attention to yourselves. Kousei: I know. Thanks for the help, Akizuki-san. Kousei: Yeah. Apparently, the woman's in love with her coworker, and that's why her emotions are so unstable. Mei: Ohh... Sh-She's in love... That was why! Mei: Th-This feels, like, really embarrassing to say, even though she's a complete stranger... Kousei: It's almost Christmas too. She might be thinking about confessing to him tomorrow or the day after. Mei: Wh-What? Mei: Ngh... Ahh! Kousei: Y-You okay? Mei: I-I'm sorry. I'm just, um, not really used to talking about these sorts of things... Mei: It's getting me a little too worked up... Kousei: Want me to go get you something to drink? Mei: N-No, I'm fine... Kousei: Right. Whenever she's together with him, her spirits temporarily lift, which is why the wisp disappears. Kousei: But when they're apart, she goes back to feeling anxious, which is when the wisp returns. Kousei: Or at least, that's what Akizuki-san's theory is. Mei: Hrmm... Mei: ...... Mei: What if... Kousei: Hm? Mei: What if we do nothing and just let things run their course? Mei: Her wisp already goes away on its own from time to time without me having to make it disappear. Mei: I'm not sure I should be interfering... Kousei: Well... I suppose Akizuki-san DID say the situation wasn't urgent. Kousei: Trust me, you'd know if it was. There'd be a lot more butterflies. Kousei: That woman only has one or two around her at most, so she isn't terribly affected by them. At least, for now. Kousei: Even if we do nothing, it's possible that she'll overcome their influence on her own and confess her feelings. Kousei: But that said, we could still be way off mark. It may have nothing to do with love. Mei: Oh, true... There could be something else that's troubling her. Kousei: From Mikado's point of view, her personal problems aren't really our concern. The important thing is that we catch the butterfly. Mei: Yeah. That's their job, after all. Mei: Then I guess this was our only choice from the start... Mei: It's done. Kousei: Wow. Mei: Huh? Kousei: That was incredible. Beautiful, even. Mei: W-Was it? I can't really tell, myself... Kousei: It definitely looks like she has. Mei: I hope it goes well... Kousei: That's up to her. All we can do is pray that it does. Mei: Yeah. Kousei: If she gets rejected, though... Mei: Hey, don't say that, Senpai. You're gonna jinx it! Kousei: M-My bad. Kousei: Anyway, we've done all we can. The rest is out of our hands. Mei: Alrighty. Mission complete! Kousei: Yep. Not that I actually did anything. Mei: Ahaha! You phoned for help. That counts plenty, I think. Kousei: It'd feel weird to just go home now... Why don't we grab a drink or something? Mei: Good idea! I also want to see if anything happens between those two. Kousei: In that case, how about we get-- Mei: Let's get smoothies! Kousei: Thought you'd say that. Mei: Thanks for paying for me again. Kousei: No problem. It can be your reward for catching the butterfly. Mei: Hehe. You're the best. Mei: By the way, I heard that we're going to be helping bake cakes tomorrow. Kousei: Oh, right. Apparently we received a lot more orders than we expected, so we need all hands on deck. Kousei: Suzune-san wants everyone to pitch in and help. Mei: My shift doesn't start till the afternoon, though. Will I even make it in time to help? Kousei: Suzune-san says we'll be baking them so they're ready just in time for customers to pick up. Kousei: So don't worry. There's gonna be plenty of work to go around. Mei: Alrighty! I don't know if I'll be any good at baking, though... Kousei: You'll probably be put in charge of sales. Mei: Oh, right. I guess we can't have everyone making cakes. Mei: Sounds like it's gonna be a pretty tough day tomorrow. Let's get through this together! Kousei: It'll definitely be busy, but at least we'll get to spend the holidays together with everyone at the cafe. Mei: Ahaha! True that. Mei: Oh, Senpai! Look! Kousei: And it must've gone well. Mei: Yeah! I'm so happy for her. Mei: A Christmas date with her crush... How nice. Kousei: Too bad the only date we have is our jobs. Mei: Urk... Talk about depressing... Kousei: Well, you ready to get going? Mei: Sure. Kousei: We can tell Akizuki-san what happened tomorrow. It's gonna be a busy day, so we should get home early and rest up. Mei: Oh, well I wouldn't mind going to tell her right now, actually! Kousei: You just want to play with Mikado some more, don't you? Mei: Urk... How'd you know? Kousei: It was written all over your face. Mei: Ngh... Can you blame me?! His amazing fluffiness is enough to make anyone go crazy! Mei: Ah. I can be a little too candid sometimes, can't I? I'm sorry. I'll try to be more careful. Kousei: Eh, I don't mind. Feel free to be yourself. I'd prefer that, actually. Mei: Really? Well, please forgive me if I start acting too friendly. Ehehe. Mei: Welp, let's go on home! Kousei: Sounds like a plan. Mei: Let's work real hard tomorrow! Kousei: O-Okay... Kanna: Yes... Nozomi: I-I'll try to hang in there... Kanna: Still, it's not all bad. We wouldn't have gotten such a flood of orders if people didn't love your cakes. Nozomi: Even at my school, there are a ton of kids who are fans of your baking. Suzune: Well, I am a professional. Can't go losing to other restaurants in terms of quality. Suzune: Though... I do apologize for biting off more than I could chew. I knew I should've put a limit on the number of orders. Kousei: But it wasn't an impossible amount. We're nearly there. Kanna: Yeah. Let's hang in there just a little bit longer! Nozomi: Okay! Suzune: You can say that again. I'm exhausted... Natsume: I thought selling cakes would be easier than baking them... Boy, was I wrong. Kousei: I never stepped out of the kitchen today, but there must've been a crazy number of customers. Mei: You wouldn't believe it. We somehow managed to pull through with the three of us, but we could barely keep up. Natsume: Even without counting the people who were here to pick up advance orders, there were a ton of customers who came to buy our regular cakes too... Mei: But even those were flying off the shelves. Natsume: Yeah. I know you guys tried to restock them as fast as you could, but even then they would sell out almost instantly. Suzune: That's probably what I regret the most. Shouldn't have prioritized the advance orders so much. Mikado: Now I understand where the phrase \"selling like hotcakes\" comes from. It's incredible the effect the Christmas holidays have on sales. Kousei: Coming from someone on the kitchen side, you don't know the half of it. Suzune: I mean, they say sales typically go up tenfold on Christmas Eve. Cake stores everywhere are working overtime. Nozomi: Even though Christmas itself is tomorrow, it almost feels like we had more advance orders for today. Suzune: Yep. Christmas Eve is usually the peak in terms of sales. But make no mistake, we'll still be plenty busy tomorrow as well. Natsume: It's an excellent business opportunity, for sure. That said, I'm kind of worried that we're working you too hard, Suzune-san. Suzune: I could say the same for the rest of you. We've gotta strike while the iron's hot, though, so let's keep it up for one more day. Kanna: Agreed. Let's all get a good night's rest so we can be ready for tomorrow. Natsume: See you tomorrow, everyone. Mei & Nozomi: See you all tomorrow! Mei: Y-Yes. Mikado: Mei. Mei: Yes? Mikado: Why are you staring at me with those bloodshot eyes? Mei: I was, um... wondering if you could transform back into your-- Mikado: No. Mei: ...... Kanna: I've never seen anyone's spirits drop that fast. Mikado: Good grief. I am not your pet cat. Mei: You're right. I'm sorry... Mikado: So, what happened after you captured the butterfly? Kousei: She seemed to brighten up considerably. Kousei: And I'm positive that change was due to the influence of Hiuchidani-san's power. Kousei: But assuming we were right about her being lovestruck, she'll most likely become depressed again if she's dumped, so we may have to monitor her situation again if that happens. Kanna: You're sure she didn't notice you two at all? Mei: No. We never got close to her, so I don't think she could've noticed us. Mikado: Even if she had noticed you, I doubt the woman would have linked you to the improvement in her mood. Mikado: The important thing is that you managed to capture the butterfly. Now all that's left is for Mei to learn how to release it. Mei: I'll try my best! Kanna: Just remember to practice only when we're around, and not on your own. Kanna: If you were to accidentally release your butterflies by mistake, there's no telling what effect it could have on the people around you. Mei: Got it! Mikado: You've done well. Make sure you get plenty of rest tonight. Mei: I will! Thank you! Kanna: Have a good night, you two. Kousei: Good night. Mei: Hey, Senpai! You wanna stop by someplace with me? Kousei: I was about to suggest the same thing. You want to go see how that woman's doing, right? Mei: Ahaha. I'm just curious. Mei: I have the feeling she won't be at the store, but it wouldn't hurt to take a look. Kousei: Yeah. Mei: Alright! Let's go. Mei: Hmm... Looks like I was right. Kousei: Guess she isn't here. Mei: She's probably out somewhere with her crush right now. Kousei: Maybe. Probably not here at the mall, though. Mei: Ahaha. Yeah. Who would want to go on a date where they work? Mei: But even if they were here, we wouldn't be able to spot them with how many people there are. Kousei: True. Nothing but Christmas couples as far as the eye can see. Mei: ...... Kousei: Hm? Mei: N-Nothing. It's just... you're a guy and I'm a girl, so... Mei: Other people might think we're a couple too, and that's a little embarrassing... Kousei: You don't want to be seen with me? Ouch... Mei: N-No, that's not what I meant! Kousei: I'm kidding, I'm kidding. You really aren't good with romance and stuff, are you? Mei: I-I'm just not used to it, I guess... Mei: ...... Mei: Say, Senpai... What do you think of me? Kousei: Huh? Wh-Wh-What do you mean? Mei: W-Wait, that came out wrong! I don't mean it like THAT! Mei: I mean, what do you think of me as a person? What kind of impression do you have of me? Kousei: O-Oh, uh, let me think... Mei: Do you think I'm rude, or difficult to approach? Kousei: Oh, no. I've never thought of you as that. Mei: Really? Kousei: Really. If anything, you're the opposite. I've always thought you were very cheery and easy to talk to. Mei: Ah... Thank goodness. I guess I'm doing a good job then... Kousei: What do you mean? Mei: ...... Mei: This might be a little off topic, but... Kousei: I'm listening. Mei: I once told my mom and dad about my eye too. Mei: But they seemed to think I was joking, so they just laughed it off. Mei: Even when I started growing out my bangs, they thought I was just going through my... what'cha call it... my edgy phase? Mei: That's when I realized I wasn't normal, and they didn't understand me. Mei: Ever since then, I stopped talking to people. Mei: It might be a bit dramatic to say I was traumatized by the experience... Mei: But in a way, I sort of was. It's always there, in the back of my mind. Mei: The frustration of not being understood. Mei: The burden of having to hide who I really am. Mei: I know I'm not normal. The truth is, I'm constantly afraid that I'll never fit in with those around me. Kousei: What do you mean? If anything, you're always the center of attention. Kousei: Out of all of us, you're undoubtedly the best at handling customers. Everyone at the cafe relies on you. Mei: Ahaha. Thank you. I appreciate it. Mei: You know, I wish I could work at the cafe forever. Mei: It makes me incredibly happy to know that I finally met other people who completely understand me. Mei: I've never cared much about the Christmas holidays, honestly... Mei: I might not have a boyfriend to spend it with, but at least I got to spend it with people who understand me. Mei: So thank you, Senpai. Mei: Thank you for paying attention to me. Kousei: I'm, er... glad I could help you be yourself. Mei: Absolutely! Kousei: Don't sweat it. I've got a bit of an unusual situation of my own, actually. Kousei: I understand how it feels, not being normal. Mei: You do? Kousei: There's a bit of a problem with my soul, you see. And I'm looking for a way to fix it. Mei: Is there anything I can do to help? Kousei: Well... Mei: Oh. Well, let me know if there's ever anything I can do to help! Kousei: I will. Thanks. Mei: Hey, I've got an idea! Like, this is way off topic, but just hear me out. Kousei: Hm? Mei: Let's go get another smoothie! Kousei: Sure. Guess that's sort of our tradition now, every time we come here. Mei: Ahaha! I guess so! But let me pay for you this time! Kousei: Nah, you don't have to. Mei: Nuh-uh, I am. I still haven't paid you back for helping me study for my mid-terms. Kousei: Seeing your grades go up was reward enough for me. Mei: Nice try, but I'm paying for you, whether you like it or not! Mei: Now come on, let's go! Kousei: Alright, alright. "

Looks like I'm all out of beer. Mei: Would you like some tea? I haven't drunk directly out of this one yet. Suzune: Sure. By the way, these kelp rolls are delicious. Mei: Hehe. I'll be sure to let my grandma know. Have as many as you want! Suzune: Hey, Kousei! Is it ready yet? I'm already getting full from all these kelp rolls! Kousei: Sorry for the wait. I just finished now. Mei: But you added some kind of smoked ingredient, didn't you? Kousei: You'll see. Go ahead and try it. Suzune: Uh-huh. Mei: ...... Suzune: ...... Mei: Oh? Suzune: Something tastes different. It's a lot more fragrant when I bite into it. Mei: It can't be the bacon, right? Where's this smoky flavor coming from? Suzune: It doesn't seem to be the vegetables, either... What exactly did you do? Kousei: It's the black pepper. That's what I smoked. Mei: Ohh! It's the seasoning! Kousei: Yeah. In a way, black pepper is actually the main ingredient in carbonara. That's where the name of the dish comes from, in fact. Suzune: It's derived from the Italian word for charcoal burner, right? Because there's supposed to be so much pepper on it that it turns black. Kousei: Exactly. I was contemplating whether or not to smoke the salt, but I thought that would change the flavor too much. Kousei: So I decided to smoke the pepper instead. This way it adds a nice kick without destroying the balance of the dish. Suzune: You're right. It really does add a nice kick. It's amazing how a small addition can make such a big difference. Suzune: Even though the seasoning is fundamentally the same, the flavor has a lot more depth. Mei: This is amazing! Just like authentic carbonara! Not that I know what authentic carbonara tastes like, but still! Kousei: Glad you like it. I only just finished smoking the pepper, so the smell might be a little harsh-- Kousei: But as long as I let it sit for a while, it should disappear. Then all I need to do is mix it with some regular black pepper to fine tune the flavor. Suzune: Sounds good. It could use a bit of adjusting, but I definitely think this is good enough to serve to our customers. In all honesty, this really is delicious. Kousei: Thanks. What about you-- Mei: Phew! That was good! Kousei: Wow. Not even a crumb left. Mei: It was too good! Just like real Italian cuisine! Not that I know what real Italian cuisine tastes like, but still! Suzune: You already said that earlier. I get what you're trying to say, though. Kousei: Ahaha... I wasn't expecting this much of a reaction. I'm flattered. Mei: Seriously, it was delicious! You're a genius, Senpai! Kousei: O-Oh stop it... Suzune: Well, since Mei-san is showering you in praise, I'm going to be a little more critical. Suzune: Like you said before, the dish still needs some balancing. Kousei: I know. It's got a pretty strong flavor, so I'm gonna try letting it mellow overnight next time. Suzune: Instead of trying to figure out everything on your own, though, you should ask the others at the cafe to taste-test your dish first. Suzune: Then you can decide if you want to tone it down, or if you actually want to emphasize that distinct flavor. Mei: Ohh, I see! The more unique it tastes, the more likely it is to grab people's interest! Suzune: Exactly. But you might get differing opinions on which one is better, which'll make it harder to decide. Suzune: Still, it's up to you. At the very least, I don't think anyone's going to object to you adding this dish to our menu. Kousei: Alright. I'll give it a shot. Kousei: And thanks, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Huh? Kousei: I wouldn't have come up with this idea without you, so thanks. Mei: Please! All I did was suggest the first thing that came to mind. Mei: Don't underestimate your own genius, Senpai! This really is amazing! Kousei: Th-Thanks. Suzune: Ahem. Kousei: Wh-What? Suzune: We're all out of cheese and sausages, so I'm gonna need you to make me some more. Kousei: You already ate them all? I wanted some too, you know. Suzune: Oh, stop griping. C'mon! Kousei: Alright, alright. Fine. Mei: Senpai! I want to try smoking some other things too! Kousei: Sure. I'll rummage around my fridge and see what else we can toss in the smoker. Mei: This is gonna be great! Kanna: Here's to another great year! Let's all do our best! Suzune: Alrighty. Ready to get back to work? Kousei: Yes, ma'am. Kousei: Not so much changed as added a new twist. I tried smoking the pepper first. Natsume: I can't say it looks or smells particularly different, though... Kousei: You'll see once you try it. Nozomi: Well, I'm gonna go ahead and dig in! Nozomi: That faint hint of smokiness... It's amazing how much difference it makes. Natsume: You said you smoked it yourself? Kousei: Yep. It was all Hiuchidani-san's idea. Mei: Don't be silly. You came up with the idea to smoke the black pepper. Mei: All I did was suggest that we try to make our own bacon. Natsume: Ah. So you spent the break thinking up ways to improve our menu... Natsume: That's very commendable of you. I'm impressed. Kousei: Thanks. How do you think it tastes? Kanna: I, for one, think it's delicious. It gives the dish a lot more added depth. Nozomi: I think so too. This seems like it'd be a real crowd-pleaser. Natsume: It certainly is delicious, but... Kousei: But? Natsume: I feel like the pepper's unique smokiness has a sort of... mature taste to it. Natsume: It's definitely not bad by any means, but--and this is just my personal opinion... Natsume: But I think I actually prefer the regular carbonara. Natsume: So while I'm all for adding this to our menu, I don't think it should replace the original version. Nozomi: You said you added the smoked black pepper to the pasta at the end, right? Kousei: Yeah, I did. Nozomi: In that case, why don't we just serve our regular carbonara with a shaker of smoked black pepper on the side? Nozomi: That way, customers can add as much or as little as they want. Natsume: How would we know how much to prepare in advance, though? Some customers might use a lot more than others. Suzune: A lot of beef bowl restaurants used to do the same thing with their special shichimi spices, but they had to stop the practice a little while back. Suzune: Some customers were using unbelievable amounts of spice, which ended up hurting their profits. Nozomi: Oh... I guess that won't work then. Kanna: It seems like our safest option would be to add this smoked pepper version as a separate item on the menu. Kousei: Alright. So I have all the judges' approval? Kanna: Absolutely. I think this would make a fine addition to our menu. Nozomi: Me too. Natsume: Me three. Kanna: What do you think, Mikado-san? Mikado: I believe Natsume mentioned earlier that this dish had a rather mature taste. However, many of our customers also come here specifically for our coffee and tea. Mikado: Judging from what I have gathered, this would suit their preferences well. Mikado: Therefore, I am in agreement. Kousei: Thank goodness... Mei: Way to go, Senpai! Kousei: Thanks! Kousei: I was just gonna do it at home, actually... Mikado: Among other problems, that would be quite expensive. I would not recommend you do that. Kousei: I guess that's true. Mikado: I do have some other ideas you may wish to consider. Are you free to talk after this? Kousei: Sure. I've got time. Kanna: In that case, let's call it a day here. See you tomorrow, everyone. Natsume: See you tomorrow. Nozomi: See you tomorrow! Kousei: Phew... Kousei: Huh? Hiuchidani-san? Mei: Hey. Kousei: What are you still doing here? Mei: I was waiting for you to finish. Kousei: You could've waited inside. Mei: Ahaha. I didn't want to bother you guys. Mei: Anyway, I know I should've said something earlier... but would you mind walking me home? Kousei: Sure. I don't mind. Let's go. Mei: Thanks! Mei: Congratulations on getting your new recipe approved, by the way. Kousei: Well, you helped with that. Mei: Not at all. You did this on your own, Senpai. Kousei: Nah, it's all thanks to you. I would've never come up with this idea on my own. Kousei: Seriously, thank you. I'm really grateful. Kousei: This might sound kind of melodramatic... but I think I've gained a little more confidence in myself now. Mei: Ehehe... You're gonna make me blush. I don't mean to sound melodramatic either, but, like... Mei: You've done a lot for me as well, Senpai. Ever since you've helped me open up about my left eye, I feel like a huge weight's been lifted off my shoulders. Mei: That's why I wanted to be able to return the favor if I could. Mei: I'm glad I managed to be of some small help to you. Kousei: It wasn't small at all. You were a big help. Kousei: I was hoping to do something like this before I had to deal with my exams, so I'm glad it all went so well. Mei: Oh, your exams are coming up? Kousei: At the end of the month, yeah. Mei: Does that mean you're gonna be working fewer hours? Kousei: No, I'll be working the same as usual. I'll do fine as long as I pay attention in class. Kousei: And I can always study after work too. Mei: You're a pretty diligent student, aren't you? Kousei: I don't know about that... I'm just the sort of guy who hates procrastinating. Mei: That's what it means to be diligent, Senpai. I think that's something to be proud of. Kousei: Nah, trust me... I can be pretty lazy when I want. Mei: But in front of me, at least, you're always hardworking and dependable. Kousei: Okay, sheesh. Stop flattering me. It's gonna go to my head. Mei: Ahaha! Alright. Mei: Well, good night, Senpai. Kousei: Good night. And sorry you had to wait for me earlier. Mei: That's okay. I waited because I wanted to congratulate you. Mei: Anyway, see you tomorrow! Kousei: Yeah. See you tomorrow. Mei: ...... Mei: Hmm... Exams... , Mei: Phew. I thought I was running late, but it looks like you arrived at the same time as me. Kousei: Yeah, I just got out of class. Kousei: Shiki-san and Nozomi should already be here, so let's head inside. Mei: Okay. Mei: Good morning! Kanna: Welcome, you two. Mei: It's a little weird being greeted with a \"Welcome\" when the cafe's closed. Kanna: Then by that logic, saying \"Good morning\" is weird too, no? We're not working. Mei: I guess that's true. Kanna: You're here to study for your exams, right? Natsume-san and Nozomi-san are already here. Kousei: Yeah, sorry. Nozomi: It's fine. You two were in class. Natsume: You don't have to apologize. It's no big deal to us. Kanna: What would everyone like to drink? I'll prepare some refreshments. Nozomi: Huh? But... Kanna: It's no trouble at all. If it'll help you focus on your studies, I'd be happy to help. Nozomi: That's really nice of you. In that case, I'll have a cup of Earl Grey. Mei: Can I get a glass of orange juice? Kanna: Sure. Kanna: What about you two? Natsume: I'll have an Earl Grey too. Kousei: I'll have a coffee. Kanna: Alright. Kousei: Let's get to it then. Did you manage to find the stuff I asked for? Natsume: Here. These were the only ones I had left. Kousei: Thanks. These should help. Natsume: We might be in different majors, but you managed to get into Hitotsuboshi too, so you had to have gotten high grades yourself. Kousei: Well, I had a lot of help, as I'm sure you can imagine. Plus, my grades were only just barely good enough to be accepted. Nozomi: Urgh. These tests are crazy. I can't even figure out this last question with the answer in front of me. Mei: I'm getting a headache just looking at it. Kousei: Yeah, there are quite a few nasty questions in here. Natsume: You can thank my teacher, Saeki-sensei, for that. Apparently, he was a huge math buff. Natsume: Rumor had it he made these questions specifically to be solved using applied mathematics, just to show students the beauty of mathmatics. Nozomi: I'm going to go out on a limb and say he didn't succeed. Natsume: Yeah, most of us couldn't stand his class. Not that we hated him, per se; he was a fine person, just his tests were awful. Mei: That's what I hear too. Kousei: This teacher still teaches there? Mei: Yeah, he sure does. Kousei: Well, these tests should be great reference material then. Kousei: As for the English ones, all these questions seem pretty standard. Natsume: At least when I was there, the only subject that had insanely difficult questions was math. Kousei: Good. Then as long as we use these tests and the textbook to review, you should be able to avoid failing. Natsume: Sounds like a lot of rote memorization, though. Kousei: It'll have to do, for now. There's not enough time for her to re-learn all the material. Mei: Thank you very much. Nozomi: At the moment, I guess I'm struggling with Natsume-san's math questions the most. Nozomi: An in-depth explanation would really help. Natsume: Alright. I'll walk you both through it, so listen up. Nozomi: Okay! Mei: I'm all ears. Mei: Thank you! Nozomi: Sorry for the trouble. And thanks. Natsume: Thank you for doing this, Akizuki-san. Natsume: So anyway--if I apply this formula here, using the value I calculated above, that should give me the answer. Does that make sense? Nozomi: Ahh, I see. Now that you explain it like that, I sort of understand... Maybe... Maybe not? Mei: You're amazing, Nozomi-chan. I still don't get it at all! Natsume: Well, that's no surprise. You're learning from scratch. Natsume: I'll try to explain it as simply as I can, okay? But let me know right away if there's something you don't understand. Mei: Okaaay... *sigh*... Kousei: You're sighing way too much. Natsume: If you're not having any trouble with what I just explained, Sumizome-san, you can go ahead and start studying something else. Nozomi: Well, I wouldn't say I fully understand it yet. Nozomi: Alright, though. Can I borrow your English test? I want to use it to study. Natsume: Be my guest. Mei: Sorry I'm delaying us, Nozomi-san. Nozomi: Hey, it's not a big deal. Nozomi: The whole reason we're having this study session is to learn! Nozomi: So let's work hard and do our best to pass, okay? Mei: Yeah! Kanna: And here's your coffee, Takamine-san. Kousei: Oh, thanks. Kanna: By the way, what are you doing? Kousei: I'm putting together a list of stuff I want to cover. Kanna: Oh, okay. Preparing your teaching materials. Would you like me to help? Kousei: You'd be willing? Kanna: Don't worry. I can at least help you organize everything. Kanna: Everyone's studying their hardest. I want to chip in to help too. Kousei: Alright. Grab a seat. Kanna: Thank you. Nozomi: Kousei-kun, can I ask you something? Kousei: What's up? Nozomi: How come the answer to this one is number two? The other choices sound like they make sense too. Kousei: Hm? Let me see. Ah. Well, if you look at the paragraph before the blank, you can tell whether it's a factual or hypothetical statement. Kousei: The question is asking about something that happened in the past, so the answer has to be number two. Number one is a conjunction, so that wouldn't make sense. See? There's a comma here. Nozomi: Oh, you're right! Urk... Why didn't I catch that? Kousei: It's an easy mistake to make. This whole section can be a little tricky. Kousei: But it's something you need to know. You'll find these sorts of questions on the English proficiency test as well. Nozomi: Really? Alright, thanks. I'd better study it some more then. Kanna: You're actually quite smart, aren't you, Takamine-san? Nozomi: You wouldn't think it, would you? We've known each other for ages, and he always helps me study for tests, but even I still can't believe it sometimes. Nozomi: I never see him cramming at home, so I have no idea how his grades are so good. Kousei: Hey, I put in the effort just like everybody else. Kanna: Is that true? Kousei: The most efficient way to retain information is to pay attention in class. That, and taking notes. Kousei: If I do that, a single glance is all it takes to remember what I learned, which also helps me cut down on review time. Kanna: More haste, less speed, as they say. Nozomi: He's been saying that stuff for years. But if it was that easy to pay attention in class, we wouldn't be asking for help in the first place. Nozomi: Ugh, I can't do this. My concentration is shot. Mei: Me too. It feels like my brain is about to burn out... *sputter* *sputter*... Natsume: Oh, it's getting quite late. Alright. Let's call it a day. Mei: *siiigh* Thank you very much... Nozomi: Thank you! Natsume: You're welcome. So what do you think? Feeling a little more confident now? Mei: Uhh, yeah. I think I understand a bit more now... sort of. Natsume: Ah. Well, I'm glad my explanations made sense to you. Mei: I'll try reviewing everything again once I get home. Natsume: If there's anything you don't understand, let me know. Natsume: Even if it's something we've gone over already, don't be embarrassed. It happens sometimes. Mei: Okay. Thank you for your help. Kousei: Why don't we get you to take the same tests Shiki-san lent us tomorrow? Kousei: After you review the questions you get wrong, you can retake them again the next day. Natsume: I think that's a good idea too. Mei: But, like, won't I just be solving the same questions over and over? Natsume: There's nothing wrong with that. The worst thing would be for you to only think you understand. Kousei: Yeah, the goal here is to make sure you comprehend what you're learning. Kousei: If you can get the same grades Shiki-san did, you should be able to pass your exams without a hitch. But simply memorizing her answers won't mean anything. Mei: Yes, I know. Kousei: Are you okay with that too, Nozomi? Nozomi: Sounds good to me. Natsume: Starting tomorrow, I want you to come in to the cafe even on your days off. Kousei: We'll be able to help you study if you use the break room. Though it'll have to be while we're on the job. Mei: Alright. Thank you kindly. Kanna: Also, take these. I made copies of all your English and Japanese history study materials. Nozomi: Thank you so much! Kousei: Japanese history will largely be pure memorization, but for English, make sure you think about your answers carefully and review them. Mei: I will. Kousei: And thanks for helping out too, Akizuki-san. Kanna: Not at all. Helping people in need is also a part of my job now. Mei: Thanks for everything today. Natsume: Don't thank us just yet. Thank us once you've passed your exams. Mei: True. Alright then! I'll do my best! Nozomi: I'm hooome. Rokurou: Welcome back, Nozomi. Rokurou: Pretty late today, aren't you? I thought you didn't have work on Wednesdays. Nozomi: I was studying with a friend today. Kousei-kun and one of my coworkers were helping us prepare for our mid-terms. Nozomi: I wasn't playing around, so relax. Rokurou: That's not really what I'm worried about... Rokurou: I'm glad to see you working so hard, but make sure you don't overdo it. Rokurou: You've been staying up rather late these days, haven't you? Pulling all-nighters isn't good for your health. Nozomi: I know, geez. That's why I'm doing this now, so I don't have to stay up all night. Nozomi: Anyway, I'm going back to my room to do a bit more review. Rokurou: Don't you want to take a bath? Nozomi: Later. Nozomi: ...... Nozomi: ...... Nozomi: ... Nozomi: Nh... Ngh! Ahh, it's already this late? Nozomi: *sigh*... I studied a whole, whole lot. I've never been able to do this much on my own before. Nozomi: I'd better go take a bath now. If I don't get some sleep soon, I won't be able to wake up on time tomorrow. , Mei: Ah, Senpai! Kousei: Hey. You know, I just realized something after seeing your outfit. Mei: What's that? Kousei: You're on winter break. Mei: Ahaha! Seriously? Why do you think we're meeting up this early in the day? Kousei: True. For some reason, I guess I assumed you'd want to put all this off until after the holidays. Mei: I don't want school getting in the way. Plus, Suzune-san says we're going to be ridiculously busy on Christmas. Kousei: You're working on Christmas? Mei: Yep. I specifically asked to. Kousei: You aren't doing anything with your friends? Mei: Ahaha... Well, they've all got boyfriends, so... Kousei: Ah. Not too surprising then. Mei: You're working Christmas too, aren't you? And Christmas Eve as well, if I recall. Kousei: Yeah. I don't have any plans either, so I figured I might as well. Mei: Sad being single, isn't it? Kousei: Yeah... Mei: Well, not exactly. I recognize her, but I doubt she recognizes me. Mei: Yep. I thought I recognized her from somewhere, so I came here yesterday to double-check. And I was right. Kousei: Didn't take us long to find her, did it? Come to think of it, this is where you and I found out about Yuina's dad too. Mei: Hey, you're right! Maybe this is a lucky place. Kousei: Maybe. Or maybe it's you. Mei: Huh? Me? Kousei: It almost feels like you have a knack for running into people with butterflies or something. Mei: I'm not really sure how to feel about that. Kousei: Sorry. Just a thought. Kousei: Me neither. Mei: Weird. Maybe she isn't the same person? Kousei: Or maybe she already solved her own issues before we could intervene? Mei: I wonder... Hm? Wait, wh-what? Kousei: I see it. Mei: I've never seen anyone's wisps appear and disappear like that. Kousei: What do you mean? Mei: Ah. The guy's back. Kousei: ...... Mei: ...... Kousei: The butterfly's flying away. Mei: You're right. I... can't see the wisp anymore. Kousei: Hmm... Mei: Maybe that man has powers too. Powers like mine. Kousei: The power to repel butterflies, instead of attracting them? It's possible, I guess... Mei: Ah. We probably look really suspicious right now, don't we? Kousei: Huh? Oh, right. Why don't we go over there? Kousei: Hmm. Let's try giving Akizuki-san a call first. Kousei: This could be an unusual case, so we don't want to act rashly. Mei: Okay. Good point! Kanna: Hello? Kousei: This is Takamine. Kanna: Do you need something? Kanna: You said the butterfly disappears whenever this coworker of hers is nearby, correct? Kousei: Yeah. And whenever he leaves, the butterfly comes back. Kousei: Hiuchidani-san thought that maybe the man had some kind of power to repel butterflies... Kanna: *sigh* I didn't think you two were THIS obtuse... Kousei: Come again? Kanna: She's obviously lovestruck. Kousei: What? Sh-She's in love? Kanna: She is. If I had to guess, I'd say that this woman is secretly in love with her coworker. Kousei: She has a crush on him? Wait, really? That's why she's attracting butterflies? Kanna: Hey, don't be so dismissive of the power of love. Kanna: It has the power to incite our deepest, darkest passions. Love inflames the soul, for better or for worse. Kanna: And I would daresay that love is what's thrown that woman's emotions into turmoil. Kanna: She feels happy when they're together, but depressed when they're apart. Kanna: That would explain why the butterfly comes and goes like that. Kousei: I... guess? Kanna: She's probably agonizing over whether or not to confess her feelings to him. Kanna: But if she continues to remain under the butterfly's influence, she may lose hope and decide to give up on him altogether. Kousei: So we should use Hiuchidani-san's powers to capture her butterfly to prevent that from happening? Kanna: To be honest, I'm not entirely sure. If she ends up being rejected anyway, she may become even MORE susceptible to the butterfly's influence. Kanna: I'll leave it up to you to decide what to do, though. And again, please try not to draw unnecessary attention to yourselves. Kousei: I know. Thanks for the help, Akizuki-san. Kousei: Yeah. Apparently, the woman's in love with her coworker, and that's why her emotions are so unstable. Mei: Ohh... Sh-She's in love... That was why! Mei: Th-This feels, like, really embarrassing to say, even though she's a complete stranger... Kousei: It's almost Christmas too. She might be thinking about confessing to him tomorrow or the day after. Mei: Wh-What? Mei: Ngh... Ahh! Kousei: Y-You okay? Mei: I-I'm sorry. I'm just, um, not really used to talking about these sorts of things... Mei: It's getting me a little too worked up... Kousei: Want me to go get you something to drink? Mei: N-No, I'm fine... Kousei: Right. Whenever she's together with him, her spirits temporarily lift, which is why the wisp disappears. Kousei: But when they're apart, she goes back to feeling anxious, which is when the wisp returns. Kousei: Or at least, that's what Akizuki-san's theory is. Mei: Hrmm... Mei: ...... Mei: What if... Kousei: Hm? Mei: What if we do nothing and just let things run their course? Mei: Her wisp already goes away on its own from time to time without me having to make it disappear. Mei: I'm not sure I should be interfering... Kousei: Well... I suppose Akizuki-san DID say the situation wasn't urgent. Kousei: Trust me, you'd know if it was. There'd be a lot more butterflies. Kousei: That woman only has one or two around her at most, so she isn't terribly affected by them. At least, for now. Kousei: Even if we do nothing, it's possible that she'll overcome their influence on her own and confess her feelings. Kousei: But that said, we could still be way off mark. It may have nothing to do with love. Mei: Oh, true... There could be something else that's troubling her. Kousei: From Mikado's point of view, her personal problems aren't really our concern. The important thing is that we catch the butterfly. Mei: Yeah. That's their job, after all. Mei: Then I guess this was our only choice from the start... Mei: It's done. Kousei: Wow. Mei: Huh? Kousei: That was incredible. Beautiful, even. Mei: W-Was it? I can't really tell, myself... Kousei: It definitely looks like she has. Mei: I hope it goes well... Kousei: That's up to her. All we can do is pray that it does. Mei: Yeah. Kousei: If she gets rejected, though... Mei: Hey, don't say that, Senpai. You're gonna jinx it! Kousei: M-My bad. Kousei: Anyway, we've done all we can. The rest is out of our hands. Mei: Alrighty. Mission complete! Kousei: Yep. Not that I actually did anything. Mei: Ahaha! You phoned for help. That counts plenty, I think. Kousei: It'd feel weird to just go home now... Why don't we grab a drink or something? Mei: Good idea! I also want to see if anything happens between those two. Kousei: In that case, how about we get-- Mei: Let's get smoothies! Kousei: Thought you'd say that. Mei: Thanks for paying for me again. Kousei: No problem. It can be your reward for catching the butterfly. Mei: Hehe. You're the best. Mei: By the way, I heard that we're going to be helping bake cakes tomorrow. Kousei: Oh, right. Apparently we received a lot more orders than we expected, so we need all hands on deck. Kousei: Suzune-san wants everyone to pitch in and help. Mei: My shift doesn't start till the afternoon, though. Will I even make it in time to help? Kousei: Suzune-san says we'll be baking them so they're ready just in time for customers to pick up. Kousei: So don't worry. There's gonna be plenty of work to go around. Mei: Alrighty! I don't know if I'll be any good at baking, though... Kousei: You'll probably be put in charge of sales. Mei: Oh, right. I guess we can't have everyone making cakes. Mei: Sounds like it's gonna be a pretty tough day tomorrow. Let's get through this together! Kousei: It'll definitely be busy, but at least we'll get to spend the holidays together with everyone at the cafe. Mei: Ahaha! True that. Mei: Oh, Senpai! Look! Kousei: And it must've gone well. Mei: Yeah! I'm so happy for her. Mei: A Christmas date with her crush... How nice. Kousei: Too bad the only date we have is our jobs. Mei: Urk... Talk about depressing... Kousei: Well, you ready to get going? Mei: Sure. Kousei: We can tell Akizuki-san what happened tomorrow. It's gonna be a busy day, so we should get home early and rest up. Mei: Oh, well I wouldn't mind going to tell her right now, actually! Kousei: You just want to play with Mikado some more, don't you? Mei: Urk... How'd you know? Kousei: It was written all over your face. Mei: Ngh... Can you blame me?! His amazing fluffiness is enough to make anyone go crazy! Mei: Ah. I can be a little too candid sometimes, can't I? I'm sorry. I'll try to be more careful. Kousei: Eh, I don't mind. Feel free to be yourself. I'd prefer that, actually. Mei: Really? Well, please forgive me if I start acting too friendly. Ehehe. Mei: Welp, let's go on home! Kousei: Sounds like a plan. Mei: Let's work real hard tomorrow! Kousei: O-Okay... Kanna: Yes... Nozomi: I-I'll try to hang in there... Kanna: Still, it's not all bad. We wouldn't have gotten such a flood of orders if people didn't love your cakes. Nozomi: Even at my school, there are a ton of kids who are fans of your baking. Suzune: Well, I am a professional. Can't go losing to other restaurants in terms of quality. Suzune: Though... I do apologize for biting off more than I could chew. I knew I should've put a limit on the number of orders. Kousei: But it wasn't an impossible amount. We're nearly there. Kanna: Yeah. Let's hang in there just a little bit longer! Nozomi: Okay! Suzune: You can say that again. I'm exhausted... Natsume: I thought selling cakes would be easier than baking them... Boy, was I wrong. Kousei: I never stepped out of the kitchen today, but there must've been a crazy number of customers. Mei: You wouldn't believe it. We somehow managed to pull through with the three of us, but we could barely keep up. Natsume: Even without counting the people who were here to pick up advance orders, there were a ton of customers who came to buy our regular cakes too... Mei: But even those were flying off the shelves. Natsume: Yeah. I know you guys tried to restock them as fast as you could, but even then they would sell out almost instantly. Suzune: That's probably what I regret the most. Shouldn't have prioritized the advance orders so much. Mikado: Now I understand where the phrase \"selling like hotcakes\" comes from. It's incredible the effect the Christmas holidays have on sales. Kousei: Coming from someone on the kitchen side, you don't know the half of it. Suzune: I mean, they say sales typically go up tenfold on Christmas Eve. Cake stores everywhere are working overtime. Nozomi: Even though Christmas itself is tomorrow, it almost feels like we had more advance orders for today. Suzune: Yep. Christmas Eve is usually the peak in terms of sales. But make no mistake, we'll still be plenty busy tomorrow as well. Natsume: It's an excellent business opportunity, for sure. That said, I'm kind of worried that we're working you too hard, Suzune-san. Suzune: I could say the same for the rest of you. We've gotta strike while the iron's hot, though, so let's keep it up for one more day. Kanna: Agreed. Let's all get a good night's rest so we can be ready for tomorrow. Natsume: See you tomorrow, everyone. Mei & Nozomi: See you all tomorrow! Mei: Y-Yes. Mikado: Mei. Mei: Yes? Mikado: Why are you staring at me with those bloodshot eyes? Mei: I was, um... wondering if you could transform back into your-- Mikado: No. Mei: ...... Kanna: I've never seen anyone's spirits drop that fast. Mikado: Good grief. I am not your pet cat. Mei: You're right. I'm sorry... Mikado: So, what happened after you captured the butterfly? Kousei: She seemed to brighten up considerably. Kousei: And I'm positive that change was due to the influence of Hiuchidani-san's power. Kousei: But assuming we were right about her being lovestruck, she'll most likely become depressed again if she's dumped, so we may have to monitor her situation again if that happens. Kanna: You're sure she didn't notice you two at all? Mei: No. We never got close to her, so I don't think she could've noticed us. Mikado: Even if she had noticed you, I doubt the woman would have linked you to the improvement in her mood. Mikado: The important thing is that you managed to capture the butterfly. Now all that's left is for Mei to learn how to release it. Mei: I'll try my best! Kanna: Just remember to practice only when we're around, and not on your own. Kanna: If you were to accidentally release your butterflies by mistake, there's no telling what effect it could have on the people around you. Mei: Got it! Mikado: You've done well. Make sure you get plenty of rest tonight. Mei: I will! Thank you! Kanna: Have a good night, you two. Kousei: Good night. Mei: Hey, Senpai! You wanna stop by someplace with me? Kousei: I was about to suggest the same thing. You want to go see how that woman's doing, right? Mei: Ahaha. I'm just curious. Mei: I have the feeling she won't be at the store, but it wouldn't hurt to take a look. Kousei: Yeah. Mei: Alright! Let's go. Mei: Hmm... Looks like I was right. Kousei: Guess she isn't here. Mei: She's probably out somewhere with her crush right now. Kousei: Maybe. Probably not here at the mall, though. Mei: Ahaha. Yeah. Who would want to go on a date where they work? Mei: But even if they were here, we wouldn't be able to spot them with how many people there are. Kousei: True. Nothing but Christmas couples as far as the eye can see. Mei: ...... Kousei: Hm? Mei: N-Nothing. It's just... you're a guy and I'm a girl, so... Mei: Other people might think we're a couple too, and that's a little embarrassing... Kousei: You don't want to be seen with me? Ouch... Mei: N-No, that's not what I meant! Kousei: I'm kidding, I'm kidding. You really aren't good with romance and stuff, are you? Mei: I-I'm just not used to it, I guess... Mei: ...... Mei: Say, Senpai... What do you think of me? Kousei: Huh? Wh-Wh-What do you mean? Mei: W-Wait, that came out wrong! I don't mean it like THAT! Mei: I mean, what do you think of me as a person? What kind of impression do you have of me? Kousei: O-Oh, uh, let me think... Mei: Do you think I'm rude, or difficult to approach? Kousei: Oh, no. I've never thought of you as that. Mei: Really? Kousei: Really. If anything, you're the opposite. I've always thought you were very cheery and easy to talk to. Mei: Ah... Thank goodness. I guess I'm doing a good job then... Kousei: What do you mean? Mei: ...... Mei: This might be a little off topic, but... Kousei: I'm listening. Mei: I once told my mom and dad about my eye too. Mei: But they seemed to think I was joking, so they just laughed it off. Mei: Even when I started growing out my bangs, they thought I was just going through my... what'cha call it... my edgy phase? Mei: That's when I realized I wasn't normal, and they didn't understand me. Mei: Ever since then, I stopped talking to people. Mei: It might be a bit dramatic to say I was traumatized by the experience... Mei: But in a way, I sort of was. It's always there, in the back of my mind. Mei: The frustration of not being understood. Mei: The burden of having to hide who I really am. Mei: I know I'm not normal. The truth is, I'm constantly afraid that I'll never fit in with those around me. Kousei: What do you mean? If anything, you're always the center of attention. Kousei: Out of all of us, you're undoubtedly the best at handling customers. Everyone at the cafe relies on you. Mei: Ahaha. Thank you. I appreciate it. Mei: You know, I wish I could work at the cafe forever. Mei: It makes me incredibly happy to know that I finally met other people who completely understand me. Mei: I've never cared much about the Christmas holidays, honestly... Mei: I might not have a boyfriend to spend it with, but at least I got to spend it with people who understand me. Mei: So thank you, Senpai. Mei: Thank you for paying attention to me. Kousei: I'm, er... glad I could help you be yourself. Mei: Absolutely! Kousei: Don't sweat it. I've got a bit of an unusual situation of my own, actually. Kousei: I understand how it feels, not being normal. Mei: You do? Kousei: There's a bit of a problem with my soul, you see. And I'm looking for a way to fix it. Mei: Is there anything I can do to help? Kousei: Well... Mei: Oh. Well, let me know if there's ever anything I can do to help! Kousei: I will. Thanks. Mei: Hey, I've got an idea! Like, this is way off topic, but just hear me out. Kousei: Hm? Mei: Let's go get another smoothie! Kousei: Sure. Guess that's sort of our tradition now, every time we come here. Mei: Ahaha! I guess so! But let me pay for you this time! Kousei: Nah, you don't have to. Mei: Nuh-uh, I am. I still haven't paid you back for helping me study for my mid-terms. Kousei: Seeing your grades go up was reward enough for me. Mei: Nice try, but I'm paying for you, whether you like it or not! Mei: Now come on, let's go! Kousei: Alright, alright. \n\nWhile these examples may provide some guidance, evaluate their relevance to the current conversation.

            "Female Student A: So tell us! Where'd you meet this boyfriend of yours? Female Student B: What do you like about him anyway? Not that I'm trying to say he's bad--I'm just curious. Natsume: Kousei and I work at the same cafe. As for what I like about him... Natsume: Well, I enjoy being with him. Despite how he looks, he can also be pretty manly. But I guess I'd say the thing I like most about him is-- Student C: Is? Natsume: Honestly, I'm not sure. Natsume: But I love him a lot. All Three: Ahhh! Female Student B: Ohmigosh, you're SOOO adorable! Student C: You're head over heels for him, aren't you? Female Student A: So does that mean you're the one who asked him out? Natsume: Hmm. It's kind of hard to say. Technically, he's the one who confessed to me. Natsume: But I did kiss him before that. Student C: You kissed before you even started dating? Whoa, girl! Natsume: W-Well, you know. We were watching the sunrise on New Year's, and I got swept up in the moment... Female Student B: Oh, wow. So you two really haven't been going out for long. Student C: So did you guys do the deed outside after that kiss? Natsume: N-No, we didn't! Female Student B: Are you stupid? It's way too cold around this time of year to be having sex outdoors. Female Student A: So you're saying it'd be fine if it were summertime?! Student C: Sorry, Shiki-san! Are we making you uncomfortable? Natsume: No, not particularly... Female Student B: Wait. Are you still a virgin, by any chance? Female Student A: Oh my gosh! Have a little more tact, will you? Natsume: It's fine... Um, I'm not a virgin anymore. All Three: Whoa! Female Student A: You gotta tell us! How was it? Natsume: W-Well, it hurt. Student C: Not surprising. Natsume: But it felt good too. Female Student B: Really? Student C: Your boyfriend--um, Takamine-kun, was it? Has he been with a lot of other girls before you? Natsume: I doubt it. He said it was his first time too. Female Student B: Y'know, when I lost my virginity, I bled like hell. Female Student A: So the blood part is true? Student C: Wait, are you... Female Student A: Urk... Y-Yeah, I'm still a virgin! So what?! Female Student B: Hey, I never said there was anything wrong with that! Better to stay a virgin than to get impatient, throw it away, and end up with a crappy experience. Student C: Yep. You want your first time to be something memorable. Don't you agree, Shiki-san? Natsume: Huh? O-Oh, yeah. It definitely hurt, but it was a really wonderful experience. All Three: Whoa... Natsume: I-I mean, yeah, I agree--you shouldn't just throw away your virginity. Female Student A: A-Alright. I guess I'll just wait for the right guy to come along. Female Student A: Still, I'm kinda scared. Out of curiosity, how bad does it hurt? Female Student B: It's kinda hard to put into words, honestly. It was like an \"Eek!\" if that makes sense. Student C: For me, it was more like... \"Hngh!\" Female Student A: Pretty bad, I take it... Female Student A: What about you, Shiki-san? Natsume: For me, I guess it was only about an \"Ouch!\"... Female Student B: Lucky you. Female Student A: Is there some way to make it hurt less? Natsume: I have no idea. I'm not exactly an expert myself. Student C: Foreplay's probably the most important thing, don't you think? Student C: Then again, some guys have dicks so big it doesn't matter how wet you are. Female Student B: Yeah. Ultimately, it's gonna depend on your partner. Some guys are way too horny and wanna put it in without any foreplay, for example. Female Student A: What should I do if that happens? Student C: Hmm. You could make him cum once, and hopefully that calms him down some. Female Student A: Yeah, but how? Student C: With a handjob or a blowjob. Female Student A: A handjob? Natsume: A blowjob... Student C: You could also go for a thighjob, or an armpitjob--or get creative and go for a hairjob, a footjob, or even a shoulder-blade-job. Female Student B: Sheesh. You've done it all, haven't you? Wait--shoulder blades?! How does that even work?! Student C: What do you mean? You just--wait a minute. Student C: Are you interested in trying out some of this stuff too, Shiki-san? Natsume: Yesn't. Female Student A: What? Was that a yes or a no? Female Student B: Correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like a yes to me! Natsume: Have a good day. Kanna: Good job today, guys. Natsume: Yeah. You too. Suzune: It's been a while now since New Year's, but how are the numbers looking? Kanna: Thankfully, the number of customers hasn't declined in the slightest. Natsume: In fact, we might be getting even more than before, thanks to your Mont Blanc. Suzune: Wow, really? I'm glad all that effort paid off then. Kousei: Must've been a lot of work. Suzune: Well, y'know. It's not easy steaming chestnuts, hollowing them out, then straining them. And you gotta do everything by hand, otherwise the aroma and the texture just won't be the same. Kousei: Should I start coming to work a bit earlier to help out? Suzune: Wow. I thought you hated waking up early. Kousei: I do, but I can deal with it if you need the help. Suzune: Well, I kinda hate to ask you to... Kousei: Why's that? Suzune: You've seem kind of worn out these past few days, if you know what I mean. Kousei: ...... Kousei: I've, uh... been doing a lot of studying. My finals are coming up. Suzune: Well, as someone who lives in the same apartment building, let me give you a bit of advice. You might want to try keeping your voice down while you're \"studying.\" Kousei: ...... Natsume: Don't look at me, idiot. Her room is way too far away from yours; there's no way she'd be able to hear us. Kousei: Ah... Suzune: Hehehe. Well, all jokes aside. Suzune: I appreciate the offer, but I shouldn't be making other employees do extra work. If there's a problem, it's the system that needs to be improved. Kousei: You say that, but you're the one who always ends up doing the brunt of the work, Suzune-san... Suzune: Well, I guess that's just the price I pay for doing things my way. Either way, I shouldn't be pushing the responsibility onto the part-timers. Suzune: You've got exams coming up, don't you? Are you feeling confident about those? I wouldn't want to be responsible for your graduation being pushed back a year. Kousei: Don't worry. Despite what you may think of me, I do take my classes seriously. Natsume: I'm confident enough that I won't need to do any last-minute cramming either. Suzune: Great. Kanna: Still, let us know if you need time off. We'll do our best to handle things here on our own. Natsume: Thanks. I appreciate it. Kousei: So, where to today? Your place, or mine? Natsume: Hmm. Let's go to your place. I want to warm up under your kotatsu. Kousei: Alright. Kousei: I still have some hotpot ingredients leftover from last time too. Natsume: Sounds good. Let's have that. Kousei: Man, they were delicious. Natsume: If I make them, I'll probably end up making a lot, so let's save it for next time, and invite the others over. Kousei: Alright. Kousei: But speaking of which--what ever happened to that qipao you wore during New Year's? Natsume: What is it with you and your cosplay fetish? Kousei: I'm sorry, but you just looked way too cute in it. Kousei: Not to say that you don't normally look cute, because you do. Every day. Natsume: Alright, fine. I'll wear it for you next time, if I'm in the mood. Natsume: Phew. That was good. Kousei: Yep. Natsume: Here, let me clean up. Kousei: Nah, I'll do it today. Natsume: You sure? Well, how about I make us a cup of coffee or tea then? Kousei: Hmm. I could definitely go for a cup of coffee. Kousei: But all I have is the instant stuff. Natsume: Where is it? Kousei: Oh, it's on that shelf up there. The tea's up there too. Only tea bags, though. Natsume: Nope. I'm just waiting for the tea to steep. Kousei: You have to steep tea bags too? Natsume: You don't have to, but the tea's a lot more fragrant this way. Kousei: Huh. Well, I'll be waiting over here. Natsume: Okay. Kousei: Phew. Sure is cold tonight. Kousei: Rokurou-san did seem pretty happy with how things turned out. Natsume: What's that? Kousei: Nothing. Just talking to myself. Natsume: Oh. Well, here's your coffee. Kousei: Sorry I only have tea bags for you. Natsume: I don't really mind. Anyway, scooch over. I need to warm myself up too. Kousei: O-Oh, uh, okay... Kousei: Not much space, though. Natsume: What, do you want me to move? Kousei: I never said that. Kousei: You just don't, err, initiate this sort of... physical intimacy very often. Kousei: It's usually me who does it. Natsume: The only thing you initiate is se... sex, Kousei. Kousei: I won't deny that. But I do like cuddling like this too. Kousei: Especially when you're the one seeking it, Natsume. Natsume: Only because I love you. Natsume: There's nothing I enjoy more than being with my boyfriend. Being able to feel you right next to me is the most blissful thing ever. Kousei: Same for me. Natsume: I can tell. You've had that goofy grin on your face for a while now. ",
            "Mei: Good morning! Natsume: Good morning. Kanna: Good morning. How was yesterday? Mei: I'm sorry? Natsume: She's talking about your date with Takamine-kun. Mei: My... WHAT? Kanna: You went somewhere together, didn't you? Mei: W-Well, yeah... Natsume: He didn't do anything stupid, did he? Kanna: We were worried that he'd get too carried away and blow his chance. Natsume: Yeah. He seems like the kind of guy to get way too worked up over a date. Mei: Wait, what? What? Suzune: Whoa there. Don't go having this conversation without me! Mei: Ah... Suzune-san. Good morning. Suzune: Good morning. So? You guys were talking about yesterday? Natsume: Yes. Suzune: How was it? How far did you two go? Mei: H-How far? Kanna: Jumping straight into it, are we? Suzune: I know you're just as curious as I am. I mean, they've basically seen each other naked now, no? Mei: WHAT?! Natsume: Wait, really? You've already done THAT? Mei: Oh, no! No, no, no! I mean--WHAT?! Suzune: Okay, maybe that was a bit misleading. I just meant they've seen each other in swimsuits. Mei: A bit?! That was EXTREMELY misleading! Kanna: Oh... so you went swimming? At a hot spring? Mei: We went swimming, yes, but at a pool... Natsume: Really? I didn't know they were already open at this time of year. Suzune: I think she means the big one nearby. It's a heated indoor swimming pool. Natsume: Oh, that sounds like a nice place to go to on a date. Mei: Actually, we went to the one by the station... Suzune: Wait, there's a pool by the station? When did they build that? Natsume: It must have a hot spring built in too. If it's by the station, I should go check it out myself sometime. Mei: Umm... No, it's not that sort of pool. It's a gym... Natsume: What? A gym? Mei: Yes. Like, a fitness center... Kanna: You went to a fitness center together? Mei: Yes... That is indeed where we went. Suzune: Oh. I thought for sure you went to a recreational pool to mess around and have fun. Mei: We just went to do some exercise. Separately... Kanna: Separately? Natsume: That... doesn't sound like much of a date. Suzune: More like a workout, than anything. Kanna: That's rather disappointing... Mei: Wh-What do you mean? It wasn't supposed to be a date! Suzune: Oh, come on. Don't be shy. Mei: I'm telling you, it wasn't a date! Suzune: Psh. That's lame. Mei: H-How? Natsume: A gym, huh? Well, I can certainly see that, coming from you. Mei: ...... Kanna: What's the matter? Mei: No, it's just... I feel a little dumb about the whole thing... Natsume: What for? Mei: The truth is, Senpai thought we were going to a recreational pool as well, but the idea hadn't crossed my mind at all... Suzune: Ahh. So Kousei was the only one who thought it was a date. Mei: N-No, I don't think that's the case... Mei: But still, he was absolutely right. We shouldn't have gone to a fitness center pool... Natsume: Oh, okay. So you wish you'd picked a better place for a date as well. Mei: F-For the last time, it wasn't a date! Kanna: Then allow me to be frank. How do you feel about him? Mei: Who? Kanna: Takamine-san, of course. Mei: Huh? Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What do you mean by that? Natsume: That reaction already says it all. Mei: N-No, I just, um... I have a lot of respect for him. Natsume: Respect? Mei: Y-Yes. Natsume: You... respect him? Kanna: Please don't look so bewildered. I feel bad for him now. Natsume: Sorry. Suzune: You respect him, nothing more? Mei: Huh? Well, um... I guess it's not only that... Mei: But... it's mostly respect... I think... Suzune: Hmm. Suzune: ...... Suzune: Nozomi-san's coming in today, isn't she? Kanna: Yes. Her shift starts at lunch. Suzune: Good. Are you all busy tonight? Natsume: Not particularly. Kanna: I don't have any plans either. Suzune: Well, if Nozomi-san's free as well, let's have a girls' night out! Suzune: Against the four of us, Mei-san doesn't stand a chance. Mei: Wait! What are you going to do to me?! Kanna: That's a great idea. Natsume: Sounds like fun. Mei: What? Huh? Why? Suzune: ...... Mei: Wh-What? Why are you grinning at me like that? Seriously, what? Suzune: Alright! Time to get to work, everybody! Kanna: Let's get down to it! Natsume: I'm looking forward to tonight. Mei: Wait, what? Hold up. Mei: Seriously? Kousei: See you guys later. Natsume: See you. Suzune: Where do you girls want to go? Should we find a restaurant somewhere? Kousei: Oh, are you all going out to eat? Kanna: We're having a girls' night out tonight. Nozomi: I can't wait. *giggle* Mei: ...... Kousei: Is it just me, or is Hiuchidani-san the only one not very excited about it? Natsume: Don't be silly. She's totally excited. Right? Mei: Yes. I am very excited. Kousei: Huh. Could've fooled me. Suzune: Actually, why don't we just go to my place? We'll have a hard time finding any places open this late. Natsume: True. We can just stop by a convenience store on the way and buy something there. Suzune: Alright. Let's get going. Suzune: Oh, and no boys allowed, so go kill some time before you follow us home, Kousei. Kousei: Huh? But if we're all going to the same apartment complex, why can't I just-- Suzune: No can do. Our girls' night out is already underway. Kousei: Fine. Suzune: Come on, girls. Let's go. Nozomi: Okaay. Mei: ...... Kousei: You alright, Hiuchidani-san? Mei: ...... Kousei: I'm gonna take that as a \"no.\" Suzune: Come on, Mei-san. Mei: Okay... Kousei: ...... Kousei: Weird. Suzune: Anyone want a beer? Natsume: I'm fine. Kanna: No, thank you. Suzune: Oh, well. More for me. Nozomi: Uh, so I forgot to ask, but why exactly are we having a girls' night out anyway? Suzune: So we can interrogate Mei-san about her relationship with Kousei. Nozomi: Her relationship with Kousei-kun? Mei: I wanna go home. Suzune: Aww, c'mon. We won't ask you anything too invasive. Just play along with us for tonight. Mei: *sigh*... What do you want to know? Kanna: In all honesty, how do you feel about Takamine-san? Mei: Cutting right to the chase, huh. I already answered that this morning, didn't I? Kanna: You said you respected him, but is that really all there is to it? Mei: I mean... Nozomi: Did something happen between them? Natsume: They went out somewhere together yesterday. Nozomi: Oh, phew. That's not bad... Suzune: What do you mean? Nozomi: I was afraid they'd gotten into a fight or something. Suzune: Oh, no. Just the opposite. They've actually been getting quite chummy lately. Nozomi: Oh, really? Natsume: How do you feel about all this, Sumizome-san? You're his childhood friend. Nozomi: He's never really been popular with girls, so honestly... I think it's great! It feels like my little Kousei-kun is finally growing up! Kanna: It almost sounds like you're talking about him as a brother. Nozomi: Well, we have known each other for a long time. That's just what happens. Kanna: There's your answer. Mei: What? Seriously, what? How do you want me to respond to that? Suzune: Let me be serious with you for a moment. Mei: Um, okay. Suzune: Whenever you have men and women working in the same place, it often presents a unique problem. Mei: Okay? Suzune: See, it's fine if they get along well, but if things turn sour, that can affect the atmosphere of the entire workplace, reducing productivity. Suzune: In order to avoid such things, it's therefore important for me to have a clear understanding of my coworkers' interpersonal relationships. Mei: Oh. I think I get that... Mei: ...... Mei: Did you really need to invite everyone else here for that, though? Suzune: Nope. Mei: What? Suzune: I just thought it'd be funner with more people. Mei: Seriously? Suzune: I won't deny that I'm doing this for amusement, but I also want to support you. Suzune: All you guys feel that way too, right? Natsume: Well, half that, and half out of curiosity. Kanna: I came 100\\% out of curiosity. Nozomi: In that case, I came 100\\% to support you! Suzune: See? Mei: Oh, uh... Thanks? Natsume: To be honest, like Suzune-san said, I want to know how things are going between you two as well--even though it's not really any of my business. Natsume: The cafe is just a really important place to me, so I'd hate for there to be any problems caused by interpersonal relationships. Natsume: Maybe I'm just a cynic, but I feel like it's all too easy for office romances to lead to those sorts of conflicts. Mei: Romance? Umm... I had a feeling that's where this was going, but, like... Natsume: Am I wrong? Mei: I don't think things between me and him are... like that. Kanna: You don't sound very confident. Mei: I mean, I don't have any experience with relationships, so I don't really know... Suzune: It definitely seems like you've got chemistry, though. From what I've seen, at least. Mei: Chemistry? Kanna: I agree. You become much more animated when you're talking with Takamine-san compared to when you talk with us. Mei: I-Is that true? I've never realized that myself... Natsume: I'd go so far as to say your eyes start to sparkle... maybe? Well, you get the idea. Suzune: You always go \"Senpai, Senpai!\" in such a cheerful voice. Whenever you're with Kousei, you seem even more upbeat than usual. Mei: What? Seriously? Natsume: What do you think, Sumizome-san? Have you noticed any recent changes in Takamine-kun's behavior? Nozomi: Hmm... I don't know. They definitely get along well, that's for sure. Nozomi: Ah--but I guess he seems a lot more... relaxed whenever he's around Mei-chan. Compared to Natsume-san and Kanna-san, for example. Natsume: True. He won't even sit beside me in class. Nozomi: Not a surprise. He's not really used to dealing with girls. Nozomi: But when he's with Mei-chan, I feel like he's more comfortable acting natural. Natsume: Hmm. I guess part of it might have to do with her being younger. Suzune: Not all the time, though. Yesterday he was all restless and fidgety. Mei: What? He was? Suzune: Yep. He was having a bit of trouble concentrating on work. Suzune: It made me smile, but he also kind of needed to get his act together. Suzune: So in all seriousness, the sooner you two sort out your feelings, the happier I'll be. Mei: Urk... Easier said than done... Kanna: It's almost Valentine's Day too. The timing couldn't be better. Nozomi: Oh, Valentine's Day! Are we doing anything special at the cafe? Natsume: Hopefully. Suzune-san and I are still figuring out what, though. Suzune: We'll probably do another limited-time special like we did on Christmas. I doubt it'll be as hectic this time around, though. Nozomi: True. People don't usually buy their Valentine's chocolates from cake shops. Suzune: If only chocolate had a longer shelf life. But yeah, that's why it's just going to be a limited-time thing, for girls to buy for their acquaintances and such. Suzune: You know, friend-chocolate. Kanna: Oh, that's right! I nearly forgot to ask. What should we do about OUR chocolates? Natsume: You mean for Takamine-kun? Kanna: Yes. And Mikado-san too. I wasn't sure if we should give our male coworkers chocolates. Nozomi: Why don't we give them one big gift, from all of us? That way it'll be easier for them to prepare a return gift too, as opposed to having to buy a gift for each of us individually. Natsume: Good idea. He'd probably be disappointed if we didn't get him anything. Suzune: In that case, Mei-san can get him something a little more personal. Mei: Gosh, why do we keep going here? Suzune: Well, it's either that or you pitch in with the rest of us. Which do you want? Mei: Well... I mean... Urk... Suzune: See? You don't want to, do you? Mei: Well, I mean... he does a lot for me, so, like... Mei: If I'm going to give him something... I want it to be from ME. Natsume: That's the only reason? Mei: Urk... Kanna: Oh? You're not denying it. Mei: I don't know what you want me to say... Mei: Ngh! Mei: I really don't know. I mean, I do l-like him, of course... Mei: But I just like him as a person... I don't know if that means I l-love him or not. Suzune: Ahhh! So adorbs! My heart can't take it! Natsume: God, what's gotten into you? Are you drunk? Suzune: A little. Kanna: Let me ask you this then. If Takamine-san started getting chummy with another girl, how would that make you feel? Mei: Hmm... Natsume: Out of all of us, I'd say he's closest to Sumizome-san, right? Nozomi: I guess, considering how long we've known each other. Suzune: Do you ever feel like there's a side of him only you know about? Nozomi: Something only I know? Let me think... Nozomi: His face when he wakes up, I guess? Kanna: You're not talking about what I think you are, are you? Nozomi: No, not like that. He gets up early by himself now, but I used to have to come over every morning to wake him up. Suzune: Ahh. I have a younger brother too, so I know what that's like. He'd always whine and yell when I yanked off his covers. Nozomi: Yeah... I once made the mistake of doing that too... Natsume: Why was it a mistake? Nozomi: You know how in the morning, guys get... um, you know... Suzune: Morning wood? Nozomi: Oh my god! You just outright said it! Mei: Morning what? Suzune: It's when guys get an uncontrollable erection in the morning. Mei: ...... Mei: Ahh! Suzune: Gee, what an adorable reaction. Nozomi-san, on the other hand, seems like she's pretty used to it. Nozomi: I wouldn't really say that. I've just happened to see it a few times, is all... Suzune: Oh-ho. So you've seen his erect ding-a-ling \"a few times,\" have you now? Natsume: His what? Kanna: She's definitely drunk, alright. Nozomi: I-It wasn't on purpose or anything, okay? It just happened on rare occasions when I came to wake him up... Suzune: Well, how does it feel knowing another woman's seen his, um... his wing-dang-doodle, Mei-san? Natsume: Excuse me? Kanna: You're a terrible drunk, Suzune-san. Suzune: Go ahead and tell us. Another woman's seen his private parts. How does that make you feel? Mei: Urk... Mei: Ngh... Mei: Nghhh! Mei: ...... Mei: It makes me feel... a little put out... I guess. Suzune: So you do have some feelings for him, deep down. Mei: Urk... I don't know... Suzune: Well, if you're planning to make him some homemade chocolate, let me know. I'll teach you everything you need to know. Mei: Homemade? But that'd totally make it seem like I... you know. Natsume: Like you're confessing to him, right. Mei: He might think I'm being too clingy, though... Nozomi: I don't know about that. I think he'd be thrilled. Suzune: So what do you say? Wanna make some homemade chocolate? Mei: Homemade chocolate... to confess my feelings... Homemade chocolate... Mei: Urk... Nghhhh! Mei: Ngh. Nozomi: M-Mei-chan? Natsume: She collapsed. Kanna: Her face is red as a beet too. Mei: I can't think straight anymore... My head's about to explode... Suzune: Aww, look at her. Acting all flustered like a young girl in love. Natsume: I feel like it's mostly your fault she's like this. Suzune: Sorry, she's just too cute. I can't help but tease her. Mei: Please, just let me go home already... I'm really not good with these sorts of conversations... Kanna: I know I said I only came because I was curious, but if you really are planning to confess to Takamine-san, I'll be glad to assist in any way I can. Kanna: I'd love for you two to be happily together. Nozomi: Me too! Let me know if there's anything I can do. Natsume: Alright. I think it's time we put this conversation to rest. It doesn't look like Hiuchidani-san can take much more. Mei: I can't... I'm about to die from embarrassment... Suzune: Man, what I wouldn't give to be young again... Kanna: What are you talking about? You're still plenty young. Suzune: There's a world of difference between being a student and being a working adult. Suzune: Time'll pass by before you know it, Mei-san. Make sure you don't leave any regrets behind. Mei: Urk... Alright. I'll try to think about how I really feel... Suzune: Honestly, though, it's already pretty clear to the rest of us. Kanna: That's just how love works. The person themselves can oftentimes be oblivious to the fact. Natsume: Very true. Nozomi: You three talk like you know a lot. You must have a ton of dating experience, huh? All Three: ...... Nozomi: Why did you all look away? Do you... not? Natsume: Anyway, why don't we start discussing our Valentine's Day menu? Suzune: Sounds like a great idea! Kanna: Indeed! Nozomi: Oops... I guess I shouldn't have asked. Mei: Urk... Mei: Do I really like him... that way? Mei: ...... Mei: Urk... I don't know! Ngh! Mei: G-Good morning! Kousei: What did you do to her yesterday? Suzune: Nothing. We just had a little chat. Kousei: ...... Suzune: Why are you giving me that look? Kousei: Because she's clearly acting weird. Suzune: Well, it's obvious why... Suzune: ...... Kousei: What do you mean? Suzune: Well, maybe I do owe her an apology. Kousei: What? Suzune: I might've teased her a little too much. Kousei: Huh? Suzune: Well, thankfully, we might see some progress now. Kousei: What progress? Suzune: You'll see soon enough. And you'd better thank me when it happens. Kousei: When what happens? Suzune: Uh-oh. Our orders are starting to pile up. Better get back to work. Kanna: Actually, Takamine-san, could I ask you and Mei-san to stay behind for a little while? Mei: Huh? Suzune: Hold on. What are you doing? Kanna: This doesn't have anything to do with what we discussed yesterday. I just need to talk to them about their shifts. Suzune: Oh, okay. Suzune: Well, see you all tomorrow! Natsume: Bye, everyone. Kanna: No, of course not. Kousei: I thought so. This is about Hiuchidani-san's eye, isn't it? Mikado: Yes, indeed. Mei: I forgot to ask before, but does anyone at the cafe else know about my eye? Mikado: Natsume knows. Suzune and Nozomi do not, however. Mei: Natsume-san san knows too? That's a relief. Kanna: Still, I must advise you not to speak with her about it too carelessly. We wouldn't want anyone overhearing you by accident. Mei: Alright. Mikado: How are things going with your eye? Mei: Nothing much has changed. Mikado: Which means you haven't found a way to release your butterflies yet? Mei: Err... No, not yet. Kanna: We haven't had many opportunities to practice, after all. Would you like to do some now? Mei: Sure. Mei: But that being said... Mikado: You said you are able to capture butterflies simply by staring at them, correct? Mei: Yeah. After I stare at them for a while, they just disappear. Kanna: In that case, perhaps you could do the opposite, and try staring at an empty space while imagining them appearing. Mei: Imagine them appearing? Mei: Nghhh... Mei: ...... Mei: It's not working. Kousei: What about other people who had the eye? How did they release their butterflies? Mikado: Well, if we knew that, we would not be having this problem. Kousei: Good point. But haven't any other Grim Reapers documented it? Kanna: We've tried searching for more information, but no such luck. Kanna: And to the best of my knowledge, Mei-san is the only person who possesses the eye yet can't see the butterflies. Kousei: So she's an anomaly? Mikado: We don't know that either. People who possess the eye are rare enough in and of themselves. There is simply not enough information. Mikado: That is precisely what makes her such an interesting case study. Kousei: You make her sound like some kind of guinea pig... Mei: That's okay. I want to find out everything I can about my eye as well. Mei: If anything, I should be the one apologizing for being so unhelpful... Kanna: If only I could use my scythe to retrieve the butterflies from your eye... Kousei: You can't? Kanna: I don't dare try. It could end up causing unforeseen damage to Mei-san's soul. Kanna: Perhaps if I knew exactly where the butterflies were located, I might be able to do something about it, but I don't. Mikado: We are no longer able to sense butterflies that have been captured by the eye. Mikado: That is why we did not realize that Mei possessed the eye in the first place. Kousei: Interesting. Kanna: I just had an idea, Mei-san. Mei: Yes? Kanna: Whenever you capture butterflies, is there anything in particular that you think of? Mei: Something I think of? Hmm... I'm not really sure... Kanna: So you do it without thinking? Mei: Well... I guess I think to myself, \"Go away!\" or something like that. Mei: But the very first time I ever noticed a wisp... Mei: ...... Mei: I was mostly just curious. \"What is that?\" I thought, and so I kept staring at it until it disappeared. Mei: That's what crossed my mind the first time it happened, at least. Kanna: Just curiosity... Kousei: So then if she does the opposite, and tries NOT to think about the butterflies, she'll be able to release them? Mikado: You realize that, until just recently, she had no idea that there were even butterflies inside her? Kousei: Oh, right. I guess she hasn't been thinking about them this whole time. I wonder what it is she needs then? Kanna: Maybe what she needs is... something more concrete. Mei: What do you mean? Kanna: If, by thinking about \"butterflies\", you are able to capture them... Kanna: Then perhaps by focusing your thoughts on a specific \"place\", you'll be able to release them. Mei: Oh. So instead of just vaguely trying to release them anywhere, I should try to think about releasing them towards someplace specific? Kanna: Why don't you give it a shot? Mei: Alrighty! Mei: Ngh... Mei: Nghh! Mei: C'mon, the chair... The chair! Mei: Nggghhhhh! Mikado: It doesn't seem to be working. Mei: I'm sorry... Kanna: Maybe you aren't focusing hard enough... or maybe I'm just completely wrong. Kanna: Hmm... Kanna: Your Excellency. Mikado: Yes? Kanna: Please turn into your cat form. Mikado: I beg your pardon? Kanna: Please turn into your cat form. Mikado: I refuse. Kanna: Please turn into your cat form. Mikado: You can repeat yourself however many times you wish, but no means no! Kanna: Please! I'm sure this will work! Remember that Mei-san has an abnormal fixation with cats. Mikado: I will not! Mei: A-Abnormal fixation? That's mean... Kousei: Well... she's not wrong. Mei: You too, Senpai?! Kousei: I mean... you turn pretty crazy whenever you see a cat. Kanna: To put it bluntly, you turn into a complete maniac. Mei: W-Wow! You're so mean! Kanna: We've got nothing to lose by trying. Please, Your Excellency! This is for Mei-san's sake! Mikado: Kgh... Very well. But you had best keep yourself under control this time, Mei. Mei: Don't worry! I will, I promise! Mikado: I do not believe you! Kanna: Please, Your Excellency. Hurry it up! Mikado: Fine... Have your wish! Mei: Ahhhhhhh! Mikado: Mei! Have you already forgotten your promise?! Mei: R-R-Relax! I-I'm fine! I-I'm completely calm! Kousei: That look in your eyes begs to differ... Kanna: This is just a guess... but Mei-san seems like the kind of person stray cats run from. Mei: How did you know? It's true; even cats that are used to people always run away from me! I wonder why? Mikado: Is it not painfully obvious? Kanna: Now then, Mei-san. Please try imagining your butterflies being released around His Excellency. Mei: R-Right! A-Around His Excellency! Y-Yes! O-Of course! Mikado: I do not wish to be rude, Mei, but I find your behavior most repulsive right now. Kousei: That's about as rude as it gets, though. Mei: I don't mind! He can call me repulsive as much as he wants! Kousei: You've got problems, Hiuchidani-san. Seriously. Mei: A-Anyway, here I go! Mikado: Very well. But you can do it standing from there. Do not come any closer, you hear? Mei: A-Alright! *pant*... *pant*... Mikado: ...... Mei: *pant*... *pant*! Mikado: Why are you breathing so heavily? Mei: *PANT*... *PANT*! Mikado: Enough! If this goes on any further, I will not be safe! Mei: *PAAAANT*! Kanna: Alright, Mei-san. Settle down, settle down. Mei: Huh? It's over? My time's up already? Wait! How much do I have to pay for an extension?! Mikado: What on earth is this child talking about? Kousei: Well, I guess that didn't work either. Kanna: My idea must've been wrong. I suppose we'll have to think this over some more. Mei: Five thousand yen! I'll pay five thousand yen! Mikado: That is quite enough. Playtime is over. Mei: Ahh... He's gone... Mikado: Good grief. I am beginning to suspect that this derangement of yours is a side effect of using your eye... Mei: What do you mean? I was totally calm and collected. Kousei: ...... Kanna: ...... Mikado: I believe you have something to say to me, Mei. Mei: Okay, fine! I'm sorry! Kanna: Anyway, why don't we stop here for today? Mikado: Before we do, though, I must ask. Have you captured any other butterflies lately besides the ones in the cafe? Mei: No. I haven't used my powers at all outside of the cafe. Mikado: Alright. Very well. Kanna: If that's all, then we'll see you-- Mei: Actually, can I ask one more thing? Mikado: Yes? Mei: Is it possible that using my eye... could have a negative effect on the person? Kanna: You mean when you use it to capture butterflies? Mei: Yeah. You said that it had the power to heal people's souls, but, um... how do I put this... Kousei: For example, if a person's soul was weakened because of a physical problem, healing their soul wouldn't resolve the underlying issue. Kousei: On the contrary, healing only their soul might have a negative effect on their body. Kousei: I think that's what Hiuchidani-san means to say. Mei: R-Right. That's it. Thank you. Mikado: Hmm... It is difficult to say for certain. Mei: In that case, isn't it kind of risky for me to be using my eye on our customers? Mikado: Perhaps. But it is also better than doing nothing. Mikado: There have been no instances of any customers returning to the cafe with new butterflies after you captured their old ones. Mikado: As of this moment, we have no reason to believe that the power of your eye has any negative effect on others. Mei: Oh... Kanna: Did something happen that caused you to think that it might? Mei: N-No, not exactly... Mei: ...... Mei: It's just... I feel like I've been getting a little carried away ever since I learned the truth about my eye, and learned that there were other people that understood me. Mei: If it turns out that my eye is causing others harm, though... I'd rather just stop using it altogether. Mikado: It is I who tasked you with capturing other people's butterflies. If there truly are any negative consequences of doing so, it would be my responsibility to bear. Mikado: So do not worry. Thanks to you, our job of collecting butterflies has been going remarkably smoothly. That is a fact. Mei: Okay. Thank you for saying that. Kanna: Are there any other questions you'd like to ask? Mei: No, that's all. Kanna: In that case, I'll see you both tomorrow. Good night. Mikado: Good night. Make sure you get plenty of rest. Mei: We will. Good night! Kousei: Good night. Kanna: ...... Mikado: Are you still worried? Kanna: I'm a little relieved, actually, knowing that Mei-san has her own reservations about using her eye. Mikado: I've never been worried about that myself. Despite appearances, she is a very rational-- Mikado: ...... Kanna: Struggling to finish that sentence, aren't you? Mikado: Allow me to rephrase. Although she tends to lose her head under certain circumstances, she is generally a very compassionate person. Mikado: She is the sort of person who would never even think about abusing the power of her eye. Kanna: I'm not worried about that either. I trust Mei-san completely. Kanna: What worries me is... something else. Mikado: We've already warned her many times not to let anyone realize the truth about her eye. Kanna: I know. Of course, times have changed now, but still... Mikado: People's hearts remain largely the same. Kanna: That's why I was against using her eye in the first place. Kanna: There may not be any problems right now, but if things start to fall apart, Mei-san will be the one to suffer. Kanna: And all the positive influence she's been having on Takamine-san's soul will be for naught. Kanna: If anything were to happen to Mei-san, Takamine-san would undoubtedly be greatly affected as well. Mikado: Hmm. So it is not Mei, but Takamine Kousei you are worried about? Kanna: I'm worried about them both. But... I realize I may just be feeling overprotective. Kanna: If you wish for her to have full control over the power of her eye, I won't object. Rest assured. Mikado: I understand that you are concerned, but we cannot allow these butterflies to simply remain inside of Mei either. Kanna: I know. Mikado: Incidentally, Kanna. Kanna: Yes? Mikado: What exactly was it that you and Mei spoke about yesterday? I understand you and the others had a \"girls' night out.\" Kanna: Tsk, tsk. How rude, Your Excellency. You mustn't ask a young lady to divulge her secrets. Mikado: Ah. So it was nothing of importance then. Kanna: Nihihi. Nope. Just a little gossip between girls, is all. Kanna: I do hope everything works out between those two, though... Mei: Oh... yeah. It's been weighing on my mind for a while now. Mei: The truth is, I've been getting a little carried away ever since His Excellency gave me this task. Mei: I'm worried that I've only been adding to people's troubles, like I did to her. Mei: I was starting to question whether capturing our customer's wisps was the right thing to do. Kousei: Hmm... It's hard to say. Mei: Yeah. It is. Kousei: But you know, I've been thinking as well. Kousei: I suggested that maybe this friend of yours had a physical problem, and that's why she still hasn't gotten better. Kousei: But after you'd cast your \"magic spell\" on her, you saw a significant improvement in her mood, didn't you? Mei: Yeah. While I wouldn't say she recovered completely, there was definitely a big improvement. Kousei: If that's true, then it must be some sort of emotional problem. That's why the power of your eye was able to cheer her up temporarily. Kousei: And in that case, there's no doubt in my mind that your \"magic spell\" provided her with some much-needed relief. Kousei: While it's unfortunate that she ended up becoming overly dependent on it, it's clear that the weight in your friend's heart was lightened because of you. Kousei: If I had to say whether it was the right or wrong decision, I'd have to say it was right. Kousei: So I don't think there's anything you should feel guilty or anxious about. Kousei: The power in your left eye is unmistakably a power that helps others. And I'm certain it'll help a lot more people from now on. Mei: ...... Kousei: Uh... sorry. Maybe it's not my place to say anything. Mei: N-No, don't apologize... Mei: ...... Mei: C-Can you read my mind, Senpai? Kousei: Huh? Mei: It makes me really happy... You always seem to know exactly what I want to hear. Mei: It almost feels like you know exactly what I'm thinking all the time. Kousei: Nah... I'm not that sensitive, to be honest. In fact, I can be downright insensitive sometimes. Kousei: But one thing I will say is that I'm not saying these things just to cheer you up. Kousei: I mean it. All of it. Kousei: The stuff about me being grateful to you, and the stuff about your eye--you, helping other people. Kousei: I mean all of it, from the bottom of my heart. Kousei: And if I managed to get that message across to you, well... then that'd make me happy too. Mei: ...... Kousei: Sorry if I seem like I'm trying too hard to be cool or something. I'm lame, I know. Mei: N-No! You're really not... Mei: ...... Mei: U-Umm! Kousei: Hm? Mei: Do you like sweets, Senpai? Kousei: Huh? What's this about? Mei: Do you? Kousei: Well, sure, I guess. Mei: Okay, great! Good night! Kousei: Huh? O-Oh. Yeah, g'night. Mei: Thanks for walking me home! See you tomorrow! Kousei: R-Right. See you tomorrow... Mei: ...... Mei: Hi, Suzune-san? It's me, Mei. I'm sorry for the random call... Mei: Um, I was wondering something... Mei: ...... Mei: C-Could you teach me how to make my own chocolate? ",
            "Somei: I'll try to be more positive. I feel like people tend to worry too much about contacting old friends, only to find out it's no big deal once they actually do it. Kousei: True. Somei: Don't you have to get back to work, though? Kousei: Oh, crap! I forgot! Somei: Speaking of the cafe, I wouldn't say no to a slice of cake next time you visit! Kousei: Well, I guess. But I thought you were about to be discharged soon? Somei: Yeah, I am. Kousei: In that case, you might as well come by the cafe yourself. Somei: Ahh, sure. I'll think about it. Kousei: By the way, do you think I could get your phone number? Somei: Oh-ho! And you said you're not a cheater. She's not gonna be happy to hear this! Kousei: Please don't joke about that. She can be seriously scary when she gets mad. Somei: Why do you want my number then? Oh, are you gonna introduce me to one of your guy friends? Kousei: Hmm. Well, if you're serious, I guess I could introduce you to one of my college buddies. Somei: Wait. Seriously? Kousei: Sure, it's not that big of a deal. Kousei: I won't ask you to do anything for me in return... but maybe you'd be willing to give me some advice? Natsume: How does kissing feel so good? All we're doing is putting our lips together... Natsume: If this is what kissing feels like, then... Female Nurse: Oh? Has your boyfriend already left? Natsume: He came here during his break at work, so he couldn't stay long. Female Nurse: You're a lucky girl. Not many guys would come see their girlfriend every day of the week. Natsume: ...... Female Nurse: Oh, no need to blush. Female Nurse: There's no reason a pretty girl like you shouldn't have a man or two around her arm. You might not think it, but I was quite the playgirl back in my younger days. Natsume: I'm fine with just the one, actually. Female Nurse: Oh, you're more pure-hearted than I expected. Natsume: Anyway, um... there's something I'd like to ask. Female Nurse: What's that? Natsume: If I leave the hospital tomorrow as scheduled, will I be able to go back to my life as usual? Female Nurse: Well, yes. Natsume: So I should be able to take hot baths, and engage in a bit of... ph-physical activity? Female Nurse: That shouldn't be a problem. But it'll also depend on what kind of physical activity you... Female Nurse: Ahh. So THAT'S what you mean. Female Nurse: Most girls your age are interested in those things, all the more so if they have a boyfriend. Heck, back in my younger days, I-- Natsume: Ngh! Female Nurse: Well, maybe another time. But I get it--you can't exactly ask Dr. Miyama a question like that. Alright. I'll try to ask him for you as discreetly as I can. Natsume: I'd, um, appreciate that... Female Nurse: Oh, how I wish I was young like you again. Kousei: ...... Suzune: Try relaxing a bit more, will you? Kousei: Easier said than done. I can't help but worry. Kanna: Did the tests come back okay? Kousei: Yeah, that's what she texted me. Said she was clear to be discharged today. Suzune: Alright. The caprese-style pasta's ready to go out. Kanna: I'll take it. Kanna: Here is your caprese-style pasta. I'll bring you your sachertorte and blend coffee once you've finished. Kanna: Please, enjoy your meal. Mikado: Welcome to Cafe Stella. Hm? Ah, if it isn't Shiki Natsume. Natsume: Hello. Mei: Huh? Oh, it's Natsume-senpai! Welcome back! Nozomi: Welcome back! Natsume: Oh, I didn't know you two were working today. Nozomi: They needed some extra help till you got back. Mei: Plus, we wanted to be here to see you! Boy, I ran here as fast as I could once school let out. Natsume: Ah. Thanks for doing that. Mei: Oh, you don't have to thank us for that! Ahaha. Mei: We've missed you a whole lot this past week. Nozomi: Since they let you out, does that mean you're all good to go now? Natsume: Yeah. I'm fine. Nozomi: Are you sure? You weren't in the hospital for as long as I thought you'd be. Kanna: Health and sickness start with the mind, after all. I'm sure those daily visits from a certain somebody did wonders to speed her recovery. Nozomi & Mei: Ahh. Natsume: You didn't have to say that out loud. Kanna: Welcome back, Natsume-san. Mikado: Welcome back. Natsume: Thanks. I'll be able to get back to work by tomorrow. Mei: What? So soon? You can rest up a little longer, if you need to. Nozomi: Yeah. If you need any help settling back into things, just ask! We're all here for you! Natsume: I will. Thank you, everyone. Kanna: But that's enough about work. You're here as a customer today, aren't you? Mei: Table for one, Miss? Suzune: Ah, look who it is. I had a feeling that's what all the commotion was about. Suzune: Welcome back, Natsume-san. Natsume: Mhm. I'm glad to be back. Kousei: Make it non-alcoholic, please. Bartender: Certainly. Kousei: You okay after all that? I'm surprised you don't have heartburn. Natsume: A small price to pay. Humans can't live without eating good food. Kousei: You seem like you're in a good mood. Natsume: Maybe it's because I just got out of the hospital, but everything tasted so delicious. Kousei: Because... of me? Natsume: Nope. Not quite. Natsume: Not just because of you, but because of everyone. Kousei: You mean everyone at the cafe? Natsume: Yeah. I don't want to sound like I'm still hung up on this, though. Kousei: Don't worry. I'm here to listen. Natsume: See, years ago, whenever I was released from the hospital... people would always stare at me from a distance. Natsume: They didn't exactly treat me like I was helpless, but they always seemed confused, like they didn't know what to say to me. Natsume: And that's why... Bartender: Here you are, ma'am. Kousei: Stop joking about that. Kousei: If it turns out there's actually alcohol in there, I'm going to start worrying about you again. Natsume: Okay, okay. Sorry. I'll stop for today. Kousei: Alright. Let's get you home now. Natsume: ...... Kousei: Natsume? Natsume: Nothing... Kousei: Okay? Kousei: Oh, yeah. Finals are coming up. You feeling confident? You've been pretty busy lately, so you probably haven't had much time to study. Natsume: Well, I'm sure I'll manage. Kousei: Why don't we study together sometime for the class we share? Natsume: Sure. I don't mind. Kousei: ...... Natsume: ...... Kousei: ...... Kousei: What's the matter? Kousei: ...... Kousei: Haha, very funny. I thought I told you to stop joking ar-- Natsume: I'm not joking. And I'm not drunk either. Kousei: ...... Natsume: I want to stay with you... a bit longer... Kousei: Ah, er, sorry. Yeah... Kousei: I just never expected this, so my mind's kinda going haywire right now. So, um... Kousei: Alright. Kousei: I want to be with you too, Natsume. Kousei: *pant*... *pant*... Kousei: ...... Kousei: Nghhh! Kousei: *inhale*... *exhale*... *inhale*... *exhale*... *inhale*... Kousei: %123;*choke*?! Kousei: Er, no. 'Course not. Kousei: *inhale*... *exhale*... Kousei: You look really sexy. Natsume: Ngh... Kousei: Err, sorry. That was supposed to be a compliment. Y-You're not mad, are you? Natsume: No, I'm not. It's just... incredibly embarrassing. Kousei: You really look beautiful, though. Positively stunning. I'm getting turned on just looking at you. Kousei: My bad. Kousei: But, err, instead of that... Kousei: Can I... touch you? Natsume: Are you really going to ask me that now? Take a hint. Kousei: Yeah. Sorry. Natsume: It's my first time, so we need to do a bit more foreplay first. You know, kissing, stuff like that... Kousei: R-Right. Sorry. Kissing... Nhh... Natsume: I wasn't saying for you to kiss me down THERE! Kousei: Huh? Natsume: Why are you surprised?! Is this really news to you?! There's an order to this stuff! Kousei: O-Oh. Sorry. You're right. First things first. Kousei: Please tell me your name and age. Natsume: What am I, interviewing for the casting couch? Natsume: Oh, for crying out loud. You totally ruined the mood now. Natsume: I hope you know how humiliating this is for me. Kousei: I'm sorry. I mean it. I apologize. Kousei: But you gotta understand; this is my first time too! I'm freaking out here! Natsume: Then make it up to me. Nhh... Natsume: Nhhh... Nh, mh... Nhh... Ah... That's the first time. Kousei: Huh? Natsume: The first time you've ever initiated a kiss. Kousei: Yeah, I guess so. Kousei: I'd better pay you back for all the times you've kissed me then... Nhh... Natsume: Ahmph... Hngh... *smack* *kiss*... Nhh... Nh... *kiss* *smooch*... Mhh... Kousei: No, they're perfect. And... super soft. Natsume: Ahh, nhh... Hngh... Nhhh... Kousei: Besides, it doesn't matter whether they're big or small. I don't care about size. Natsume: Is that supposed to be a compliment? Kousei: I dunno, to be honest. I think your boobs might be hypnotizing me. Kousei: They're so soft... and your nipples are such a beautiful pink too... It's really turning me on. Natsume: Well, um, I'm glad to hear it. Kousei: ...... Natsume: Stop staring at me in silence, will you? It's embarrassing. Kousei: Sorry, I didn't mean to. Kousei: *lick* *suck*... Your nipples are delicious, Natsume... Natsume: *pant* *pant*... It didn't hurt... Nhh... *pant*... Natsume: I just didn't expect it to feel this electrifying... *pant*... *pant*... Natsume: What's going to happen to me... if we go even further? Kousei: I don't know either. Kousei: But... I'm past the point of return. Kousei: It's... so pretty... Kousei: Well, I need to get a good look. Kousei: Don't wanna put it in the wrong hole, y'know... Natsume: Yeah, but... It doesn't look weird, does it? Kousei: It's beautiful. Seriously. That's the only word that comes to mind. Kousei: Is that not convincing enough for you? Natsume: No, I never said that... *pant* *pant*... *pant*... Urk... You're just staring so hard... Kousei: ...... Natsume: And now you go all quiet on me again. Kousei: Ah, err, sorry. I'm not doing it on purpose. I just can't tear my eyes away... Natsume: *pant*... *pant*... *pant*... *pant*... Kousei: Your vagina's so amazing. Natsume: Huh? What do you mean? Does it look weird? Kousei: No, of course not. Kousei: It's just, this is my first time doing any of this... All I can say is, it's amazing. Natsume: R-Really? Umm, how else would you describe it? Kousei: Let's see... Natsume: Delicious? What are you... N-No, wait. You're... Don't tell me you're... Ahh! Kousei: Nhh... *smooch* Natsume: Ngghhh?! Kousei: Your pussy? Natsume: Ngh! Don't say it outright! Natsume: You didn't hate putting your mouth on my p-pu... did you? You don't have to force yourself. Kousei: I don't hate it one bit. I love every part of you, Natsume. If anything, I want to lick it even more. Kousei: What about you, though? Do you not want me to lick it? Natsume: It's just... embarrassing. That's the worst part... but I don't mind it. Kousei: Alright. In that case... Natsume: Ahh?! Nghh... Mhh... Urk... Ahh! Kousei: *lick* *lick*... *slurp* Natsume: S-Sto... Not there... Ahh! It's too embarrassing... being licked there... Nhh! Natsume: Ah, *pant* *pant*... Do people usually have to go this far? Kousei: *lick... Not that I'd know... but I'm pretty sure this is a normal part of foreplay. Natsume: I'm just a little worried that you're getting most of your information from porn. Kousei: Well, judging from your reactions, it seems like you like this. Natsume: I mean... Kousei: Can I keep kissing you down here? I want to taste you even more, Natsume. Natsume: You promise you'll stop? Kousei: Sure... If I can pump the brakes in time. Kousei: But sorry in advance if I can't stop myself. I'm already on the verge of losing control as is. Kousei: *lick*... *lick* *slurp*... *kiss* *kiss*... *suck*... Natsume: Ahhh... Ahh, ah, ah... ahhh... Eeek?! Natsume: Ahhh?! Ahh... ah, ah, ah, ahhh! Kousei: I just tried focusing my kisses on a specific spot... *kiss* *suck* *kiss* *lick*... Natsume: Ahhh! W-Wait, not there... Noooo! My body's... tingling so much... Ahhh! Kousei: Nhh... Does it hurt? Natsume: It doesn't hurt, but I'm scared of how much my body's tingling. Kousei: Does that mean you want me to stop? Natsume: No, but... *pant* *pant*... A-Are you going to keep kissing me? Kousei: I thought you said you were scared? Natsume: I... I am... but you want to keep going, don't you? Kousei: Of course. But if you don't want me to, I won't; I'll stop here. Kousei: So tell me what you want, Natsume. Natsume: Urk... I-I know you already know what I'm going to say... Natsume: You're teasing me on purpose, aren't you? Kousei: That's not--completely untrue, I guess. Natsume: Nrgh... Kousei: But I don't want to do anything you don't like. That's the truth. Kousei: That's why I want you to say it clearly. Because once we go any further, I get the feeling I won't be able to stop myself. Natsume: Fine... Fine. Keep going. Natsume: I don't hate how much it tingles. It's a little scary, but I want you to keep going. Keep kissing me down there... Kousei: It's your own fault for being so wet down here. *lick* *lick* *kiss*... Natsume: Maybe, but you're definitely making those sounds on purpose... Ahhhh! Ah, ah, ah... ahh! Kousei: Wow... You just keep getting wetter and wetter... *lick* *smack*... Natsume: Ahhhh! I-I can't help it... You're kissing it in such a lewd way... Mhhhh! Kousei: I can be even lewder, you know. Natsume: Ah, ahh! Nooo... That's so dirty--ahh! Ahhh! Kousei: *suck* *slurp*... *lick* *lick*... *kiss*... Kousei: *kiss* *pant*... *pant*... *lick* *lick*... *kiss* *suck* Natsume: It feels, too good... I-I can't... *pant*... Hnghh! Natsume: What? *pant*... *pant*... S-Sorry... But if you keep kissing me like that, I... Hngghhh! Natsume: I can't, I can't, I can't... It feels too good! Ahhh, ahhh, eek! Kousei: Well, as long as I'm making you feel good, I'm happy... *suck* *lick*... Natsume: K-Keep... Keep licking my p-pu... that spot... Kiss it more. Kousei: *kiss*... *slurp* *suck*... Natsume: Ahhhhhh! Ah, ah, ahhh! Yes! That feels amazing... Ahhhhh! Kousei: Your reactions make me really happy, Natsume... *kiss* *lick* *lick*... *suck*... Natsume: Ah, ah! Nooo... No more... Ngh! I can't take this... Ahh! Natsume: S-Something's coming! Please, stop! Any more and I'll... Ah, ah, ahh! Kousei: Nhh... *suck* *slurp* *lick*... Natsume: Ahhh! I can't... I can't, I can't... ahh... I'm really gonna--! Natsume: Ah, ah, ahhhhhhhhhhhn! Kousei: You came, didn't you? Natsume: *pant*... *pant*... This is my first time... but I feel so happy... *pant* *pant* *pant* *pant*... Natsume: Wow... My head's gone all mushy... *pant* *pant*... Kousei: Should we take a little break? Natsume: Ngh... No... If we wait, I'll start getting scared again... Natsume: So let's keep going... Let's... have s-sex. Kousei: I haven't even put it in, though... Kousei: Wait--huh?! Don't tell me I just lost my virginity without even knowing it?! Natsume: Oh, hush, you idiot. That's not the only part of sex that feels good. Natsume: Just feeling each other's warmth like this... feels incredible... Kousei: Y-Yeah. Right, of course! Natsume: You're not listening to a word I'm saying, are you? Kousei: What do you want me to do? I'm just too excited about finally losing my virginity. Natsume: I mean, I get that, but still. Kousei: And I get to do it with the girl I love too. I couldn't be happier. Kousei: It's the only thing on my mind right now. Kousei: But you're sure about this, right? You want to go all the way with me? Natsume: Yeah. I want to go all the way. So hold me. Hold me tighter. Kousei: Sure thing. Natsume: It's a lot b-bigger than I thought... Kousei: I think I'm pretty average-sized, actually. Natsume: What?! R-Really? Kousei: Anyway... are you ready, Natsume? It's getting harder and harder to hold myself back. Natsume: I'm ready, but I want you to k-kiss me first. Kousei: I-In THIS position?! Natsume: No, you idiot. I don't mean down there... I mean a normal kiss. Nhh... Natsume: Ahh! *pant* *pant*... *pant*... M-My belly... feels so hot... Kousei: Ngh... Holy shit... Natsume: *pant* *pant*... I-It doesn't feel weird for you... does it? Kousei: Not at all. It feels amazing. Kousei: Your pussy is so warm, and the way it's sucking on me... it's squeezing me so tight. Kousei: And yet it's pulling me deeper still... I've never felt anything like this before. Seriously, it's amazing... Natsume: Me too... I've never... felt something so hot, so d-deep inside me before... Hngh... Kousei: Does it hurt? Natsume: A little bit, sure, but don't worry about me. And I doubt you're capable of stopping right now, right? Kousei: Yeah. Natsume: So I want you to kiss me instead. Make me forget about the pain. Keep me distracted. Kousei: Nhh... *kiss* Natsume: Urk... Nhh *kiss* *kiss*... *smooch*... *smack* *slurp*... Natsume: *pant* *pant*... *pant*... It doesn't hurt, so much as it feels strange... Natsume: Having this thing moving around inside of me is... *pant* *pant*... kind of amazing. Is it all the way inside? Kousei: Yeah. I think I'm all the way in. Kousei: I'm gonna start moving. Kousei: Nhh... *kiss* *smack*... Natsume: I love you... Ahhh... *kiss* *slurp*... I love you... *smooch* *swirl*... *kiss* *kiss*... Kousei: Am I moving too much for you? Natsume: N-No, I'm fine... *kiss*... Ahh, *pant* *pant*... It does hurt a little bit, but I can take it. Natsume: Ah, ah, ah... It hurts, but keep going... *pant* *pant*... What is this? Kousei: It makes me happy to know I'm making you feel good, Natsume. Natsume: It feels like I'm being split apart... like my insides are tingling... *pant*... It feels like it hurts, but it feels so good... Natsume: I-I'm... I'm not the only one feeling good, am I? Does it feel good for you? Kousei: Do you really need to ask? Your pussy feels incredible. It's making me go crazy. Natsume: Ahh?! Ah, hngh! N-Not so rough! Ah, ah, ah, ahh! Natsume: It's making... such a dirty sound! Nghhhh! Kousei: I think it's really hot, actually... You don't mind if I keep going, do you? *smooch* Natsume: Nghh... Mhh... *kiss* *kiss* *smack*... *lick* *smooch*... *kiss*... Kousei: I can't stop myself anymore, Natsume! Natsume: I can feel you... Mghh! Twitching, inside me... Nh, ngh! Stirring me up... Ah, ah, ah! Kousei: It feels way too good, kissing you up here and down there. Natsume: Ahhhh! Ah, ah, ah! You're kissing me... even deeper than before! Natsume: Hngh, ahhhh! Ahmph, *kiss* *smooch* *smack*... Nhh! Kousei: I love you, Natsume. I love you. Natsume: I love you too! Ah, ah, ahh... I love you, I love you! Natsume: It feels, so good... I want to stay like this forever... *kiss* *kiss*... *smack* *slurp*... Kousei: Natsume... If you keep kissing me like that... *smack* *kiss* *slurp*... Natsume: But it's distracting me from the pain... *kiss* *kiss* *smack*... *lick* *lick*... Kousei: Nhh! *kiss* *smooch*... *smack* Kousei: Does it hurt? Natsume: N-No... Something's... something's c-coming! It's coming... Ngghh! Natsume: It's my first time, but... Ahhhh! But I can't hold it back--ah! Ah, ah, ah, ah! Kousei: It makes me happier than anything to know that you're feeling good. In fact, it's turning me on even more. Natsume: Urk! At this rate, I'm gonna--mngh! *kiss* *smooch* *smooch* *smack*... *kiss* *kiss* Kousei: *kiss* Nh, mhh, nhh... Natsume: Ahh, I can't, I'm gonna... Ah, ah, ah! Hug me more! Tighter! Kousei: Natsume, I'm-- Natsume: Huh? W-Wait, I just... Ah?! Nooo... If you rub me right now, I'm gonna--! Natsume: Ngghhhh! Natsume: *pant* *pant*... I can't, I'm going crazy... *pant* *pant*... Kousei: Natsume... *kiss* Natsume: Mhhh, *smooch* *smack*... It's no use... Even if you kiss me, I... *smooch* *kiss* *kiss* *slurp*... Kousei: Hang in there. I'm about to cum too. Natsume: Ahhh! Ahh! Ahh! I'm gonna cum again! Kousei: Me too. This time, I'm gonna show you how I cum. Natsume: Show me... show me! I want to see you cum! Natsume: *pant* *pant*... Me too... I'm cumming again! Kiss me... kiss me! Kousei: *smooch* *kiss* *kiss* *smack*... *kiss* *smack*... Natsume: Nhhh! Ahh... *pant* *pant*... Ahmph, *kiss* *smooch* *slurp*! Kousei: Nhh, ahh... I'm cumming... Take it all! Natsume: I'll take it, I'll take it... So do it, inside--*kiss* *smack* *smack* *smooch*... Nhh, nghh! Kousei: Kh... ahh! I'm cumming, Natsume! Natsume: *smooch* *smooch* Nh, nhh, nhh, ngghhhh! Natsume: Nggggghhhhhhhhh! Natsume: Nh, nhh! Do it... I'm gonna cum again too! *kiss* *kiss* *smooch* *smooch*... Nhh, mhhhh! Kousei: Natsume! Natsume: *kiss* *kiss* *smack* *slurp* *smooch*... Nhhh, nh, ngghhhh! Natsume: Nggghhhhhhh! Kousei: Ngh, ahh... Natsume: *pant* *pant*... *pant*... I can hardly move... Kousei: Me too. Feels like I ejaculated every last bit of energy I had just now. Kousei: Just goes to show how turned on I was. And how much I love you. Natsume: Hey... I want another kiss... Kousei: Nhh... *kiss* *kiss*... *smooch*... Natsume: Mhh *smack*... Nh, nhhh... *kiss* *smooch*... "

Where'd you meet this boyfriend of yours? Female Student B: What do you like about him anyway? Not that I'm trying to say he's bad--I'm just curious. Natsume: Kousei and I work at the same cafe. As for what I like about him... Natsume: Well, I enjoy being with him. Despite how he looks, he can also be pretty manly. But I guess I'd say the thing I like most about him is-- Student C: Is? Natsume: Honestly, I'm not sure. Natsume: But I love him a lot. All Three: Ahhh! Female Student B: Ohmigosh, you're SOOO adorable! Student C: You're head over heels for him, aren't you? Female Student A: So does that mean you're the one who asked him out? Natsume: Hmm. It's kind of hard to say. Technically, he's the one who confessed to me. Natsume: But I did kiss him before that. Student C: You kissed before you even started dating? Whoa, girl! Natsume: W-Well, you know. We were watching the sunrise on New Year's, and I got swept up in the moment... Female Student B: Oh, wow. So you two really haven't been going out for long. Student C: So did you guys do the deed outside after that kiss? Natsume: N-No, we didn't! Female Student B: Are you stupid? It's way too cold around this time of year to be having sex outdoors. Female Student A: So you're saying it'd be fine if it were summertime?! Student C: Sorry, Shiki-san! Are we making you uncomfortable? Natsume: No, not particularly... Female Student B: Wait. Are you still a virgin, by any chance? Female Student A: Oh my gosh! Have a little more tact, will you? Natsume: It's fine... Um, I'm not a virgin anymore. All Three: Whoa! Female Student A: You gotta tell us! How was it? Natsume: W-Well, it hurt. Student C: Not surprising. Natsume: But it felt good too. Female Student B: Really? Student C: Your boyfriend--um, Takamine-kun, was it? Has he been with a lot of other girls before you? Natsume: I doubt it. He said it was his first time too. Female Student B: Y'know, when I lost my virginity, I bled like hell. Female Student A: So the blood part is true? Student C: Wait, are you... Female Student A: Urk... Y-Yeah, I'm still a virgin! So what?! Female Student B: Hey, I never said there was anything wrong with that! Better to stay a virgin than to get impatient, throw it away, and end up with a crappy experience. Student C: Yep. You want your first time to be something memorable. Don't you agree, Shiki-san? Natsume: Huh? O-Oh, yeah. It definitely hurt, but it was a really wonderful experience. All Three: Whoa... Natsume: I-I mean, yeah, I agree--you shouldn't just throw away your virginity. Female Student A: A-Alright. I guess I'll just wait for the right guy to come along. Female Student A: Still, I'm kinda scared. Out of curiosity, how bad does it hurt? Female Student B: It's kinda hard to put into words, honestly. It was like an \"Eek!\" if that makes sense. Student C: For me, it was more like... \"Hngh!\" Female Student A: Pretty bad, I take it... Female Student A: What about you, Shiki-san? Natsume: For me, I guess it was only about an \"Ouch!\"... Female Student B: Lucky you. Female Student A: Is there some way to make it hurt less? Natsume: I have no idea. I'm not exactly an expert myself. Student C: Foreplay's probably the most important thing, don't you think? Student C: Then again, some guys have dicks so big it doesn't matter how wet you are. Female Student B: Yeah. Ultimately, it's gonna depend on your partner. Some guys are way too horny and wanna put it in without any foreplay, for example. Female Student A: What should I do if that happens? Student C: Hmm. You could make him cum once, and hopefully that calms him down some. Female Student A: Yeah, but how? Student C: With a handjob or a blowjob. Female Student A: A handjob? Natsume: A blowjob... Student C: You could also go for a thighjob, or an armpitjob--or get creative and go for a hairjob, a footjob, or even a shoulder-blade-job. Female Student B: Sheesh. You've done it all, haven't you? Wait--shoulder blades?! How does that even work?! Student C: What do you mean? You just--wait a minute. Student C: Are you interested in trying out some of this stuff too, Shiki-san? Natsume: Yesn't. Female Student A: What? Was that a yes or a no? Female Student B: Correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like a yes to me! Natsume: Have a good day. Kanna: Good job today, guys. Natsume: Yeah. You too. Suzune: It's been a while now since New Year's, but how are the numbers looking? Kanna: Thankfully, the number of customers hasn't declined in the slightest. Natsume: In fact, we might be getting even more than before, thanks to your Mont Blanc. Suzune: Wow, really? I'm glad all that effort paid off then. Kousei: Must've been a lot of work. Suzune: Well, y'know. It's not easy steaming chestnuts, hollowing them out, then straining them. And you gotta do everything by hand, otherwise the aroma and the texture just won't be the same. Kousei: Should I start coming to work a bit earlier to help out? Suzune: Wow. I thought you hated waking up early. Kousei: I do, but I can deal with it if you need the help. Suzune: Well, I kinda hate to ask you to... Kousei: Why's that? Suzune: You've seem kind of worn out these past few days, if you know what I mean. Kousei: ...... Kousei: I've, uh... been doing a lot of studying. My finals are coming up. Suzune: Well, as someone who lives in the same apartment building, let me give you a bit of advice. You might want to try keeping your voice down while you're \"studying.\" Kousei: ...... Natsume: Don't look at me, idiot. Her room is way too far away from yours; there's no way she'd be able to hear us. Kousei: Ah... Suzune: Hehehe. Well, all jokes aside. Suzune: I appreciate the offer, but I shouldn't be making other employees do extra work. If there's a problem, it's the system that needs to be improved. Kousei: You say that, but you're the one who always ends up doing the brunt of the work, Suzune-san... Suzune: Well, I guess that's just the price I pay for doing things my way. Either way, I shouldn't be pushing the responsibility onto the part-timers. Suzune: You've got exams coming up, don't you? Are you feeling confident about those? I wouldn't want to be responsible for your graduation being pushed back a year. Kousei: Don't worry. Despite what you may think of me, I do take my classes seriously. Natsume: I'm confident enough that I won't need to do any last-minute cramming either. Suzune: Great. Kanna: Still, let us know if you need time off. We'll do our best to handle things here on our own. Natsume: Thanks. I appreciate it. Kousei: So, where to today? Your place, or mine? Natsume: Hmm. Let's go to your place. I want to warm up under your kotatsu. Kousei: Alright. Kousei: I still have some hotpot ingredients leftover from last time too. Natsume: Sounds good. Let's have that. Kousei: Man, they were delicious. Natsume: If I make them, I'll probably end up making a lot, so let's save it for next time, and invite the others over. Kousei: Alright. Kousei: But speaking of which--what ever happened to that qipao you wore during New Year's? Natsume: What is it with you and your cosplay fetish? Kousei: I'm sorry, but you just looked way too cute in it. Kousei: Not to say that you don't normally look cute, because you do. Every day. Natsume: Alright, fine. I'll wear it for you next time, if I'm in the mood. Natsume: Phew. That was good. Kousei: Yep. Natsume: Here, let me clean up. Kousei: Nah, I'll do it today. Natsume: You sure? Well, how about I make us a cup of coffee or tea then? Kousei: Hmm. I could definitely go for a cup of coffee. Kousei: But all I have is the instant stuff. Natsume: Where is it? Kousei: Oh, it's on that shelf up there. The tea's up there too. Only tea bags, though. Natsume: Nope. I'm just waiting for the tea to steep. Kousei: You have to steep tea bags too? Natsume: You don't have to, but the tea's a lot more fragrant this way. Kousei: Huh. Well, I'll be waiting over here. Natsume: Okay. Kousei: Phew. Sure is cold tonight. Kousei: Rokurou-san did seem pretty happy with how things turned out. Natsume: What's that? Kousei: Nothing. Just talking to myself. Natsume: Oh. Well, here's your coffee. Kousei: Sorry I only have tea bags for you. Natsume: I don't really mind. Anyway, scooch over. I need to warm myself up too. Kousei: O-Oh, uh, okay... Kousei: Not much space, though. Natsume: What, do you want me to move? Kousei: I never said that. Kousei: You just don't, err, initiate this sort of... physical intimacy very often. Kousei: It's usually me who does it. Natsume: The only thing you initiate is se... sex, Kousei. Kousei: I won't deny that. But I do like cuddling like this too. Kousei: Especially when you're the one seeking it, Natsume. Natsume: Only because I love you. Natsume: There's nothing I enjoy more than being with my boyfriend. Being able to feel you right next to me is the most blissful thing ever. Kousei: Same for me. Natsume: I can tell. You've had that goofy grin on your face for a while now. , Mei: Good morning! Natsume: Good morning. Kanna: Good morning. How was yesterday? Mei: I'm sorry? Natsume: She's talking about your date with Takamine-kun. Mei: My... WHAT? Kanna: You went somewhere together, didn't you? Mei: W-Well, yeah... Natsume: He didn't do anything stupid, did he? Kanna: We were worried that he'd get too carried away and blow his chance. Natsume: Yeah. He seems like the kind of guy to get way too worked up over a date. Mei: Wait, what? What? Suzune: Whoa there. Don't go having this conversation without me! Mei: Ah... Suzune-san. Good morning. Suzune: Good morning. So? You guys were talking about yesterday? Natsume: Yes. Suzune: How was it? How far did you two go? Mei: H-How far? Kanna: Jumping straight into it, are we? Suzune: I know you're just as curious as I am. I mean, they've basically seen each other naked now, no? Mei: WHAT?! Natsume: Wait, really? You've already done THAT? Mei: Oh, no! No, no, no! I mean--WHAT?! Suzune: Okay, maybe that was a bit misleading. I just meant they've seen each other in swimsuits. Mei: A bit?! That was EXTREMELY misleading! Kanna: Oh... so you went swimming? At a hot spring? Mei: We went swimming, yes, but at a pool... Natsume: Really? I didn't know they were already open at this time of year. Suzune: I think she means the big one nearby. It's a heated indoor swimming pool. Natsume: Oh, that sounds like a nice place to go to on a date. Mei: Actually, we went to the one by the station... Suzune: Wait, there's a pool by the station? When did they build that? Natsume: It must have a hot spring built in too. If it's by the station, I should go check it out myself sometime. Mei: Umm... No, it's not that sort of pool. It's a gym... Natsume: What? A gym? Mei: Yes. Like, a fitness center... Kanna: You went to a fitness center together? Mei: Yes... That is indeed where we went. Suzune: Oh. I thought for sure you went to a recreational pool to mess around and have fun. Mei: We just went to do some exercise. Separately... Kanna: Separately? Natsume: That... doesn't sound like much of a date. Suzune: More like a workout, than anything. Kanna: That's rather disappointing... Mei: Wh-What do you mean? It wasn't supposed to be a date! Suzune: Oh, come on. Don't be shy. Mei: I'm telling you, it wasn't a date! Suzune: Psh. That's lame. Mei: H-How? Natsume: A gym, huh? Well, I can certainly see that, coming from you. Mei: ...... Kanna: What's the matter? Mei: No, it's just... I feel a little dumb about the whole thing... Natsume: What for? Mei: The truth is, Senpai thought we were going to a recreational pool as well, but the idea hadn't crossed my mind at all... Suzune: Ahh. So Kousei was the only one who thought it was a date. Mei: N-No, I don't think that's the case... Mei: But still, he was absolutely right. We shouldn't have gone to a fitness center pool... Natsume: Oh, okay. So you wish you'd picked a better place for a date as well. Mei: F-For the last time, it wasn't a date! Kanna: Then allow me to be frank. How do you feel about him? Mei: Who? Kanna: Takamine-san, of course. Mei: Huh? Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What do you mean by that? Natsume: That reaction already says it all. Mei: N-No, I just, um... I have a lot of respect for him. Natsume: Respect? Mei: Y-Yes. Natsume: You... respect him? Kanna: Please don't look so bewildered. I feel bad for him now. Natsume: Sorry. Suzune: You respect him, nothing more? Mei: Huh? Well, um... I guess it's not only that... Mei: But... it's mostly respect... I think... Suzune: Hmm. Suzune: ...... Suzune: Nozomi-san's coming in today, isn't she? Kanna: Yes. Her shift starts at lunch. Suzune: Good. Are you all busy tonight? Natsume: Not particularly. Kanna: I don't have any plans either. Suzune: Well, if Nozomi-san's free as well, let's have a girls' night out! Suzune: Against the four of us, Mei-san doesn't stand a chance. Mei: Wait! What are you going to do to me?! Kanna: That's a great idea. Natsume: Sounds like fun. Mei: What? Huh? Why? Suzune: ...... Mei: Wh-What? Why are you grinning at me like that? Seriously, what? Suzune: Alright! Time to get to work, everybody! Kanna: Let's get down to it! Natsume: I'm looking forward to tonight. Mei: Wait, what? Hold up. Mei: Seriously? Kousei: See you guys later. Natsume: See you. Suzune: Where do you girls want to go? Should we find a restaurant somewhere? Kousei: Oh, are you all going out to eat? Kanna: We're having a girls' night out tonight. Nozomi: I can't wait. *giggle* Mei: ...... Kousei: Is it just me, or is Hiuchidani-san the only one not very excited about it? Natsume: Don't be silly. She's totally excited. Right? Mei: Yes. I am very excited. Kousei: Huh. Could've fooled me. Suzune: Actually, why don't we just go to my place? We'll have a hard time finding any places open this late. Natsume: True. We can just stop by a convenience store on the way and buy something there. Suzune: Alright. Let's get going. Suzune: Oh, and no boys allowed, so go kill some time before you follow us home, Kousei. Kousei: Huh? But if we're all going to the same apartment complex, why can't I just-- Suzune: No can do. Our girls' night out is already underway. Kousei: Fine. Suzune: Come on, girls. Let's go. Nozomi: Okaay. Mei: ...... Kousei: You alright, Hiuchidani-san? Mei: ...... Kousei: I'm gonna take that as a \"no.\" Suzune: Come on, Mei-san. Mei: Okay... Kousei: ...... Kousei: Weird. Suzune: Anyone want a beer? Natsume: I'm fine. Kanna: No, thank you. Suzune: Oh, well. More for me. Nozomi: Uh, so I forgot to ask, but why exactly are we having a girls' night out anyway? Suzune: So we can interrogate Mei-san about her relationship with Kousei. Nozomi: Her relationship with Kousei-kun? Mei: I wanna go home. Suzune: Aww, c'mon. We won't ask you anything too invasive. Just play along with us for tonight. Mei: *sigh*... What do you want to know? Kanna: In all honesty, how do you feel about Takamine-san? Mei: Cutting right to the chase, huh. I already answered that this morning, didn't I? Kanna: You said you respected him, but is that really all there is to it? Mei: I mean... Nozomi: Did something happen between them? Natsume: They went out somewhere together yesterday. Nozomi: Oh, phew. That's not bad... Suzune: What do you mean? Nozomi: I was afraid they'd gotten into a fight or something. Suzune: Oh, no. Just the opposite. They've actually been getting quite chummy lately. Nozomi: Oh, really? Natsume: How do you feel about all this, Sumizome-san? You're his childhood friend. Nozomi: He's never really been popular with girls, so honestly... I think it's great! It feels like my little Kousei-kun is finally growing up! Kanna: It almost sounds like you're talking about him as a brother. Nozomi: Well, we have known each other for a long time. That's just what happens. Kanna: There's your answer. Mei: What? Seriously, what? How do you want me to respond to that? Suzune: Let me be serious with you for a moment. Mei: Um, okay. Suzune: Whenever you have men and women working in the same place, it often presents a unique problem. Mei: Okay? Suzune: See, it's fine if they get along well, but if things turn sour, that can affect the atmosphere of the entire workplace, reducing productivity. Suzune: In order to avoid such things, it's therefore important for me to have a clear understanding of my coworkers' interpersonal relationships. Mei: Oh. I think I get that... Mei: ...... Mei: Did you really need to invite everyone else here for that, though? Suzune: Nope. Mei: What? Suzune: I just thought it'd be funner with more people. Mei: Seriously? Suzune: I won't deny that I'm doing this for amusement, but I also want to support you. Suzune: All you guys feel that way too, right? Natsume: Well, half that, and half out of curiosity. Kanna: I came 100\\% out of curiosity. Nozomi: In that case, I came 100\\% to support you! Suzune: See? Mei: Oh, uh... Thanks? Natsume: To be honest, like Suzune-san said, I want to know how things are going between you two as well--even though it's not really any of my business. Natsume: The cafe is just a really important place to me, so I'd hate for there to be any problems caused by interpersonal relationships. Natsume: Maybe I'm just a cynic, but I feel like it's all too easy for office romances to lead to those sorts of conflicts. Mei: Romance? Umm... I had a feeling that's where this was going, but, like... Natsume: Am I wrong? Mei: I don't think things between me and him are... like that. Kanna: You don't sound very confident. Mei: I mean, I don't have any experience with relationships, so I don't really know... Suzune: It definitely seems like you've got chemistry, though. From what I've seen, at least. Mei: Chemistry? Kanna: I agree. You become much more animated when you're talking with Takamine-san compared to when you talk with us. Mei: I-Is that true? I've never realized that myself... Natsume: I'd go so far as to say your eyes start to sparkle... maybe? Well, you get the idea. Suzune: You always go \"Senpai, Senpai!\" in such a cheerful voice. Whenever you're with Kousei, you seem even more upbeat than usual. Mei: What? Seriously? Natsume: What do you think, Sumizome-san? Have you noticed any recent changes in Takamine-kun's behavior? Nozomi: Hmm... I don't know. They definitely get along well, that's for sure. Nozomi: Ah--but I guess he seems a lot more... relaxed whenever he's around Mei-chan. Compared to Natsume-san and Kanna-san, for example. Natsume: True. He won't even sit beside me in class. Nozomi: Not a surprise. He's not really used to dealing with girls. Nozomi: But when he's with Mei-chan, I feel like he's more comfortable acting natural. Natsume: Hmm. I guess part of it might have to do with her being younger. Suzune: Not all the time, though. Yesterday he was all restless and fidgety. Mei: What? He was? Suzune: Yep. He was having a bit of trouble concentrating on work. Suzune: It made me smile, but he also kind of needed to get his act together. Suzune: So in all seriousness, the sooner you two sort out your feelings, the happier I'll be. Mei: Urk... Easier said than done... Kanna: It's almost Valentine's Day too. The timing couldn't be better. Nozomi: Oh, Valentine's Day! Are we doing anything special at the cafe? Natsume: Hopefully. Suzune-san and I are still figuring out what, though. Suzune: We'll probably do another limited-time special like we did on Christmas. I doubt it'll be as hectic this time around, though. Nozomi: True. People don't usually buy their Valentine's chocolates from cake shops. Suzune: If only chocolate had a longer shelf life. But yeah, that's why it's just going to be a limited-time thing, for girls to buy for their acquaintances and such. Suzune: You know, friend-chocolate. Kanna: Oh, that's right! I nearly forgot to ask. What should we do about OUR chocolates? Natsume: You mean for Takamine-kun? Kanna: Yes. And Mikado-san too. I wasn't sure if we should give our male coworkers chocolates. Nozomi: Why don't we give them one big gift, from all of us? That way it'll be easier for them to prepare a return gift too, as opposed to having to buy a gift for each of us individually. Natsume: Good idea. He'd probably be disappointed if we didn't get him anything. Suzune: In that case, Mei-san can get him something a little more personal. Mei: Gosh, why do we keep going here? Suzune: Well, it's either that or you pitch in with the rest of us. Which do you want? Mei: Well... I mean... Urk... Suzune: See? You don't want to, do you? Mei: Well, I mean... he does a lot for me, so, like... Mei: If I'm going to give him something... I want it to be from ME. Natsume: That's the only reason? Mei: Urk... Kanna: Oh? You're not denying it. Mei: I don't know what you want me to say... Mei: Ngh! Mei: I really don't know. I mean, I do l-like him, of course... Mei: But I just like him as a person... I don't know if that means I l-love him or not. Suzune: Ahhh! So adorbs! My heart can't take it! Natsume: God, what's gotten into you? Are you drunk? Suzune: A little. Kanna: Let me ask you this then. If Takamine-san started getting chummy with another girl, how would that make you feel? Mei: Hmm... Natsume: Out of all of us, I'd say he's closest to Sumizome-san, right? Nozomi: I guess, considering how long we've known each other. Suzune: Do you ever feel like there's a side of him only you know about? Nozomi: Something only I know? Let me think... Nozomi: His face when he wakes up, I guess? Kanna: You're not talking about what I think you are, are you? Nozomi: No, not like that. He gets up early by himself now, but I used to have to come over every morning to wake him up. Suzune: Ahh. I have a younger brother too, so I know what that's like. He'd always whine and yell when I yanked off his covers. Nozomi: Yeah... I once made the mistake of doing that too... Natsume: Why was it a mistake? Nozomi: You know how in the morning, guys get... um, you know... Suzune: Morning wood? Nozomi: Oh my god! You just outright said it! Mei: Morning what? Suzune: It's when guys get an uncontrollable erection in the morning. Mei: ...... Mei: Ahh! Suzune: Gee, what an adorable reaction. Nozomi-san, on the other hand, seems like she's pretty used to it. Nozomi: I wouldn't really say that. I've just happened to see it a few times, is all... Suzune: Oh-ho. So you've seen his erect ding-a-ling \"a few times,\" have you now? Natsume: His what? Kanna: She's definitely drunk, alright. Nozomi: I-It wasn't on purpose or anything, okay? It just happened on rare occasions when I came to wake him up... Suzune: Well, how does it feel knowing another woman's seen his, um... his wing-dang-doodle, Mei-san? Natsume: Excuse me? Kanna: You're a terrible drunk, Suzune-san. Suzune: Go ahead and tell us. Another woman's seen his private parts. How does that make you feel? Mei: Urk... Mei: Ngh... Mei: Nghhh! Mei: ...... Mei: It makes me feel... a little put out... I guess. Suzune: So you do have some feelings for him, deep down. Mei: Urk... I don't know... Suzune: Well, if you're planning to make him some homemade chocolate, let me know. I'll teach you everything you need to know. Mei: Homemade? But that'd totally make it seem like I... you know. Natsume: Like you're confessing to him, right. Mei: He might think I'm being too clingy, though... Nozomi: I don't know about that. I think he'd be thrilled. Suzune: So what do you say? Wanna make some homemade chocolate? Mei: Homemade chocolate... to confess my feelings... Homemade chocolate... Mei: Urk... Nghhhh! Mei: Ngh. Nozomi: M-Mei-chan? Natsume: She collapsed. Kanna: Her face is red as a beet too. Mei: I can't think straight anymore... My head's about to explode... Suzune: Aww, look at her. Acting all flustered like a young girl in love. Natsume: I feel like it's mostly your fault she's like this. Suzune: Sorry, she's just too cute. I can't help but tease her. Mei: Please, just let me go home already... I'm really not good with these sorts of conversations... Kanna: I know I said I only came because I was curious, but if you really are planning to confess to Takamine-san, I'll be glad to assist in any way I can. Kanna: I'd love for you two to be happily together. Nozomi: Me too! Let me know if there's anything I can do. Natsume: Alright. I think it's time we put this conversation to rest. It doesn't look like Hiuchidani-san can take much more. Mei: I can't... I'm about to die from embarrassment... Suzune: Man, what I wouldn't give to be young again... Kanna: What are you talking about? You're still plenty young. Suzune: There's a world of difference between being a student and being a working adult. Suzune: Time'll pass by before you know it, Mei-san. Make sure you don't leave any regrets behind. Mei: Urk... Alright. I'll try to think about how I really feel... Suzune: Honestly, though, it's already pretty clear to the rest of us. Kanna: That's just how love works. The person themselves can oftentimes be oblivious to the fact. Natsume: Very true. Nozomi: You three talk like you know a lot. You must have a ton of dating experience, huh? All Three: ...... Nozomi: Why did you all look away? Do you... not? Natsume: Anyway, why don't we start discussing our Valentine's Day menu? Suzune: Sounds like a great idea! Kanna: Indeed! Nozomi: Oops... I guess I shouldn't have asked. Mei: Urk... Mei: Do I really like him... that way? Mei: ...... Mei: Urk... I don't know! Ngh! Mei: G-Good morning! Kousei: What did you do to her yesterday? Suzune: Nothing. We just had a little chat. Kousei: ...... Suzune: Why are you giving me that look? Kousei: Because she's clearly acting weird. Suzune: Well, it's obvious why... Suzune: ...... Kousei: What do you mean? Suzune: Well, maybe I do owe her an apology. Kousei: What? Suzune: I might've teased her a little too much. Kousei: Huh? Suzune: Well, thankfully, we might see some progress now. Kousei: What progress? Suzune: You'll see soon enough. And you'd better thank me when it happens. Kousei: When what happens? Suzune: Uh-oh. Our orders are starting to pile up. Better get back to work. Kanna: Actually, Takamine-san, could I ask you and Mei-san to stay behind for a little while? Mei: Huh? Suzune: Hold on. What are you doing? Kanna: This doesn't have anything to do with what we discussed yesterday. I just need to talk to them about their shifts. Suzune: Oh, okay. Suzune: Well, see you all tomorrow! Natsume: Bye, everyone. Kanna: No, of course not. Kousei: I thought so. This is about Hiuchidani-san's eye, isn't it? Mikado: Yes, indeed. Mei: I forgot to ask before, but does anyone at the cafe else know about my eye? Mikado: Natsume knows. Suzune and Nozomi do not, however. Mei: Natsume-san san knows too? That's a relief. Kanna: Still, I must advise you not to speak with her about it too carelessly. We wouldn't want anyone overhearing you by accident. Mei: Alright. Mikado: How are things going with your eye? Mei: Nothing much has changed. Mikado: Which means you haven't found a way to release your butterflies yet? Mei: Err... No, not yet. Kanna: We haven't had many opportunities to practice, after all. Would you like to do some now? Mei: Sure. Mei: But that being said... Mikado: You said you are able to capture butterflies simply by staring at them, correct? Mei: Yeah. After I stare at them for a while, they just disappear. Kanna: In that case, perhaps you could do the opposite, and try staring at an empty space while imagining them appearing. Mei: Imagine them appearing? Mei: Nghhh... Mei: ...... Mei: It's not working. Kousei: What about other people who had the eye? How did they release their butterflies? Mikado: Well, if we knew that, we would not be having this problem. Kousei: Good point. But haven't any other Grim Reapers documented it? Kanna: We've tried searching for more information, but no such luck. Kanna: And to the best of my knowledge, Mei-san is the only person who possesses the eye yet can't see the butterflies. Kousei: So she's an anomaly? Mikado: We don't know that either. People who possess the eye are rare enough in and of themselves. There is simply not enough information. Mikado: That is precisely what makes her such an interesting case study. Kousei: You make her sound like some kind of guinea pig... Mei: That's okay. I want to find out everything I can about my eye as well. Mei: If anything, I should be the one apologizing for being so unhelpful... Kanna: If only I could use my scythe to retrieve the butterflies from your eye... Kousei: You can't? Kanna: I don't dare try. It could end up causing unforeseen damage to Mei-san's soul. Kanna: Perhaps if I knew exactly where the butterflies were located, I might be able to do something about it, but I don't. Mikado: We are no longer able to sense butterflies that have been captured by the eye. Mikado: That is why we did not realize that Mei possessed the eye in the first place. Kousei: Interesting. Kanna: I just had an idea, Mei-san. Mei: Yes? Kanna: Whenever you capture butterflies, is there anything in particular that you think of? Mei: Something I think of? Hmm... I'm not really sure... Kanna: So you do it without thinking? Mei: Well... I guess I think to myself, \"Go away!\" or something like that. Mei: But the very first time I ever noticed a wisp... Mei: ...... Mei: I was mostly just curious. \"What is that?\" I thought, and so I kept staring at it until it disappeared. Mei: That's what crossed my mind the first time it happened, at least. Kanna: Just curiosity... Kousei: So then if she does the opposite, and tries NOT to think about the butterflies, she'll be able to release them? Mikado: You realize that, until just recently, she had no idea that there were even butterflies inside her? Kousei: Oh, right. I guess she hasn't been thinking about them this whole time. I wonder what it is she needs then? Kanna: Maybe what she needs is... something more concrete. Mei: What do you mean? Kanna: If, by thinking about \"butterflies\", you are able to capture them... Kanna: Then perhaps by focusing your thoughts on a specific \"place\", you'll be able to release them. Mei: Oh. So instead of just vaguely trying to release them anywhere, I should try to think about releasing them towards someplace specific? Kanna: Why don't you give it a shot? Mei: Alrighty! Mei: Ngh... Mei: Nghh! Mei: C'mon, the chair... The chair! Mei: Nggghhhhh! Mikado: It doesn't seem to be working. Mei: I'm sorry... Kanna: Maybe you aren't focusing hard enough... or maybe I'm just completely wrong. Kanna: Hmm... Kanna: Your Excellency. Mikado: Yes? Kanna: Please turn into your cat form. Mikado: I beg your pardon? Kanna: Please turn into your cat form. Mikado: I refuse. Kanna: Please turn into your cat form. Mikado: You can repeat yourself however many times you wish, but no means no! Kanna: Please! I'm sure this will work! Remember that Mei-san has an abnormal fixation with cats. Mikado: I will not! Mei: A-Abnormal fixation? That's mean... Kousei: Well... she's not wrong. Mei: You too, Senpai?! Kousei: I mean... you turn pretty crazy whenever you see a cat. Kanna: To put it bluntly, you turn into a complete maniac. Mei: W-Wow! You're so mean! Kanna: We've got nothing to lose by trying. Please, Your Excellency! This is for Mei-san's sake! Mikado: Kgh... Very well. But you had best keep yourself under control this time, Mei. Mei: Don't worry! I will, I promise! Mikado: I do not believe you! Kanna: Please, Your Excellency. Hurry it up! Mikado: Fine... Have your wish! Mei: Ahhhhhhh! Mikado: Mei! Have you already forgotten your promise?! Mei: R-R-Relax! I-I'm fine! I-I'm completely calm! Kousei: That look in your eyes begs to differ... Kanna: This is just a guess... but Mei-san seems like the kind of person stray cats run from. Mei: How did you know? It's true; even cats that are used to people always run away from me! I wonder why? Mikado: Is it not painfully obvious? Kanna: Now then, Mei-san. Please try imagining your butterflies being released around His Excellency. Mei: R-Right! A-Around His Excellency! Y-Yes! O-Of course! Mikado: I do not wish to be rude, Mei, but I find your behavior most repulsive right now. Kousei: That's about as rude as it gets, though. Mei: I don't mind! He can call me repulsive as much as he wants! Kousei: You've got problems, Hiuchidani-san. Seriously. Mei: A-Anyway, here I go! Mikado: Very well. But you can do it standing from there. Do not come any closer, you hear? Mei: A-Alright! *pant*... *pant*... Mikado: ...... Mei: *pant*... *pant*! Mikado: Why are you breathing so heavily? Mei: *PANT*... *PANT*! Mikado: Enough! If this goes on any further, I will not be safe! Mei: *PAAAANT*! Kanna: Alright, Mei-san. Settle down, settle down. Mei: Huh? It's over? My time's up already? Wait! How much do I have to pay for an extension?! Mikado: What on earth is this child talking about? Kousei: Well, I guess that didn't work either. Kanna: My idea must've been wrong. I suppose we'll have to think this over some more. Mei: Five thousand yen! I'll pay five thousand yen! Mikado: That is quite enough. Playtime is over. Mei: Ahh... He's gone... Mikado: Good grief. I am beginning to suspect that this derangement of yours is a side effect of using your eye... Mei: What do you mean? I was totally calm and collected. Kousei: ...... Kanna: ...... Mikado: I believe you have something to say to me, Mei. Mei: Okay, fine! I'm sorry! Kanna: Anyway, why don't we stop here for today? Mikado: Before we do, though, I must ask. Have you captured any other butterflies lately besides the ones in the cafe? Mei: No. I haven't used my powers at all outside of the cafe. Mikado: Alright. Very well. Kanna: If that's all, then we'll see you-- Mei: Actually, can I ask one more thing? Mikado: Yes? Mei: Is it possible that using my eye... could have a negative effect on the person? Kanna: You mean when you use it to capture butterflies? Mei: Yeah. You said that it had the power to heal people's souls, but, um... how do I put this... Kousei: For example, if a person's soul was weakened because of a physical problem, healing their soul wouldn't resolve the underlying issue. Kousei: On the contrary, healing only their soul might have a negative effect on their body. Kousei: I think that's what Hiuchidani-san means to say. Mei: R-Right. That's it. Thank you. Mikado: Hmm... It is difficult to say for certain. Mei: In that case, isn't it kind of risky for me to be using my eye on our customers? Mikado: Perhaps. But it is also better than doing nothing. Mikado: There have been no instances of any customers returning to the cafe with new butterflies after you captured their old ones. Mikado: As of this moment, we have no reason to believe that the power of your eye has any negative effect on others. Mei: Oh... Kanna: Did something happen that caused you to think that it might? Mei: N-No, not exactly... Mei: ...... Mei: It's just... I feel like I've been getting a little carried away ever since I learned the truth about my eye, and learned that there were other people that understood me. Mei: If it turns out that my eye is causing others harm, though... I'd rather just stop using it altogether. Mikado: It is I who tasked you with capturing other people's butterflies. If there truly are any negative consequences of doing so, it would be my responsibility to bear. Mikado: So do not worry. Thanks to you, our job of collecting butterflies has been going remarkably smoothly. That is a fact. Mei: Okay. Thank you for saying that. Kanna: Are there any other questions you'd like to ask? Mei: No, that's all. Kanna: In that case, I'll see you both tomorrow. Good night. Mikado: Good night. Make sure you get plenty of rest. Mei: We will. Good night! Kousei: Good night. Kanna: ...... Mikado: Are you still worried? Kanna: I'm a little relieved, actually, knowing that Mei-san has her own reservations about using her eye. Mikado: I've never been worried about that myself. Despite appearances, she is a very rational-- Mikado: ...... Kanna: Struggling to finish that sentence, aren't you? Mikado: Allow me to rephrase. Although she tends to lose her head under certain circumstances, she is generally a very compassionate person. Mikado: She is the sort of person who would never even think about abusing the power of her eye. Kanna: I'm not worried about that either. I trust Mei-san completely. Kanna: What worries me is... something else. Mikado: We've already warned her many times not to let anyone realize the truth about her eye. Kanna: I know. Of course, times have changed now, but still... Mikado: People's hearts remain largely the same. Kanna: That's why I was against using her eye in the first place. Kanna: There may not be any problems right now, but if things start to fall apart, Mei-san will be the one to suffer. Kanna: And all the positive influence she's been having on Takamine-san's soul will be for naught. Kanna: If anything were to happen to Mei-san, Takamine-san would undoubtedly be greatly affected as well. Mikado: Hmm. So it is not Mei, but Takamine Kousei you are worried about? Kanna: I'm worried about them both. But... I realize I may just be feeling overprotective. Kanna: If you wish for her to have full control over the power of her eye, I won't object. Rest assured. Mikado: I understand that you are concerned, but we cannot allow these butterflies to simply remain inside of Mei either. Kanna: I know. Mikado: Incidentally, Kanna. Kanna: Yes? Mikado: What exactly was it that you and Mei spoke about yesterday? I understand you and the others had a \"girls' night out.\" Kanna: Tsk, tsk. How rude, Your Excellency. You mustn't ask a young lady to divulge her secrets. Mikado: Ah. So it was nothing of importance then. Kanna: Nihihi. Nope. Just a little gossip between girls, is all. Kanna: I do hope everything works out between those two, though... Mei: Oh... yeah. It's been weighing on my mind for a while now. Mei: The truth is, I've been getting a little carried away ever since His Excellency gave me this task. Mei: I'm worried that I've only been adding to people's troubles, like I did to her. Mei: I was starting to question whether capturing our customer's wisps was the right thing to do. Kousei: Hmm... It's hard to say. Mei: Yeah. It is. Kousei: But you know, I've been thinking as well. Kousei: I suggested that maybe this friend of yours had a physical problem, and that's why she still hasn't gotten better. Kousei: But after you'd cast your \"magic spell\" on her, you saw a significant improvement in her mood, didn't you? Mei: Yeah. While I wouldn't say she recovered completely, there was definitely a big improvement. Kousei: If that's true, then it must be some sort of emotional problem. That's why the power of your eye was able to cheer her up temporarily. Kousei: And in that case, there's no doubt in my mind that your \"magic spell\" provided her with some much-needed relief. Kousei: While it's unfortunate that she ended up becoming overly dependent on it, it's clear that the weight in your friend's heart was lightened because of you. Kousei: If I had to say whether it was the right or wrong decision, I'd have to say it was right. Kousei: So I don't think there's anything you should feel guilty or anxious about. Kousei: The power in your left eye is unmistakably a power that helps others. And I'm certain it'll help a lot more people from now on. Mei: ...... Kousei: Uh... sorry. Maybe it's not my place to say anything. Mei: N-No, don't apologize... Mei: ...... Mei: C-Can you read my mind, Senpai? Kousei: Huh? Mei: It makes me really happy... You always seem to know exactly what I want to hear. Mei: It almost feels like you know exactly what I'm thinking all the time. Kousei: Nah... I'm not that sensitive, to be honest. In fact, I can be downright insensitive sometimes. Kousei: But one thing I will say is that I'm not saying these things just to cheer you up. Kousei: I mean it. All of it. Kousei: The stuff about me being grateful to you, and the stuff about your eye--you, helping other people. Kousei: I mean all of it, from the bottom of my heart. Kousei: And if I managed to get that message across to you, well... then that'd make me happy too. Mei: ...... Kousei: Sorry if I seem like I'm trying too hard to be cool or something. I'm lame, I know. Mei: N-No! You're really not... Mei: ...... Mei: U-Umm! Kousei: Hm? Mei: Do you like sweets, Senpai? Kousei: Huh? What's this about? Mei: Do you? Kousei: Well, sure, I guess. Mei: Okay, great! Good night! Kousei: Huh? O-Oh. Yeah, g'night. Mei: Thanks for walking me home! See you tomorrow! Kousei: R-Right. See you tomorrow... Mei: ...... Mei: Hi, Suzune-san? It's me, Mei. I'm sorry for the random call... Mei: Um, I was wondering something... Mei: ...... Mei: C-Could you teach me how to make my own chocolate? , Somei: I'll try to be more positive. I feel like people tend to worry too much about contacting old friends, only to find out it's no big deal once they actually do it. Kousei: True. Somei: Don't you have to get back to work, though? Kousei: Oh, crap! I forgot! Somei: Speaking of the cafe, I wouldn't say no to a slice of cake next time you visit! Kousei: Well, I guess. But I thought you were about to be discharged soon? Somei: Yeah, I am. Kousei: In that case, you might as well come by the cafe yourself. Somei: Ahh, sure. I'll think about it. Kousei: By the way, do you think I could get your phone number? Somei: Oh-ho! And you said you're not a cheater. She's not gonna be happy to hear this! Kousei: Please don't joke about that. She can be seriously scary when she gets mad. Somei: Why do you want my number then? Oh, are you gonna introduce me to one of your guy friends? Kousei: Hmm. Well, if you're serious, I guess I could introduce you to one of my college buddies. Somei: Wait. Seriously? Kousei: Sure, it's not that big of a deal. Kousei: I won't ask you to do anything for me in return... but maybe you'd be willing to give me some advice? Natsume: How does kissing feel so good? All we're doing is putting our lips together... Natsume: If this is what kissing feels like, then... Female Nurse: Oh? Has your boyfriend already left? Natsume: He came here during his break at work, so he couldn't stay long. Female Nurse: You're a lucky girl. Not many guys would come see their girlfriend every day of the week. Natsume: ...... Female Nurse: Oh, no need to blush. Female Nurse: There's no reason a pretty girl like you shouldn't have a man or two around her arm. You might not think it, but I was quite the playgirl back in my younger days. Natsume: I'm fine with just the one, actually. Female Nurse: Oh, you're more pure-hearted than I expected. Natsume: Anyway, um... there's something I'd like to ask. Female Nurse: What's that? Natsume: If I leave the hospital tomorrow as scheduled, will I be able to go back to my life as usual? Female Nurse: Well, yes. Natsume: So I should be able to take hot baths, and engage in a bit of... ph-physical activity? Female Nurse: That shouldn't be a problem. But it'll also depend on what kind of physical activity you... Female Nurse: Ahh. So THAT'S what you mean. Female Nurse: Most girls your age are interested in those things, all the more so if they have a boyfriend. Heck, back in my younger days, I-- Natsume: Ngh! Female Nurse: Well, maybe another time. But I get it--you can't exactly ask Dr. Miyama a question like that. Alright. I'll try to ask him for you as discreetly as I can. Natsume: I'd, um, appreciate that... Female Nurse: Oh, how I wish I was young like you again. Kousei: ...... Suzune: Try relaxing a bit more, will you? Kousei: Easier said than done. I can't help but worry. Kanna: Did the tests come back okay? Kousei: Yeah, that's what she texted me. Said she was clear to be discharged today. Suzune: Alright. The caprese-style pasta's ready to go out. Kanna: I'll take it. Kanna: Here is your caprese-style pasta. I'll bring you your sachertorte and blend coffee once you've finished. Kanna: Please, enjoy your meal. Mikado: Welcome to Cafe Stella. Hm? Ah, if it isn't Shiki Natsume. Natsume: Hello. Mei: Huh? Oh, it's Natsume-senpai! Welcome back! Nozomi: Welcome back! Natsume: Oh, I didn't know you two were working today. Nozomi: They needed some extra help till you got back. Mei: Plus, we wanted to be here to see you! Boy, I ran here as fast as I could once school let out. Natsume: Ah. Thanks for doing that. Mei: Oh, you don't have to thank us for that! Ahaha. Mei: We've missed you a whole lot this past week. Nozomi: Since they let you out, does that mean you're all good to go now? Natsume: Yeah. I'm fine. Nozomi: Are you sure? You weren't in the hospital for as long as I thought you'd be. Kanna: Health and sickness start with the mind, after all. I'm sure those daily visits from a certain somebody did wonders to speed her recovery. Nozomi & Mei: Ahh. Natsume: You didn't have to say that out loud. Kanna: Welcome back, Natsume-san. Mikado: Welcome back. Natsume: Thanks. I'll be able to get back to work by tomorrow. Mei: What? So soon? You can rest up a little longer, if you need to. Nozomi: Yeah. If you need any help settling back into things, just ask! We're all here for you! Natsume: I will. Thank you, everyone. Kanna: But that's enough about work. You're here as a customer today, aren't you? Mei: Table for one, Miss? Suzune: Ah, look who it is. I had a feeling that's what all the commotion was about. Suzune: Welcome back, Natsume-san. Natsume: Mhm. I'm glad to be back. Kousei: Make it non-alcoholic, please. Bartender: Certainly. Kousei: You okay after all that? I'm surprised you don't have heartburn. Natsume: A small price to pay. Humans can't live without eating good food. Kousei: You seem like you're in a good mood. Natsume: Maybe it's because I just got out of the hospital, but everything tasted so delicious. Kousei: Because... of me? Natsume: Nope. Not quite. Natsume: Not just because of you, but because of everyone. Kousei: You mean everyone at the cafe? Natsume: Yeah. I don't want to sound like I'm still hung up on this, though. Kousei: Don't worry. I'm here to listen. Natsume: See, years ago, whenever I was released from the hospital... people would always stare at me from a distance. Natsume: They didn't exactly treat me like I was helpless, but they always seemed confused, like they didn't know what to say to me. Natsume: And that's why... Bartender: Here you are, ma'am. Kousei: Stop joking about that. Kousei: If it turns out there's actually alcohol in there, I'm going to start worrying about you again. Natsume: Okay, okay. Sorry. I'll stop for today. Kousei: Alright. Let's get you home now. Natsume: ...... Kousei: Natsume? Natsume: Nothing... Kousei: Okay? Kousei: Oh, yeah. Finals are coming up. You feeling confident? You've been pretty busy lately, so you probably haven't had much time to study. Natsume: Well, I'm sure I'll manage. Kousei: Why don't we study together sometime for the class we share? Natsume: Sure. I don't mind. Kousei: ...... Natsume: ...... Kousei: ...... Kousei: What's the matter? Kousei: ...... Kousei: Haha, very funny. I thought I told you to stop joking ar-- Natsume: I'm not joking. And I'm not drunk either. Kousei: ...... Natsume: I want to stay with you... a bit longer... Kousei: Ah, er, sorry. Yeah... Kousei: I just never expected this, so my mind's kinda going haywire right now. So, um... Kousei: Alright. Kousei: I want to be with you too, Natsume. Kousei: *pant*... *pant*... Kousei: ...... Kousei: Nghhh! Kousei: *inhale*... *exhale*... *inhale*... *exhale*... *inhale*... Kousei: %123;*choke*?! Kousei: Er, no. 'Course not. Kousei: *inhale*... *exhale*... Kousei: You look really sexy. Natsume: Ngh... Kousei: Err, sorry. That was supposed to be a compliment. Y-You're not mad, are you? Natsume: No, I'm not. It's just... incredibly embarrassing. Kousei: You really look beautiful, though. Positively stunning. I'm getting turned on just looking at you. Kousei: My bad. Kousei: But, err, instead of that... Kousei: Can I... touch you? Natsume: Are you really going to ask me that now? Take a hint. Kousei: Yeah. Sorry. Natsume: It's my first time, so we need to do a bit more foreplay first. You know, kissing, stuff like that... Kousei: R-Right. Sorry. Kissing... Nhh... Natsume: I wasn't saying for you to kiss me down THERE! Kousei: Huh? Natsume: Why are you surprised?! Is this really news to you?! There's an order to this stuff! Kousei: O-Oh. Sorry. You're right. First things first. Kousei: Please tell me your name and age. Natsume: What am I, interviewing for the casting couch? Natsume: Oh, for crying out loud. You totally ruined the mood now. Natsume: I hope you know how humiliating this is for me. Kousei: I'm sorry. I mean it. I apologize. Kousei: But you gotta understand; this is my first time too! I'm freaking out here! Natsume: Then make it up to me. Nhh... Natsume: Nhhh... Nh, mh... Nhh... Ah... That's the first time. Kousei: Huh? Natsume: The first time you've ever initiated a kiss. Kousei: Yeah, I guess so. Kousei: I'd better pay you back for all the times you've kissed me then... Nhh... Natsume: Ahmph... Hngh... *smack* *kiss*... Nhh... Nh... *kiss* *smooch*... Mhh... Kousei: No, they're perfect. And... super soft. Natsume: Ahh, nhh... Hngh... Nhhh... Kousei: Besides, it doesn't matter whether they're big or small. I don't care about size. Natsume: Is that supposed to be a compliment? Kousei: I dunno, to be honest. I think your boobs might be hypnotizing me. Kousei: They're so soft... and your nipples are such a beautiful pink too... It's really turning me on. Natsume: Well, um, I'm glad to hear it. Kousei: ...... Natsume: Stop staring at me in silence, will you? It's embarrassing. Kousei: Sorry, I didn't mean to. Kousei: *lick* *suck*... Your nipples are delicious, Natsume... Natsume: *pant* *pant*... It didn't hurt... Nhh... *pant*... Natsume: I just didn't expect it to feel this electrifying... *pant*... *pant*... Natsume: What's going to happen to me... if we go even further? Kousei: I don't know either. Kousei: But... I'm past the point of return. Kousei: It's... so pretty... Kousei: Well, I need to get a good look. Kousei: Don't wanna put it in the wrong hole, y'know... Natsume: Yeah, but... It doesn't look weird, does it? Kousei: It's beautiful. Seriously. That's the only word that comes to mind. Kousei: Is that not convincing enough for you? Natsume: No, I never said that... *pant* *pant*... *pant*... Urk... You're just staring so hard... Kousei: ...... Natsume: And now you go all quiet on me again. Kousei: Ah, err, sorry. I'm not doing it on purpose. I just can't tear my eyes away... Natsume: *pant*... *pant*... *pant*... *pant*... Kousei: Your vagina's so amazing. Natsume: Huh? What do you mean? Does it look weird? Kousei: No, of course not. Kousei: It's just, this is my first time doing any of this... All I can say is, it's amazing. Natsume: R-Really? Umm, how else would you describe it? Kousei: Let's see... Natsume: Delicious? What are you... N-No, wait. You're... Don't tell me you're... Ahh! Kousei: Nhh... *smooch* Natsume: Ngghhh?! Kousei: Your pussy? Natsume: Ngh! Don't say it outright! Natsume: You didn't hate putting your mouth on my p-pu... did you? You don't have to force yourself. Kousei: I don't hate it one bit. I love every part of you, Natsume. If anything, I want to lick it even more. Kousei: What about you, though? Do you not want me to lick it? Natsume: It's just... embarrassing. That's the worst part... but I don't mind it. Kousei: Alright. In that case... Natsume: Ahh?! Nghh... Mhh... Urk... Ahh! Kousei: *lick* *lick*... *slurp* Natsume: S-Sto... Not there... Ahh! It's too embarrassing... being licked there... Nhh! Natsume: Ah, *pant* *pant*... Do people usually have to go this far? Kousei: *lick... Not that I'd know... but I'm pretty sure this is a normal part of foreplay. Natsume: I'm just a little worried that you're getting most of your information from porn. Kousei: Well, judging from your reactions, it seems like you like this. Natsume: I mean... Kousei: Can I keep kissing you down here? I want to taste you even more, Natsume. Natsume: You promise you'll stop? Kousei: Sure... If I can pump the brakes in time. Kousei: But sorry in advance if I can't stop myself. I'm already on the verge of losing control as is. Kousei: *lick*... *lick* *slurp*... *kiss* *kiss*... *suck*... Natsume: Ahhh... Ahh, ah, ah... ahhh... Eeek?! Natsume: Ahhh?! Ahh... ah, ah, ah, ahhh! Kousei: I just tried focusing my kisses on a specific spot... *kiss* *suck* *kiss* *lick*... Natsume: Ahhh! W-Wait, not there... Noooo! My body's... tingling so much... Ahhh! Kousei: Nhh... Does it hurt? Natsume: It doesn't hurt, but I'm scared of how much my body's tingling. Kousei: Does that mean you want me to stop? Natsume: No, but... *pant* *pant*... A-Are you going to keep kissing me? Kousei: I thought you said you were scared? Natsume: I... I am... but you want to keep going, don't you? Kousei: Of course. But if you don't want me to, I won't; I'll stop here. Kousei: So tell me what you want, Natsume. Natsume: Urk... I-I know you already know what I'm going to say... Natsume: You're teasing me on purpose, aren't you? Kousei: That's not--completely untrue, I guess. Natsume: Nrgh... Kousei: But I don't want to do anything you don't like. That's the truth. Kousei: That's why I want you to say it clearly. Because once we go any further, I get the feeling I won't be able to stop myself. Natsume: Fine... Fine. Keep going. Natsume: I don't hate how much it tingles. It's a little scary, but I want you to keep going. Keep kissing me down there... Kousei: It's your own fault for being so wet down here. *lick* *lick* *kiss*... Natsume: Maybe, but you're definitely making those sounds on purpose... Ahhhh! Ah, ah, ah... ahh! Kousei: Wow... You just keep getting wetter and wetter... *lick* *smack*... Natsume: Ahhhh! I-I can't help it... You're kissing it in such a lewd way... Mhhhh! Kousei: I can be even lewder, you know. Natsume: Ah, ahh! Nooo... That's so dirty--ahh! Ahhh! Kousei: *suck* *slurp*... *lick* *lick*... *kiss*... Kousei: *kiss* *pant*... *pant*... *lick* *lick*... *kiss* *suck* Natsume: It feels, too good... I-I can't... *pant*... Hnghh! Natsume: What? *pant*... *pant*... S-Sorry... But if you keep kissing me like that, I... Hngghhh! Natsume: I can't, I can't, I can't... It feels too good! Ahhh, ahhh, eek! Kousei: Well, as long as I'm making you feel good, I'm happy... *suck* *lick*... Natsume: K-Keep... Keep licking my p-pu... that spot... Kiss it more. Kousei: *kiss*... *slurp* *suck*... Natsume: Ahhhhhh! Ah, ah, ahhh! Yes! That feels amazing... Ahhhhh! Kousei: Your reactions make me really happy, Natsume... *kiss* *lick* *lick*... *suck*... Natsume: Ah, ah! Nooo... No more... Ngh! I can't take this... Ahh! Natsume: S-Something's coming! Please, stop! Any more and I'll... Ah, ah, ahh! Kousei: Nhh... *suck* *slurp* *lick*... Natsume: Ahhh! I can't... I can't, I can't... ahh... I'm really gonna--! Natsume: Ah, ah, ahhhhhhhhhhhn! Kousei: You came, didn't you? Natsume: *pant*... *pant*... This is my first time... but I feel so happy... *pant* *pant* *pant* *pant*... Natsume: Wow... My head's gone all mushy... *pant* *pant*... Kousei: Should we take a little break? Natsume: Ngh... No... If we wait, I'll start getting scared again... Natsume: So let's keep going... Let's... have s-sex. Kousei: I haven't even put it in, though... Kousei: Wait--huh?! Don't tell me I just lost my virginity without even knowing it?! Natsume: Oh, hush, you idiot. That's not the only part of sex that feels good. Natsume: Just feeling each other's warmth like this... feels incredible... Kousei: Y-Yeah. Right, of course! Natsume: You're not listening to a word I'm saying, are you? Kousei: What do you want me to do? I'm just too excited about finally losing my virginity. Natsume: I mean, I get that, but still. Kousei: And I get to do it with the girl I love too. I couldn't be happier. Kousei: It's the only thing on my mind right now. Kousei: But you're sure about this, right? You want to go all the way with me? Natsume: Yeah. I want to go all the way. So hold me. Hold me tighter. Kousei: Sure thing. Natsume: It's a lot b-bigger than I thought... Kousei: I think I'm pretty average-sized, actually. Natsume: What?! R-Really? Kousei: Anyway... are you ready, Natsume? It's getting harder and harder to hold myself back. Natsume: I'm ready, but I want you to k-kiss me first. Kousei: I-In THIS position?! Natsume: No, you idiot. I don't mean down there... I mean a normal kiss. Nhh... Natsume: Ahh! *pant* *pant*... *pant*... M-My belly... feels so hot... Kousei: Ngh... Holy shit... Natsume: *pant* *pant*... I-It doesn't feel weird for you... does it? Kousei: Not at all. It feels amazing. Kousei: Your pussy is so warm, and the way it's sucking on me... it's squeezing me so tight. Kousei: And yet it's pulling me deeper still... I've never felt anything like this before. Seriously, it's amazing... Natsume: Me too... I've never... felt something so hot, so d-deep inside me before... Hngh... Kousei: Does it hurt? Natsume: A little bit, sure, but don't worry about me. And I doubt you're capable of stopping right now, right? Kousei: Yeah. Natsume: So I want you to kiss me instead. Make me forget about the pain. Keep me distracted. Kousei: Nhh... *kiss* Natsume: Urk... Nhh *kiss* *kiss*... *smooch*... *smack* *slurp*... Natsume: *pant* *pant*... *pant*... It doesn't hurt, so much as it feels strange... Natsume: Having this thing moving around inside of me is... *pant* *pant*... kind of amazing. Is it all the way inside? Kousei: Yeah. I think I'm all the way in. Kousei: I'm gonna start moving. Kousei: Nhh... *kiss* *smack*... Natsume: I love you... Ahhh... *kiss* *slurp*... I love you... *smooch* *swirl*... *kiss* *kiss*... Kousei: Am I moving too much for you? Natsume: N-No, I'm fine... *kiss*... Ahh, *pant* *pant*... It does hurt a little bit, but I can take it. Natsume: Ah, ah, ah... It hurts, but keep going... *pant* *pant*... What is this? Kousei: It makes me happy to know I'm making you feel good, Natsume. Natsume: It feels like I'm being split apart... like my insides are tingling... *pant*... It feels like it hurts, but it feels so good... Natsume: I-I'm... I'm not the only one feeling good, am I? Does it feel good for you? Kousei: Do you really need to ask? Your pussy feels incredible. It's making me go crazy. Natsume: Ahh?! Ah, hngh! N-Not so rough! Ah, ah, ah, ahh! Natsume: It's making... such a dirty sound! Nghhhh! Kousei: I think it's really hot, actually... You don't mind if I keep going, do you? *smooch* Natsume: Nghh... Mhh... *kiss* *kiss* *smack*... *lick* *smooch*... *kiss*... Kousei: I can't stop myself anymore, Natsume! Natsume: I can feel you... Mghh! Twitching, inside me... Nh, ngh! Stirring me up... Ah, ah, ah! Kousei: It feels way too good, kissing you up here and down there. Natsume: Ahhhh! Ah, ah, ah! You're kissing me... even deeper than before! Natsume: Hngh, ahhhh! Ahmph, *kiss* *smooch* *smack*... Nhh! Kousei: I love you, Natsume. I love you. Natsume: I love you too! Ah, ah, ahh... I love you, I love you! Natsume: It feels, so good... I want to stay like this forever... *kiss* *kiss*... *smack* *slurp*... Kousei: Natsume... If you keep kissing me like that... *smack* *kiss* *slurp*... Natsume: But it's distracting me from the pain... *kiss* *kiss* *smack*... *lick* *lick*... Kousei: Nhh! *kiss* *smooch*... *smack* Kousei: Does it hurt? Natsume: N-No... Something's... something's c-coming! It's coming... Ngghh! Natsume: It's my first time, but... Ahhhh! But I can't hold it back--ah! Ah, ah, ah, ah! Kousei: It makes me happier than anything to know that you're feeling good. In fact, it's turning me on even more. Natsume: Urk! At this rate, I'm gonna--mngh! *kiss* *smooch* *smooch* *smack*... *kiss* *kiss* Kousei: *kiss* Nh, mhh, nhh... Natsume: Ahh, I can't, I'm gonna... Ah, ah, ah! Hug me more! Tighter! Kousei: Natsume, I'm-- Natsume: Huh? W-Wait, I just... Ah?! Nooo... If you rub me right now, I'm gonna--! Natsume: Ngghhhh! Natsume: *pant* *pant*... I can't, I'm going crazy... *pant* *pant*... Kousei: Natsume... *kiss* Natsume: Mhhh, *smooch* *smack*... It's no use... Even if you kiss me, I... *smooch* *kiss* *kiss* *slurp*... Kousei: Hang in there. I'm about to cum too. Natsume: Ahhh! Ahh! Ahh! I'm gonna cum again! Kousei: Me too. This time, I'm gonna show you how I cum. Natsume: Show me... show me! I want to see you cum! Natsume: *pant* *pant*... Me too... I'm cumming again! Kiss me... kiss me! Kousei: *smooch* *kiss* *kiss* *smack*... *kiss* *smack*... Natsume: Nhhh! Ahh... *pant* *pant*... Ahmph, *kiss* *smooch* *slurp*! Kousei: Nhh, ahh... I'm cumming... Take it all! Natsume: I'll take it, I'll take it... So do it, inside--*kiss* *smack* *smack* *smooch*... Nhh, nghh! Kousei: Kh... ahh! I'm cumming, Natsume! Natsume: *smooch* *smooch* Nh, nhh, nhh, ngghhhh! Natsume: Nggggghhhhhhhhh! Natsume: Nh, nhh! Do it... I'm gonna cum again too! *kiss* *kiss* *smooch* *smooch*... Nhh, mhhhh! Kousei: Natsume! Natsume: *kiss* *kiss* *smack* *slurp* *smooch*... Nhhh, nh, ngghhhh! Natsume: Nggghhhhhhh! Kousei: Ngh, ahh... Natsume: *pant* *pant*... *pant*... I can hardly move... Kousei: Me too. Feels like I ejaculated every last bit of energy I had just now. Kousei: Just goes to show how turned on I was. And how much I love you. Natsume: Hey... I want another kiss... Kousei: Nhh... *kiss* *kiss*... *smooch*... Natsume: Mhh *smack*... Nh, nhhh... *kiss* *smooch*... \n\nWhile these examples may provide some guidance, evaluate their relevance to the current conversation.

            "Mikado: Is not about the carbonara, no. I shall leave that matter completely up to you. Kousei: Alright. I'll try preparing a few more dishes next week as an experiment. Maybe up the order limit to twenty-five. Kanna: Sounds good. Anyway, I'm sure you can guess why I've asked you two to stay behind. Mei: This is about my eye again, isn't it? Kanna: We just want to know how things are progressing, so this shouldn't take too much of your time. Has anything changed with your eye since we last spoke? Mei: No. I still don't know how to release my butterflies... Kanna: Not to worry. I'm certain you'll get there eventually. Mikado: Our main purpose in opening this cafe has always been to collect butterflies. Thanks to you, that task has been proceeding expeditiously. Mikado: Allow me to thank you for your hard work once again. We owe you our gratitude. Mei: A-All I'm doing is catching butterflies. I'd wouldn't exactly call that \"hard work\"... Mei: B-But either way, I'll continue to do my best to help! Mikado: Thank you. We appreciate it. Mei: ...... Mikado: But while I appreciate your efforts, I will not be transforming into a cat. Mei: Okay. I'm sorry. Kanna: Allow me to thank you as well, Takamine-san. Kousei: Huh? Why me? Kanna: While it was mere coincidence that brought you here to work with us, you've become an invaluable member of our team. Kanna: Many of our customers even come to our cafe specifically to eat your dishes now. Kanna: So thank you very much. You've been an incredible help to us all. Kousei: Well, I mean... this was all because of that \"problem\" I had with my soul in the first place... Kousei: But I'm glad you appreciate me. Honestly, this job has been pretty fulfilling for me too lately. Mikado: Indeed. It would appear your soul's condition has been greatly improving. Kanna: You can't let your guard down just yet, but as long as you keep heading in the right direction, you won't have anything to worry about. Kousei: Phew. That's a relief to hear. I owe it all to Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Huh? Kousei: Thanks for guiding me in the right direction. Mei: N-No, I didn't do anything. Kousei: You did. Thank you for everything. Mei: I-I... Mei: ...... Mei: U-Um, was there anything else you wanted to discuss? Kanna: No, I believe that's it. Mei: In that case, I've got something I need to do, so--! Mikado: Alright. Then we apologize for keeping you. Mei: That's okay! Anyway, I'll be going now! Kousei: Let me walk you-- Mei: Good night! Kousei: Huh? Kousei: Y-Yeah, I am... Kanna: Good night. Kousei: Yeah. Good night... Kousei: ...... Kousei: I should've known... Mei: Y-You're fine. Kousei: Freaking out? Mei: Y-Yeah... I... Um... Mei: ...... Mei: Oh, gosh... I'm so nervous... Mei: U-Umm... I think it would take too long to explain myself, so... h-here! Mei: Yes. It's... my Valentine's Day gift... to you. Kousei: Chocolate! Mei: Y-Yes. It's chocolate, and it's, um... handmade. Kousei: Handmade! Mei: Wow, you're really excited about this... Suzune-san taught me how to make it, so it should taste alright... I think. Kousei: Oh... Is that why you've been going home together lately? Mei: Yeah. I've been going to her apartment so she could teach me. Mei: She's also been helping me by asking you about your preferences and stuff... Kousei: My preferences? Oh, wait. Mei: Ahaha... Sorry. I guess I just felt kind of embarrassed... Kousei: Is that why the others said they weren't giving me any chocolate this year? So this would be a surprise? Mei: What? I don't know anything about that... Mei: But the others knew I was planning on giving you my own chocolate, so... I guess that could be why they did that... Kousei: Phew. I thought for sure you hated me or something... Mei: Wh-What?! Of course not! Why would you think that? Kousei: I mean, you've been avoiding me lately, haven't you? Mei: I-I wasn't... I mean... Well, maybe a little... Kousei: See? Mei: That's only because I didn't want you to find out I was preparing chocolate for you... Mei: But... I'm sorry for acting so weird. I didn't mean to give you the wrong idea. Kousei: It's alright. I've been really anxious these past few days, so it's a relief to know the truth. Mei: Urk... I'm sorry... Kousei: Handmade chocolate, though... This is more than I expected. Thank you. Mei: Um, if you'd like... you're welcome to go ahead and eat it... Kousei: Right now? Mei: Yeah. I actually brought you a fork too. Kousei: To be honest, I was planning to go home and savor it there... Mei: N-No, please! You can't! You can't keep me waiting that long! Mei: My heart's already pounding so fast it's about to explode! Mei: I need to know how you think it tastes right now... or else I'm going to die! Kousei: A-Alright. I'll have a bite... Mei: Please do! There are two inside, so at least try one of them! Right now! Mei: Something like that. It's called a chocolate fondant. Kousei: Sounds fancy. Was it hard to make? Mei: Not at all. Suzune-san was there to guide me through every single step. Mei: Ah, but just for the record--I made this all by myself! And I think I did a pretty good job! Mei: Though, um... it was a lot crispier on the outside when it came out of the oven, but it might be a bit soggy by now. Mei: But it shouldn't taste bad! This was Suzune-san's own personal recipe! I baked it with the utmost care! Mei: The flavor should be to your liking as well! So p-please, go ahead and try some! Kousei: Alright... don't mind if I do then. Mei: H-Help yourself! Kousei: ...... Mei: H-Hello? Kousei: ...... Mei: Senpai? Kousei: ...... Mei: Um... Does it... taste bad? Kousei: It's delicious. Mei: R-Really? Oh, thank goodness! Kousei: Oh god... It's so delicious... Mei: Wait, what? Huh? Kousei: How? How can something taste THIS good?! Mei: O-Oh, come on... You're exaggerating... Kousei: *sniffle*... Mei: Wait, are you crying? You're not pretending, are you? No way. Like, seriously? You're seriously crying? Kousei: I can't help it... Mei: O-Okay? Kousei: Everyone kept saying they wouldn't be giving me any chocolate... Mei: Oh... right. They said it'd be a hassle to get return gifts for everyone. Kousei: Even Nozomi, who usually gives me chocolates every year... gave me nothing. Mei: Wait, every year? Oh, right. You and Nozomi-chan are childhood friends. Kousei: Yeah, but she said she'd only been giving them to me out of force of habit... Mei: Oh... Err... I'm not sure what to say to that. Kousei: In the end, the only person who gave me chocolates was you... And handmade chocolate too... Kousei: Thank you... Thank you, Hiuchidani-san! Mei: I didn't think you'd be THIS emotional... but I'm glad you like it. Mei: But I can't say I was expecting you to start crying... It's a little, um, creepy. Kousei: Yeah, I know. I guess I tried too hard to sell it. Mei: Ah! I KNEW you were pretending, you stinker! Mei: Do you really mean that? Kousei: Yeah. I mean it. Seriously. Kousei: I could finish off both these chocolates right here if I'm not careful. Mei: Phew... Kousei: There's no way you could've gone wrong with Suzune-san's recipe. Mei: Yeah, but still... Kousei: Besides, even if it DID taste bad, I'd never say it to your face. Mei: What? So it really DOES taste bad?! Kousei: No, no. It's delicious. Really. Mei: *sigh*... My heart's pounding so much. Like, I've been feeling so anxious lately. That's why I've been acting so weird... Mei: When I was making the chocolate by hand, I began to understand how you feel, Senpai. Mei: Making food for someone else to eat is incredibly stressful and nerve-wracking... Mei: But it's also really fun, trying to make something that the person will like. Mei: And when you do get that confirmation from them that they like it... Mei: It makes you happier than words can describe! Kousei: I already told you. Why don't you believe me? Mei: Because I'm worried! Kousei: Didn't you taste it yourself beforehand? Mei: Well, yeah. I tried one I made from the same batch, but still... Kousei: It was delicious, wasn't it? Mei: It was, but this one's gone all cold! It's not FRESH! Kousei: Even so, it tastes delicious. Mei: Really? Really, really? Kousei: If you're really that worried about the taste, why don't you try some yourself? Kousei: See? I told you. Mei: Phew... Wait. Ah... Ahh! Kousei: What? Mei: Th-Th-Th-That was... an i-i-indirect k-ki--! Kousei: Oh, right. Sorry. You're pretty sensitive about these sorts of things, aren't you? Mei: O-O-Oh, no! It doesn't bothe--well... i-it does, I guess... Kousei: My bad. I totally forgot. Mei: I-I mean... As long as it's you, I... Mei: ...... Mei: U-U-Umm! Kousei: Hm? Mei: Suzune-san told me something... Kousei: Yeah? Mei: She said that you'd be happy receiving any kind of chocolate for Valentine's Day... Kousei: It's true. I'm pretty thrilled right now. Thank you, seriously. Mei: You're welcome... But she also said that... if I gave you handmade chocolate... Mei: Then... Umm... Kousei: Hm? Mei: Then you'd... umm! Kousei: Yeah? Mei: You'd think that... it meant I had genuine feelings for you... Kousei: O-Oh, come on! I can't believe she told you that too! Mei: Y-Yes... That's what she said... Kousei: I, er, I mean... I was only half-joking when I said that... Mei: You were... joking? Kousei: Y-Yeah. I was just messing with her... Kousei: B-But don't worry! I'm not dumb enough to think you like me just because of a couple chocolates! Mei: ...... Mei: I wouldn't mind... if you thought I did... though. Kousei: O-Okay? Kousei: ...... Kousei: Wait, what?! Mei: ...... Kousei: ...... Kousei: ...... Mei: Um... Mei: ...... Mei: During our girls' night out the other day... everyone kept asking me about that time we went to the pool together... Mei: Eventually, the conversation turned to... whether or not I had f-feelings for you, Senpai... Mei: I said I didn't know... but everyone else said it was obvious that I did... Mei: I thought they might be right... but I've never had any sort of romantic experience before... so I wasn't sure. Mei: I can't say I really understand my own feelings... but at the very least, I do know that you're a very important person to me. Mei: That's... what I wanted to tell you today. Mei: But... Mei: ...... Mei: Just now, I realized that... I really do... love you, Senpai. Mei: I mean, love is supposed to make your heart pound, isn't it? But when I'm with you, it's almost the opposite... I feel so relaxed that I thought it couldn't be love. Mei: But right now... my heart is pounding like crazy. Even though all I'm doing is telling you how I feel... my chest feels like it's about to burst. Mei: When I made up my mind to give you these chocolates... and when I decided to ask Suzune-san to teach me how to make them... Mei: While I practiced... This morning... During work... And while I was sitting here waiting for you earlier too... Mei: My heart wouldn't stop pounding. Mei: You wouldn't believe how nervous I felt. Mei: The truth is... I've had feelings for you all this time. Mei: So it's time I worked up the courage to say it. Mei: I... I think I love you, Senpai. Mei: No, wait... That doesn't sound right... Mei: ...... Mei: Senpai... I love you. Mei: I love the way you thank me, even when I've barely done anything... Mei: I love the way you're so nice to me, and lend an ear to all my worries... Mei: And I love so many other things about you too. Mei: So please... Mei: ...... Mei: Please... go out with me. Mei: Please... take me as your girlfriend. Mei: I... want to be with you from now on, Senpai. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Right now... my heart's also hammering like crazy. Kousei: When I thought you were avoiding me... it made me feel so lonely and so worried. Kousei: I was afraid you didn't like me, and I became really depressed. Kousei: Especially when you ran off without giving me any chocolate. Kousei: But then--you messaged to ask if we could meet. My heart wouldn't stop pounding on the way here. Kousei: This whole day's been a roller coaster of emotions for me. Kousei: But if what I'm feeling is the same thing you are... then I'm in love too. Kousei: In love with you, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Ah... Urk... Kousei: I love you too, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: S-So... Kousei: I want you to go out with me. Mei: ...... Mei: Ahhh... Mei: I'm a total mess of emotions right now... Kousei: Me too... My face must be burning up right now. Mei: ...... Kousei: ...... Mei: ...... Kousei: Uh... if you don't mind... Mei: Huh? Kousei: Could I call you by your first name? It'd feel oddly formal... if I kept using your last name. Mei: Y-Yeah, I agree... Go ahead. You don't have to use an honorific either... if you don't want. Kousei: Oh... Mei: Yeah. You can just call me Mei. Kousei: M... M-M-M... Mei: You're stammering so much... Kousei: I-I can't help it. I've never called you this before... Mei: That's fine. I can be patient. Kousei: M-Mei... Mei: There you go. Ehehe... Kousei: What about you? Mei: Huh? Kousei: Will you start calling me by my name? Mei: Senpai? Kousei: That's not what it says on my birth certificate. Mei: Urk... Mei: ...... Mei: Kousei... san? Kousei: You can drop the honorific too. Mei: Well... I mean, I'm younger than you, so... Mei: But maybe I could call you Kou-kun instead-- Mei: No, wait. That's even more embarrassing. Kousei: Yeah... That's pretty embarrassing for me too. Mei: Well, for now... I'm only going to use your first name when we're alone together. Kousei: A-Alright. I guess we wouldn't want the others to tease us about it. Mei: E-Exactly. Kousei: ...... Mei: ...... Kousei: Y-Yeah. I mean, if that's okay with you... Mei: O-Of course it is! Mei: ...... Mei: Finally... I'm your girlfriend! ",

Mei: I wouldn't mind... if you thought I did... though. Kousei: O-Okay? Kousei: ...... Kousei: Wait, what?! Mei: ...... Kousei: ...... Kousei: ...... Mei: Um... Mei: ...... Mei: During our girls' night out the other day... everyone kept asking me about that time we went to the pool together... Mei: Eventually, the conversation turned to... whether or not I had f-feelings for you, Senpai... Mei: I said I didn't know... but everyone else said it was obvious that I did... Mei: I thought they might be right... but I've never had any sort of romantic experience before... so I wasn't sure. Mei: I can't say I really understand my own feelings... but at the very least, I do know that you're a very important person to me. Mei: That's... what I wanted to tell you today. Mei: But... Mei: ...... Mei: Just now, I realized that... I really do... love you, Senpai. Mei: I mean, love is supposed to make your heart pound, isn't it? But when I'm with you, it's almost the opposite... I feel so relaxed that I thought it couldn't be love. Mei: But right now... my heart is pounding like crazy. Even though all I'm doing is telling you how I feel... my chest feels like it's about to burst. Mei: When I made up my mind to give you these chocolates... and when I decided to ask Suzune-san to teach me how to make them... Mei: While I practiced... This morning... During work... And while I was sitting here waiting for you earlier too... Mei: My heart wouldn't stop pounding. Mei: You wouldn't believe how nervous I felt. Mei: The truth is... I've had feelings for you all this time. Mei: So it's time I worked up the courage to say it. Mei: I... I think I love you, Senpai. Mei: No, wait... That doesn't sound right... Mei: ...... Mei: Senpai... I love you. Mei: I love the way you thank me, even when I've barely done anything... Mei: I love the way you're so nice to me, and lend an ear to all my worries... Mei: And I love so many other things about you too. Mei: So please... Mei: ...... Mei: Please... go out with me. Mei: Please... take me as your girlfriend. Mei: I... want to be with you from now on, Senpai. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Right now... my heart's also hammering like crazy. Kousei: When I thought you were avoiding me... it made me feel so lonely and so worried. Kousei: I was afraid you didn't like me, and I became really depressed. Kousei: Especially when you ran off without giving me any chocolate. Kousei: But then--you messaged to ask if we could meet. My heart wouldn't stop pounding on the way here. Kousei: This whole day's been a roller coaster of emotions for me. Kousei: But if what I'm feeling is the same thing you are... then I'm in love too. Kousei: In love with you, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Ah... Urk... Kousei: I love you too, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: S-So... Kousei: I want you to go out with me. Mei: ...... Mei: Ahhh... Mei: I'm a total mess of emotions right now... Kousei: Me too... My face must be burning up right now. Mei: ...... Kousei: ...... Mei: ...... Kousei: Uh... if you don't mind... Mei: Huh? Kousei: Could I call you by your first name? It'd feel oddly formal... if I kept using your last name. Mei: Y-Yeah, I agree... Go ahead. You don't have to use an honorific either... if you don't want. Kousei: Oh... Mei: Yeah. You can just call me Mei. Kousei: M... M-M-M... Mei: You're stammering so much... Kousei: I-I can't help it. I've never called you this before... Mei: That's fine. I can be patient. Kousei: M-Mei... Mei: There you go. Ehehe... Kousei: What about you? Mei: Huh? Kousei: Will you start calling me by my name? Mei: Senpai? Kousei: That's not what it says on my birth certificate. Mei: Urk... Mei: ...... Mei: Kousei... san? Kousei: You can drop the honorific too. Mei: Well... I mean, I'm younger than you, so... Mei: But maybe I could call you Kou-kun instead-- Mei: No, wait. That's even more embarrassing. Kousei: Yeah... That's pretty embarrassing for me too. Mei: Well, for now... I'm only going to use your first name when we're alone together. Kousei: A-Alright. I guess we wouldn't want the others to tease us about it. Mei: E-Exactly. Kousei: ...... Mei: ...... Kousei: Y-Yeah. I mean, if that's okay with you... Mei: O-Of course it is! Mei: ...... Mei: Finally... I'm your girlfriend! , Suzune: Hey there. Kanna: Good morning. Kousei: H-Hey, Akizuki-san. Kanna: Akizuki-san, you said? Kousei: Urk... Kanna: What are you, scared? Kousei: No, I'm not! Kousei: G-Good morning, Kanna. Kanna: Good morning to you too, Kousei-san. , Kanna: Just quit bellyaching and go already, Takamine-san. Natsume: Of course not. Why are you being so negative? Natsume: If anything, she'd be disappointed if you refused to go with her. You don't have to be a girl to understand that. Kousei: Fine. I'll try asking Nozomi herself then. Kousei: What?! That's a little inconsiderate, don't you think?! Natsume: I doubt she'll mind if it's you. Suzune: Enough excuses already. Get going! Kousei: Alright, alright. Fine. Kanna: Mikado-san? You can come out now. Mikado: Good grief. I would highly appreciate if you kept me out of your silly schemes. Kanna: Now, now. Just think of this as our Christmas present to Takamine-san. Suzune: All this work to set up a single date. Natsume: Alright. Back to work, everyone. Kousei: Hey! Nozomi! Nozomiii! Nozomi: What are you doing here? I thought you were at work! Kousei: Well, about that... Nozomi: They totally were! I just know it! Kousei: Huh? Why do you say that? Nozomi: Don't you think it's fishy? Why would Mikado-san suddenly disappear, knowing full well how busy the cafe would be today? Nozomi: Especially since he knew Mei-chan and I wouldn't be working today. Kousei: Yeah, I guess I see what you mean... Nozomi: What it is, Kousei-kun? Kousei: Look at this. Nozomi: Now there's something I haven't heard before... Kousei: I don't think it's a common expression, no. Nozomi: R-Right. If we really do go to Mouse Land together, then-- Nozomi: Th-That means I'll be taking your f-first time! Nozomi: Come to think of it, this means I'll be giving you my dating v-virginity too! Nozomi: Ahhhhhh! I can't believe this is happening! Nozomi: That time my late-blooming older childhood friend was reincarnated in another world as a cunning playboy! Kousei: What is this, some light novel? Kousei: You can call someone else right now to go with you. Kousei: You've got tons of friends, right? At least one of them must be free tonight. \n\nWhile these examples may provide some guidance, evaluate their relevance to the current conversation.

            "Mikado: Is not about the carbonara, no. I shall leave that matter completely up to you. Kousei: Alright. I'll try preparing a few more dishes next week as an experiment. Maybe up the order limit to twenty-five. Kanna: Sounds good. Anyway, I'm sure you can guess why I've asked you two to stay behind. Mei: This is about my eye again, isn't it? Kanna: We just want to know how things are progressing, so this shouldn't take too much of your time. Has anything changed with your eye since we last spoke? Mei: No. I still don't know how to release my butterflies... Kanna: Not to worry. I'm certain you'll get there eventually. Mikado: Our main purpose in opening this cafe has always been to collect butterflies. Thanks to you, that task has been proceeding expeditiously. Mikado: Allow me to thank you for your hard work once again. We owe you our gratitude. Mei: A-All I'm doing is catching butterflies. I'd wouldn't exactly call that \"hard work\"... Mei: B-But either way, I'll continue to do my best to help! Mikado: Thank you. We appreciate it. Mei: ...... Mikado: But while I appreciate your efforts, I will not be transforming into a cat. Mei: Okay. I'm sorry. Kanna: Allow me to thank you as well, Takamine-san. Kousei: Huh? Why me? Kanna: While it was mere coincidence that brought you here to work with us, you've become an invaluable member of our team. Kanna: Many of our customers even come to our cafe specifically to eat your dishes now. Kanna: So thank you very much. You've been an incredible help to us all. Kousei: Well, I mean... this was all because of that \"problem\" I had with my soul in the first place... Kousei: But I'm glad you appreciate me. Honestly, this job has been pretty fulfilling for me too lately. Mikado: Indeed. It would appear your soul's condition has been greatly improving. Kanna: You can't let your guard down just yet, but as long as you keep heading in the right direction, you won't have anything to worry about. Kousei: Phew. That's a relief to hear. I owe it all to Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Huh? Kousei: Thanks for guiding me in the right direction. Mei: N-No, I didn't do anything. Kousei: You did. Thank you for everything. Mei: I-I... Mei: ...... Mei: U-Um, was there anything else you wanted to discuss? Kanna: No, I believe that's it. Mei: In that case, I've got something I need to do, so--! Mikado: Alright. Then we apologize for keeping you. Mei: That's okay! Anyway, I'll be going now! Kousei: Let me walk you-- Mei: Good night! Kousei: Huh? Kousei: Y-Yeah, I am... Kanna: Good night. Kousei: Yeah. Good night... Kousei: ...... Kousei: I should've known... Mei: Y-You're fine. Kousei: Freaking out? Mei: Y-Yeah... I... Um... Mei: ...... Mei: Oh, gosh... I'm so nervous... Mei: U-Umm... I think it would take too long to explain myself, so... h-here! Mei: Yes. It's... my Valentine's Day gift... to you. Kousei: Chocolate! Mei: Y-Yes. It's chocolate, and it's, um... handmade. Kousei: Handmade! Mei: Wow, you're really excited about this... Suzune-san taught me how to make it, so it should taste alright... I think. Kousei: Oh... Is that why you've been going home together lately? Mei: Yeah. I've been going to her apartment so she could teach me. Mei: She's also been helping me by asking you about your preferences and stuff... Kousei: My preferences? Oh, wait. Mei: Ahaha... Sorry. I guess I just felt kind of embarrassed... Kousei: Is that why the others said they weren't giving me any chocolate this year? So this would be a surprise? Mei: What? I don't know anything about that... Mei: But the others knew I was planning on giving you my own chocolate, so... I guess that could be why they did that... Kousei: Phew. I thought for sure you hated me or something... Mei: Wh-What?! Of course not! Why would you think that? Kousei: I mean, you've been avoiding me lately, haven't you? Mei: I-I wasn't... I mean... Well, maybe a little... Kousei: See? Mei: That's only because I didn't want you to find out I was preparing chocolate for you... Mei: But... I'm sorry for acting so weird. I didn't mean to give you the wrong idea. Kousei: It's alright. I've been really anxious these past few days, so it's a relief to know the truth. Mei: Urk... I'm sorry... Kousei: Handmade chocolate, though... This is more than I expected. Thank you. Mei: Um, if you'd like... you're welcome to go ahead and eat it... Kousei: Right now? Mei: Yeah. I actually brought you a fork too. Kousei: To be honest, I was planning to go home and savor it there... Mei: N-No, please! You can't! You can't keep me waiting that long! Mei: My heart's already pounding so fast it's about to explode! Mei: I need to know how you think it tastes right now... or else I'm going to die! Kousei: A-Alright. I'll have a bite... Mei: Please do! There are two inside, so at least try one of them! Right now! Mei: Something like that. It's called a chocolate fondant. Kousei: Sounds fancy. Was it hard to make? Mei: Not at all. Suzune-san was there to guide me through every single step. Mei: Ah, but just for the record--I made this all by myself! And I think I did a pretty good job! Mei: Though, um... it was a lot crispier on the outside when it came out of the oven, but it might be a bit soggy by now. Mei: But it shouldn't taste bad! This was Suzune-san's own personal recipe! I baked it with the utmost care! Mei: The flavor should be to your liking as well! So p-please, go ahead and try some! Kousei: Alright... don't mind if I do then. Mei: H-Help yourself! Kousei: ...... Mei: H-Hello? Kousei: ...... Mei: Senpai? Kousei: ...... Mei: Um... Does it... taste bad? Kousei: It's delicious. Mei: R-Really? Oh, thank goodness! Kousei: Oh god... It's so delicious... Mei: Wait, what? Huh? Kousei: How? How can something taste THIS good?! Mei: O-Oh, come on... You're exaggerating... Kousei: *sniffle*... Mei: Wait, are you crying? You're not pretending, are you? No way. Like, seriously? You're seriously crying? Kousei: I can't help it... Mei: O-Okay? Kousei: Everyone kept saying they wouldn't be giving me any chocolate... Mei: Oh... right. They said it'd be a hassle to get return gifts for everyone. Kousei: Even Nozomi, who usually gives me chocolates every year... gave me nothing. Mei: Wait, every year? Oh, right. You and Nozomi-chan are childhood friends. Kousei: Yeah, but she said she'd only been giving them to me out of force of habit... Mei: Oh... Err... I'm not sure what to say to that. Kousei: In the end, the only person who gave me chocolates was you... And handmade chocolate too... Kousei: Thank you... Thank you, Hiuchidani-san! Mei: I didn't think you'd be THIS emotional... but I'm glad you like it. Mei: But I can't say I was expecting you to start crying... It's a little, um, creepy. Kousei: Yeah, I know. I guess I tried too hard to sell it. Mei: Ah! I KNEW you were pretending, you stinker! Mei: Do you really mean that? Kousei: Yeah. I mean it. Seriously. Kousei: I could finish off both these chocolates right here if I'm not careful. Mei: Phew... Kousei: There's no way you could've gone wrong with Suzune-san's recipe. Mei: Yeah, but still... Kousei: Besides, even if it DID taste bad, I'd never say it to your face. Mei: What? So it really DOES taste bad?! Kousei: No, no. It's delicious. Really. Mei: *sigh*... My heart's pounding so much. Like, I've been feeling so anxious lately. That's why I've been acting so weird... Mei: When I was making the chocolate by hand, I began to understand how you feel, Senpai. Mei: Making food for someone else to eat is incredibly stressful and nerve-wracking... Mei: But it's also really fun, trying to make something that the person will like. Mei: And when you do get that confirmation from them that they like it... Mei: It makes you happier than words can describe! Kousei: I already told you. Why don't you believe me? Mei: Because I'm worried! Kousei: Didn't you taste it yourself beforehand? Mei: Well, yeah. I tried one I made from the same batch, but still... Kousei: It was delicious, wasn't it? Mei: It was, but this one's gone all cold! It's not FRESH! Kousei: Even so, it tastes delicious. Mei: Really? Really, really? Kousei: If you're really that worried about the taste, why don't you try some yourself? Kousei: See? I told you. Mei: Phew... Wait. Ah... Ahh! Kousei: What? Mei: Th-Th-Th-That was... an i-i-indirect k-ki--! Kousei: Oh, right. Sorry. You're pretty sensitive about these sorts of things, aren't you? Mei: O-O-Oh, no! It doesn't bothe--well... i-it does, I guess... Kousei: My bad. I totally forgot. Mei: I-I mean... As long as it's you, I... Mei: ...... Mei: U-U-Umm! Kousei: Hm? Mei: Suzune-san told me something... Kousei: Yeah? Mei: She said that you'd be happy receiving any kind of chocolate for Valentine's Day... Kousei: It's true. I'm pretty thrilled right now. Thank you, seriously. Mei: You're welcome... But she also said that... if I gave you handmade chocolate... Mei: Then... Umm... Kousei: Hm? Mei: Then you'd... umm! Kousei: Yeah? Mei: You'd think that... it meant I had genuine feelings for you... Kousei: O-Oh, come on! I can't believe she told you that too! Mei: Y-Yes... That's what she said... Kousei: I, er, I mean... I was only half-joking when I said that... Mei: You were... joking?

            "Kousei: Morning, everyone. Suzune: Hey. Kanna: Good morning, Takamine-san. Kousei: How are the Yule Logs coming along? Suzune: We're about 80\\% done, I think. Kousei: Is there anything I can help with? Suzune: Wanna start prepping the cheesecakes for me? You remember how to do it, don't you? Kousei: Yeah. Kanna: I'll help out as well. Just tell me what to do. Kousei: Aren't you helping with the Yule Logs, though? Kanna: We've already finished rolling them into log-shapes. All that's left is to add the external decorations, but only Suzune-san is skilled enough to do that. Suzune: I'll be fine. You can go ahead and help him. Kousei: Alright. Mei: Whoa! An actual Yule Log! It looks absolutely scrumptious! Nozomi: Are you finished making them? Suzune: For today, at least. Phew... My shoulders are killing me. Kanna: I'm not surprised. You had to put the finishing touches on all of them. Natsume: Well, they certainly turned out great. Thanks for all your hard work. Kousei: We're not very busy right now, so feel free to take a break if you want, Suzune-san. Suzune: Thanks. I'll take you up on that then. Kanna: Of course. Natsume: Now then, let's get these cakes boxed up. Nozomi & Mei: Okaaay! Mei: Welcome to Cafe Stella! Party of two? If you'd rather not wait, we do have a couple counter seats available right now. Would that be alright? Nozomi: Welcome to Cafe Stella! Ah, you placed an order for two Yule Logs under the name Ota? I'll have them ready for you in just a moment. Natsume: Two pancakes, a blend coffee, and a Guatemalan coffee? I'll have those right out to you. Natsume: Two coffees; house blend and Guatemalan, please. Mikado: Coming right up. Kanna: Oh, Natsume-san! I need to go fetch some more Yule Logs from the kitchen. Can you cover for me while I'm gone? Natsume: I'll go fetch them instead. I need to put in another order anyway. Kanna: Alright, that'd be great. Thank you. Kanna: I apologize for the delay, sir. We'll have them ready in just a minute, so please be patient. Natsume: Order coming in. Two plates of pancakes, please. Kousei: Got it. Suzune: How are the Yule Logs selling? Natsume: Fairly well. Most of the customers who've placed advance orders have arrived to pick them up too. Suzune: Phew. That's a relief... Kousei: Were you that worried? Suzune: Well, yeah. I don't know if they're pranks or what, but sometimes you'll get large orders and then the customer never comes to pick it up. Kousei: That kind of stuff actually happens? I've read stories online, but it's scary how easy it is for a single person to screw you over. Suzune: Fortunately, it doesn't look like that's the case this time. Suzune: Anyway, back to work. Pancakes, was it? Kousei: Yeah. I'll handle them. Suzune: You will? Well, okay. Natsume: I'd better get these Yule Logs delivered too. Suzune: I'll help you carry them. I want to see how our customers are doing anyway. Mei: Welcome to Cafe Stella! Miyama: Hello again. Mei: Oh? You're Yuina-chan's--ah, I beg your pardon. Hello there, Mister Miyama. Miyama: Oh, you don't need to be so formal. Miyama: Actually, I'm also here to pick up a cake that I ordered. Mei: A Yule Log, yes? Wait right here; I'll have it out to you in one moment. Suzune: Welcome. Miyama: Hello again. I just can't ignore your cakes, they're so good. Miyama: My daughter's been looking forward to this for a while too. She says no other cake shop will do. Suzune: I'm flattered. I sincerely hope it's to your liking. Miyama: Oh, no need to worry about that. I'm confident it will be every bit as delicious as all the others I've had before. I'm looking forward to it as well. Suzune: Thank you very much. Your praise means a lot to me. Miyama: Oh, and before I forget. Could I also get some shortcakes, fruit tarts... this cheesecake here... and some mousse cakes, as well? Miyama: Four of each. I'm planning to give them to a few acquaintances as gifts. I'd like more people to see how delicious your cakes are. Especially since it's Christmas Eve, you know. Suzune: Would you like us to include some sort of message? It wouldn't take much time to add a simple plaque to it. Miyama: Oh, no. They're just going to be small gifts for some of my coworkers. I have to get back there once I'm done here. Suzune: It seems like you'll have quite a lot to carry, though... Miyama: Maybe, but I'll manage somehow. The hospital is only a few minutes' walk from here. Suzune: Alright. Mei: Here you are, Mister Miyama. Suzune: Ah, Mei-san. He'd also like shortcakes, fruit tarts, cheesecakes, and champagne mousses. Four of each. Mei: O-Oh, sure! I'll add those to your order. Mei: Let's see... In that case, your total comes to 11,820 yen. Miyama: Alright. One second... Wait, where's my wallet? What? Miyama: Ahh, right. I put it in my bag earlier. Phew. There it is. Miyama: My apologies. Mei: No problem, sir. Now then, you paid with 12,000 yen, so your change comes to 180 yen. Here you are. Miyama: Thank you very much. Suzune: Since you've got quite a few cakes, we separated them into two boxes for you. Miyama: Thank you. Suzune: Thank you for coming, and have a good day. Mei: Come visit us again sometime! Mei: Is he going to be okay with all those cakes? He's not going to get sick, is he? Suzune: They're not all for him. He said he's giving them as gifts to some of his coworkers. Mei: Oh, that makes sense. I guess there's nothing to worry about then. Mei: Ah--welcome to Cafe Stella! Suzune: You know, honestly, it's a lot easier making cakes than dealing with customers. Kousei: How are things looking out there? Suzune: Excellent. Everyone seems as happy as a clam. Suzune: But more importantly, why don't you take a break soon? Things are starting to wind down now. Kousei: Alright. Just let me finish up with this and I will. Kousei: Phew... Mikado: Understood. In that case, we will hold on to it for the meantime. Kousei: Yeah. Mikado: Yes... Yes... Kousei: Is there some kind of problem? Nozomi: Apparently one of our customers forgot something at the cafe, so they called to make sure it's still here. Nozomi: Yeah. They left in a rush so they wouldn't be holding up any other customers. You know how busy the cafe is today, with everyone coming in to pick up their cakes. Mikado: I understand. We'll be waiting. Goodbye. Nozomi: Are they coming back to get it? Mikado: Yes. However, he says that he is rather busy at work at the moment, so he does not know when that will be. Kousei: Then should we keep the bag in the fridge in the meantime? Mikado: No need. I am told it merely contains a Christmas present for his daughter. Kousei: Oh. But if so, he'll need to come get it by tonight. Kousei: As a parent, he's got to be feeling pretty anxious. Nozomi: Probably, yeah. Mikado: Hmm. Would you be willing to deliver it to him for us, Takamine Kousei? Nozomi: Oh, you're right! We can just bring it to him instead! Kousei: I guess I don't mind. Does he live around here? Mikado: You remember the little girl named Miyama Yuina who came to order a cake for her father's birthday, don't you? Mikado: The customer who forgot this present is her father. Kousei: Ahh. So that means I'll be going to the Miwa General Hospital? Mikado: Indeed. It might ruin the surprise for little Yuina if you were to deliver to their house instead. Nozomi: That's probably why her dad wanted to come pick it up himself. Mikado: Yes. Kousei: But that's enough reminiscing. I have a job to do. Kousei: No, I'm looking for a Dr. Miyama. I'm here to return something he forgot. Female Nurse: Ahh. Yes, I've been told. Female Nurse: Please give me a moment. He said he'd like to thank you in person. Female Nurse: He says he'll be with you in a minute. Would you mind waiting? It won't be long. Kousei: Sure. Kousei: Huh? Oh, I'm sorry. I was spacing out a little. Miyama: That's quite alright. I'm the one who should be apologizing. Some father I am, forgetting my own daughter's Christmas present. Miyama: Thank you for returning it to me. I truly appreciate it. Kousei: It was no big deal. Kousei: Can I ask you a question, though? These drawings--they haven't always been here, have they? Miyama: Oh, have they not? They were here when I first started working here. ???: Oh? Dr. Miyama? What are you doing out here? ",
            "Mikado: The digital age truly is a wondrous thing! Nozomi: I could take over for you while you-- Kanna: Oh, no. We need you to keep selling those crepes, Nozomi-san. Kanna: A cute shrine maiden selling crepes is our main selling point, after all. Suzune: Yep. Don't you worry about Kousei; he just loooves wrapping crepes! It's the very reason he was born on this earth. Kousei: You couldn't give me a better backstory than that, Suzune-san? Suzune: Oh, hush. Keep wrapping! Wrap like your life depends on it! Kousei: It's time I showed you the true power of a crepe-wrapping king! Kousei: Aghhhhhhhhh! Kanna: Nihihi. It looks like seeing your face was all the motivation he needed. Nozomi: Huh?! O-Oh, stop it... Kanna: Aww! You make an even cuter shrine maiden when you're embarrassed! Nozomi: Come on, Kanna-san. Stop teasing me... Nozomi: Okay! Kanna: We'll get right on it. Kousei: Well, thanks. Suzune: You might have what it takes to run your own restaurant in the future. You know, once you settle down and get married or whatever. Kousei: Err... Nozomi: Kousei-kuuun! I need a carbonara and an omelet rice, okaaay? (wink) Kousei: Hey, come on. We're married now. Why are you still calling me \"Kousei-kun\"? Nozomi: Aww, you don't like it? Well, how about this: Nozomi: D-a-r-l-i-n-g! Kousei: Hehe. You're so cute, my sweet honeypoo! Nozomi: Geez, there are customers around! Stop embarrassing me! But I still love you! Kousei: Me too! Ahh, having a newly-wed waitress is the best! Nozomi: Hellooo, Kousei-kun? Nozomi: Earth to Kousei-kun! Hey! Kousei: Ouch! Huh?! What am I doing here? Kousei: My bad. I must've been daydreaming... Nozomi: There's no time for that. Hurry up and get back to making those crepes! Nozomi: There's still a ton of people waiting in line. Kousei: Sorry. I'll get right to it. Nozomi: You better. Kousei: Sorry. I'll try to focus. "

I shall leave that matter completely up to you. Kousei: Alright. I'll try preparing a few more dishes next week as an experiment. Maybe up the order limit to twenty-five. Kanna: Sounds good. Anyway, I'm sure you can guess why I've asked you two to stay behind. Mei: This is about my eye again, isn't it? Kanna: We just want to know how things are progressing, so this shouldn't take too much of your time. Has anything changed with your eye since we last spoke? Mei: No. I still don't know how to release my butterflies... Kanna: Not to worry. I'm certain you'll get there eventually. Mikado: Our main purpose in opening this cafe has always been to collect butterflies. Thanks to you, that task has been proceeding expeditiously. Mikado: Allow me to thank you for your hard work once again. We owe you our gratitude. Mei: A-All I'm doing is catching butterflies. I'd wouldn't exactly call that \"hard work\"... Mei: B-But either way, I'll continue to do my best to help! Mikado: Thank you. We appreciate it. Mei: ...... Mikado: But while I appreciate your efforts, I will not be transforming into a cat. Mei: Okay. I'm sorry. Kanna: Allow me to thank you as well, Takamine-san. Kousei: Huh? Why me? Kanna: While it was mere coincidence that brought you here to work with us, you've become an invaluable member of our team. Kanna: Many of our customers even come to our cafe specifically to eat your dishes now. Kanna: So thank you very much. You've been an incredible help to us all. Kousei: Well, I mean... this was all because of that \"problem\" I had with my soul in the first place... Kousei: But I'm glad you appreciate me. Honestly, this job has been pretty fulfilling for me too lately. Mikado: Indeed. It would appear your soul's condition has been greatly improving. Kanna: You can't let your guard down just yet, but as long as you keep heading in the right direction, you won't have anything to worry about. Kousei: Phew. That's a relief to hear. I owe it all to Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Huh? Kousei: Thanks for guiding me in the right direction. Mei: N-No, I didn't do anything. Kousei: You did. Thank you for everything. Mei: I-I... Mei: ...... Mei: U-Um, was there anything else you wanted to discuss? Kanna: No, I believe that's it. Mei: In that case, I've got something I need to do, so--! Mikado: Alright. Then we apologize for keeping you. Mei: That's okay! Anyway, I'll be going now! Kousei: Let me walk you-- Mei: Good night! Kousei: Huh? Kousei: Y-Yeah, I am... Kanna: Good night. Kousei: Yeah. Good night... Kousei: ...... Kousei: I should've known... Mei: Y-You're fine. Kousei: Freaking out? Mei: Y-Yeah... I... Um... Mei: ...... Mei: Oh, gosh... I'm so nervous... Mei: U-Umm... I think it would take too long to explain myself, so... h-here! Mei: Yes. It's... my Valentine's Day gift... to you. Kousei: Chocolate! Mei: Y-Yes. It's chocolate, and it's, um... handmade. Kousei: Handmade! Mei: Wow, you're really excited about this... Suzune-san taught me how to make it, so it should taste alright... I think. Kousei: Oh... Is that why you've been going home together lately? Mei: Yeah. I've been going to her apartment so she could teach me. Mei: She's also been helping me by asking you about your preferences and stuff... Kousei: My preferences? Oh, wait. Mei: Ahaha... Sorry. I guess I just felt kind of embarrassed... Kousei: Is that why the others said they weren't giving me any chocolate this year? So this would be a surprise? Mei: What? I don't know anything about that... Mei: But the others knew I was planning on giving you my own chocolate, so... I guess that could be why they did that... Kousei: Phew. I thought for sure you hated me or something... Mei: Wh-What?! Of course not! Why would you think that? Kousei: I mean, you've been avoiding me lately, haven't you? Mei: I-I wasn't... I mean... Well, maybe a little... Kousei: See? Mei: That's only because I didn't want you to find out I was preparing chocolate for you... Mei: But... I'm sorry for acting so weird. I didn't mean to give you the wrong idea. Kousei: It's alright. I've been really anxious these past few days, so it's a relief to know the truth. Mei: Urk... I'm sorry... Kousei: Handmade chocolate, though... This is more than I expected. Thank you. Mei: Um, if you'd like... you're welcome to go ahead and eat it... Kousei: Right now? Mei: Yeah. I actually brought you a fork too. Kousei: To be honest, I was planning to go home and savor it there... Mei: N-No, please! You can't! You can't keep me waiting that long! Mei: My heart's already pounding so fast it's about to explode! Mei: I need to know how you think it tastes right now... or else I'm going to die! Kousei: A-Alright. I'll have a bite... Mei: Please do! There are two inside, so at least try one of them! Right now! Mei: Something like that. It's called a chocolate fondant. Kousei: Sounds fancy. Was it hard to make? Mei: Not at all. Suzune-san was there to guide me through every single step. Mei: Ah, but just for the record--I made this all by myself! And I think I did a pretty good job! Mei: Though, um... it was a lot crispier on the outside when it came out of the oven, but it might be a bit soggy by now. Mei: But it shouldn't taste bad! This was Suzune-san's own personal recipe! I baked it with the utmost care! Mei: The flavor should be to your liking as well! So p-please, go ahead and try some! Kousei: Alright... don't mind if I do then. Mei: H-Help yourself! Kousei: ...... Mei: H-Hello? Kousei: ...... Mei: Senpai? Kousei: ...... Mei: Um... Does it... taste bad? Kousei: It's delicious. Mei: R-Really? Oh, thank goodness! Kousei: Oh god... It's so delicious... Mei: Wait, what? Huh? Kousei: How? How can something taste THIS good?! Mei: O-Oh, come on... You're exaggerating... Kousei: *sniffle*... Mei: Wait, are you crying? You're not pretending, are you? No way. Like, seriously? You're seriously crying? Kousei: I can't help it... Mei: O-Okay? Kousei: Everyone kept saying they wouldn't be giving me any chocolate... Mei: Oh... right. They said it'd be a hassle to get return gifts for everyone. Kousei: Even Nozomi, who usually gives me chocolates every year... gave me nothing. Mei: Wait, every year? Oh, right. You and Nozomi-chan are childhood friends. Kousei: Yeah, but she said she'd only been giving them to me out of force of habit... Mei: Oh... Err... I'm not sure what to say to that. Kousei: In the end, the only person who gave me chocolates was you... And handmade chocolate too... Kousei: Thank you... Thank you, Hiuchidani-san! Mei: I didn't think you'd be THIS emotional... but I'm glad you like it. Mei: But I can't say I was expecting you to start crying... It's a little, um, creepy. Kousei: Yeah, I know. I guess I tried too hard to sell it. Mei: Ah! I KNEW you were pretending, you stinker! Mei: Do you really mean that? Kousei: Yeah. I mean it. Seriously. Kousei: I could finish off both these chocolates right here if I'm not careful. Mei: Phew... Kousei: There's no way you could've gone wrong with Suzune-san's recipe. Mei: Yeah, but still... Kousei: Besides, even if it DID taste bad, I'd never say it to your face. Mei: What? So it really DOES taste bad?! Kousei: No, no. It's delicious. Really. Mei: *sigh*... My heart's pounding so much. Like, I've been feeling so anxious lately. That's why I've been acting so weird... Mei: When I was making the chocolate by hand, I began to understand how you feel, Senpai. Mei: Making food for someone else to eat is incredibly stressful and nerve-wracking... Mei: But it's also really fun, trying to make something that the person will like. Mei: And when you do get that confirmation from them that they like it... Mei: It makes you happier than words can describe! Kousei: I already told you. Why don't you believe me? Mei: Because I'm worried! Kousei: Didn't you taste it yourself beforehand? Mei: Well, yeah. I tried one I made from the same batch, but still... Kousei: It was delicious, wasn't it? Mei: It was, but this one's gone all cold! It's not FRESH! Kousei: Even so, it tastes delicious. Mei: Really? Really, really? Kousei: If you're really that worried about the taste, why don't you try some yourself? Kousei: See? I told you. Mei: Phew... Wait. Ah... Ahh! Kousei: What? Mei: Th-Th-Th-That was... an i-i-indirect k-ki--! Kousei: Oh, right. Sorry. You're pretty sensitive about these sorts of things, aren't you? Mei: O-O-Oh, no! It doesn't bothe--well... i-it does, I guess... Kousei: My bad. I totally forgot. Mei: I-I mean... As long as it's you, I... Mei: ...... Mei: U-U-Umm! Kousei: Hm? Mei: Suzune-san told me something... Kousei: Yeah? Mei: She said that you'd be happy receiving any kind of chocolate for Valentine's Day... Kousei: It's true. I'm pretty thrilled right now. Thank you, seriously. Mei: You're welcome... But she also said that... if I gave you handmade chocolate... Mei: Then... Umm... Kousei: Hm? Mei: Then you'd... umm! Kousei: Yeah? Mei: You'd think that... it meant I had genuine feelings for you... Kousei: O-Oh, come on! I can't believe she told you that too! Mei: Y-Yes... That's what she said... Kousei: I, er, I mean... I was only half-joking when I said that... Mei: You were... joking? Kousei: Y-Yeah. I was just messing with her... Kousei: B-But don't worry! I'm not dumb enough to think you like me just because of a couple chocolates! Mei: ...... Mei: I wouldn't mind... if you thought I did... though. Kousei: O-Okay? Kousei: ...... Kousei: Wait, what?! Mei: ...... Kousei: ...... Kousei: ...... Mei: Um... Mei: ...... Mei: During our girls' night out the other day... everyone kept asking me about that time we went to the pool together... Mei: Eventually, the conversation turned to... whether or not I had f-feelings for you, Senpai... Mei: I said I didn't know... but everyone else said it was obvious that I did... Mei: I thought they might be right... but I've never had any sort of romantic experience before... so I wasn't sure. Mei: I can't say I really understand my own feelings... but at the very least, I do know that you're a very important person to me. Mei: That's... what I wanted to tell you today. Mei: But... Mei: ...... Mei: Just now, I realized that... I really do... love you, Senpai. Mei: I mean, love is supposed to make your heart pound, isn't it? But when I'm with you, it's almost the opposite... I feel so relaxed that I thought it couldn't be love. Mei: But right now... my heart is pounding like crazy. Even though all I'm doing is telling you how I feel... my chest feels like it's about to burst. Mei: When I made up my mind to give you these chocolates... and when I decided to ask Suzune-san to teach me how to make them... Mei: While I practiced... This morning... During work... And while I was sitting here waiting for you earlier too... Mei: My heart wouldn't stop pounding. Mei: You wouldn't believe how nervous I felt. Mei: The truth is... I've had feelings for you all this time. Mei: So it's time I worked up the courage to say it. Mei: I... I think I love you, Senpai. Mei: No, wait... That doesn't sound right... Mei: ...... Mei: Senpai... I love you. Mei: I love the way you thank me, even when I've barely done anything... Mei: I love the way you're so nice to me, and lend an ear to all my worries... Mei: And I love so many other things about you too. Mei: So please... Mei: ...... Mei: Please... go out with me. Mei: Please... take me as your girlfriend. Mei: I... want to be with you from now on, Senpai. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Right now... my heart's also hammering like crazy. Kousei: When I thought you were avoiding me... it made me feel so lonely and so worried. Kousei: I was afraid you didn't like me, and I became really depressed. Kousei: Especially when you ran off without giving me any chocolate. Kousei: But then--you messaged to ask if we could meet. My heart wouldn't stop pounding on the way here. Kousei: This whole day's been a roller coaster of emotions for me. Kousei: But if what I'm feeling is the same thing you are... then I'm in love too. Kousei: In love with you, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Ah... Urk... Kousei: I love you too, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: S-So... Kousei: I want you to go out with me. Mei: ...... Mei: Ahhh... Mei: I'm a total mess of emotions right now... Kousei: Me too... My face must be burning up right now. Mei: ...... Kousei: ...... Mei: ...... Kousei: Uh... if you don't mind... Mei: Huh? Kousei: Could I call you by your first name? It'd feel oddly formal... if I kept using your last name. Mei: Y-Yeah, I agree... Go ahead. You don't have to use an honorific either... if you don't want. Kousei: Oh... Mei: Yeah. You can just call me Mei. Kousei: M... M-M-M... Mei: You're stammering so much... Kousei: I-I can't help it. I've never called you this before... Mei: That's fine. I can be patient. Kousei: M-Mei... Mei: There you go. Ehehe... Kousei: What about you? Mei: Huh? Kousei: Will you start calling me by my name? Mei: Senpai? Kousei: That's not what it says on my birth certificate. Mei: Urk... Mei: ...... Mei: Kousei... san? Kousei: You can drop the honorific too. Mei: Well... I mean, I'm younger than you, so... Mei: But maybe I could call you Kou-kun instead-- Mei: No, wait. That's even more embarrassing. Kousei: Yeah... That's pretty embarrassing for me too. Mei: Well, for now... I'm only going to use your first name when we're alone together. Kousei: A-Alright. I guess we wouldn't want the others to tease us about it. Mei: E-Exactly. Kousei: ...... Mei: ...... Kousei: Y-Yeah. I mean, if that's okay with you... Mei: O-Of course it is! Mei: ...... Mei: Finally... I'm your girlfriend! , Kousei: Morning, everyone. Suzune: Hey. Kanna: Good morning, Takamine-san. Kousei: How are the Yule Logs coming along? Suzune: We're about 80\\% done, I think. Kousei: Is there anything I can help with? Suzune: Wanna start prepping the cheesecakes for me? You remember how to do it, don't you? Kousei: Yeah. Kanna: I'll help out as well. Just tell me what to do. Kousei: Aren't you helping with the Yule Logs, though? Kanna: We've already finished rolling them into log-shapes. All that's left is to add the external decorations, but only Suzune-san is skilled enough to do that. Suzune: I'll be fine. You can go ahead and help him. Kousei: Alright. Mei: Whoa! An actual Yule Log! It looks absolutely scrumptious! Nozomi: Are you finished making them? Suzune: For today, at least. Phew... My shoulders are killing me. Kanna: I'm not surprised. You had to put the finishing touches on all of them. Natsume: Well, they certainly turned out great. Thanks for all your hard work. Kousei: We're not very busy right now, so feel free to take a break if you want, Suzune-san. Suzune: Thanks. I'll take you up on that then. Kanna: Of course. Natsume: Now then, let's get these cakes boxed up. Nozomi & Mei: Okaaay! Mei: Welcome to Cafe Stella! Party of two? If you'd rather not wait, we do have a couple counter seats available right now. Would that be alright? Nozomi: Welcome to Cafe Stella! Ah, you placed an order for two Yule Logs under the name Ota? I'll have them ready for you in just a moment. Natsume: Two pancakes, a blend coffee, and a Guatemalan coffee? I'll have those right out to you. Natsume: Two coffees; house blend and Guatemalan, please. Mikado: Coming right up. Kanna: Oh, Natsume-san! I need to go fetch some more Yule Logs from the kitchen. Can you cover for me while I'm gone? Natsume: I'll go fetch them instead. I need to put in another order anyway. Kanna: Alright, that'd be great. Thank you. Kanna: I apologize for the delay, sir. We'll have them ready in just a minute, so please be patient. Natsume: Order coming in. Two plates of pancakes, please. Kousei: Got it. Suzune: How are the Yule Logs selling? Natsume: Fairly well. Most of the customers who've placed advance orders have arrived to pick them up too. Suzune: Phew. That's a relief... Kousei: Were you that worried? Suzune: Well, yeah. I don't know if they're pranks or what, but sometimes you'll get large orders and then the customer never comes to pick it up. Kousei: That kind of stuff actually happens? I've read stories online, but it's scary how easy it is for a single person to screw you over. Suzune: Fortunately, it doesn't look like that's the case this time. Suzune: Anyway, back to work. Pancakes, was it? Kousei: Yeah. I'll handle them. Suzune: You will? Well, okay. Natsume: I'd better get these Yule Logs delivered too. Suzune: I'll help you carry them. I want to see how our customers are doing anyway. Mei: Welcome to Cafe Stella! Miyama: Hello again. Mei: Oh? You're Yuina-chan's--ah, I beg your pardon. Hello there, Mister Miyama. Miyama: Oh, you don't need to be so formal. Miyama: Actually, I'm also here to pick up a cake that I ordered. Mei: A Yule Log, yes? Wait right here; I'll have it out to you in one moment. Suzune: Welcome. Miyama: Hello again. I just can't ignore your cakes, they're so good. Miyama: My daughter's been looking forward to this for a while too. She says no other cake shop will do. Suzune: I'm flattered. I sincerely hope it's to your liking. Miyama: Oh, no need to worry about that. I'm confident it will be every bit as delicious as all the others I've had before. I'm looking forward to it as well. Suzune: Thank you very much. Your praise means a lot to me. Miyama: Oh, and before I forget. Could I also get some shortcakes, fruit tarts... this cheesecake here... and some mousse cakes, as well? Miyama: Four of each. I'm planning to give them to a few acquaintances as gifts. I'd like more people to see how delicious your cakes are. Especially since it's Christmas Eve, you know. Suzune: Would you like us to include some sort of message? It wouldn't take much time to add a simple plaque to it. Miyama: Oh, no. They're just going to be small gifts for some of my coworkers. I have to get back there once I'm done here. Suzune: It seems like you'll have quite a lot to carry, though... Miyama: Maybe, but I'll manage somehow. The hospital is only a few minutes' walk from here. Suzune: Alright. Mei: Here you are, Mister Miyama. Suzune: Ah, Mei-san. He'd also like shortcakes, fruit tarts, cheesecakes, and champagne mousses. Four of each. Mei: O-Oh, sure! I'll add those to your order. Mei: Let's see... In that case, your total comes to 11,820 yen. Miyama: Alright. One second... Wait, where's my wallet? What? Miyama: Ahh, right. I put it in my bag earlier. Phew. There it is. Miyama: My apologies. Mei: No problem, sir. Now then, you paid with 12,000 yen, so your change comes to 180 yen. Here you are. Miyama: Thank you very much. Suzune: Since you've got quite a few cakes, we separated them into two boxes for you. Miyama: Thank you. Suzune: Thank you for coming, and have a good day. Mei: Come visit us again sometime! Mei: Is he going to be okay with all those cakes? He's not going to get sick, is he? Suzune: They're not all for him. He said he's giving them as gifts to some of his coworkers. Mei: Oh, that makes sense. I guess there's nothing to worry about then. Mei: Ah--welcome to Cafe Stella! Suzune: You know, honestly, it's a lot easier making cakes than dealing with customers. Kousei: How are things looking out there? Suzune: Excellent. Everyone seems as happy as a clam. Suzune: But more importantly, why don't you take a break soon? Things are starting to wind down now. Kousei: Alright. Just let me finish up with this and I will. Kousei: Phew... Mikado: Understood. In that case, we will hold on to it for the meantime. Kousei: Yeah. Mikado: Yes... Yes... Kousei: Is there some kind of problem? Nozomi: Apparently one of our customers forgot something at the cafe, so they called to make sure it's still here. Nozomi: Yeah. They left in a rush so they wouldn't be holding up any other customers. You know how busy the cafe is today, with everyone coming in to pick up their cakes. Mikado: I understand. We'll be waiting. Goodbye. Nozomi: Are they coming back to get it? Mikado: Yes. However, he says that he is rather busy at work at the moment, so he does not know when that will be. Kousei: Then should we keep the bag in the fridge in the meantime? Mikado: No need. I am told it merely contains a Christmas present for his daughter. Kousei: Oh. But if so, he'll need to come get it by tonight. Kousei: As a parent, he's got to be feeling pretty anxious. Nozomi: Probably, yeah. Mikado: Hmm. Would you be willing to deliver it to him for us, Takamine Kousei? Nozomi: Oh, you're right! We can just bring it to him instead! Kousei: I guess I don't mind. Does he live around here? Mikado: You remember the little girl named Miyama Yuina who came to order a cake for her father's birthday, don't you? Mikado: The customer who forgot this present is her father. Kousei: Ahh. So that means I'll be going to the Miwa General Hospital? Mikado: Indeed. It might ruin the surprise for little Yuina if you were to deliver to their house instead. Nozomi: That's probably why her dad wanted to come pick it up himself. Mikado: Yes. Kousei: But that's enough reminiscing. I have a job to do. Kousei: No, I'm looking for a Dr. Miyama. I'm here to return something he forgot. Female Nurse: Ahh. Yes, I've been told. Female Nurse: Please give me a moment. He said he'd like to thank you in person. Female Nurse: He says he'll be with you in a minute. Would you mind waiting? It won't be long. Kousei: Sure. Kousei: Huh? Oh, I'm sorry. I was spacing out a little. Miyama: That's quite alright. I'm the one who should be apologizing. Some father I am, forgetting my own daughter's Christmas present. Miyama: Thank you for returning it to me. I truly appreciate it. Kousei: It was no big deal. Kousei: Can I ask you a question, though? These drawings--they haven't always been here, have they? Miyama: Oh, have they not? They were here when I first started working here. ???: Oh? Dr. Miyama? What are you doing out here? , Mikado: The digital age truly is a wondrous thing! Nozomi: I could take over for you while you-- Kanna: Oh, no. We need you to keep selling those crepes, Nozomi-san. Kanna: A cute shrine maiden selling crepes is our main selling point, after all. Suzune: Yep. Don't you worry about Kousei; he just loooves wrapping crepes! It's the very reason he was born on this earth. Kousei: You couldn't give me a better backstory than that, Suzune-san? Suzune: Oh, hush. Keep wrapping! Wrap like your life depends on it! Kousei: It's time I showed you the true power of a crepe-wrapping king! Kousei: Aghhhhhhhhh! Kanna: Nihihi. It looks like seeing your face was all the motivation he needed. Nozomi: Huh?! O-Oh, stop it... Kanna: Aww! You make an even cuter shrine maiden when you're embarrassed! Nozomi: Come on, Kanna-san. Stop teasing me... Nozomi: Okay! Kanna: We'll get right on it. Kousei: Well, thanks. Suzune: You might have what it takes to run your own restaurant in the future. You know, once you settle down and get married or whatever. Kousei: Err... Nozomi: Kousei-kuuun! I need a carbonara and an omelet rice, okaaay? (wink) Kousei: Hey, come on. We're married now. Why are you still calling me \"Kousei-kun\"? Nozomi: Aww, you don't like it? Well, how about this: Nozomi: D-a-r-l-i-n-g! Kousei: Hehe. You're so cute, my sweet honeypoo! Nozomi: Geez, there are customers around! Stop embarrassing me! But I still love you! Kousei: Me too! Ahh, having a newly-wed waitress is the best! Nozomi: Hellooo, Kousei-kun? Nozomi: Earth to Kousei-kun! Hey! Kousei: Ouch! Huh?! What am I doing here? Kousei: My bad. I must've been daydreaming... Nozomi: There's no time for that. Hurry up and get back to making those crepes! Nozomi: There's still a ton of people waiting in line. Kousei: Sorry. I'll get right to it. Nozomi: You better. Kousei: Sorry. I'll try to focus. \n\nWhile these examples may provide some guidance, evaluate their relevance to the current conversation.

            "Mei: Our new cafe, Cafe Stella, will be opening soon! We hope to see you there! Nozomi: If you'd like, please help yourselves to one of our madeleines! Go ahead, they're free! Pedestrian A: Mhh, these are great! Kanna: Thank you very much! Once we open for business, we'll be selling a variety of other cakes and baked good as well, so come check us out, if you're interested! Pedestrian A: Hmm... Natsume: W-We hope to see you there! Pedestrian B: Huh? Oh, um, sure! Natsume: If you'd like, please try one of our free samples too! Pedestrian B: A-Alright... Kousei: Oh, hello. You're, er, that employee from Patisserie Sourian, right? Cake Store Worker: Yes. Cake Store Worker: Not at all. I didn't do anything, really. But, umm, I have to ask. Cake Store Worker: How is Shioyama-san doing? Kousei: She's doing just fine. In fact, she's already found a new job. Kousei: She's the one who baked that madeleine you have. Cake Store Worker: What? So she works at this cafe? Kousei: Yep. We're planning to open next week. Cake Store Worker: Really? I had no idea. Kousei: We'll have other freshly-baked sweets and pancakes on opening day, if you're interested. Cake Store Worker: I may just have to stop by then. But anyway, I'd better get going. Kousei: I hope to see you there next week. Cake Store Worker: Of course. Suzune: They should be cool enough now. Suzune: There we go. Phew, looking good. Very good. Here's your strawberry tartlet. What do you think? Suzune: For the last time... It doesn't LOOK delicious; it IS delicious. Mei: Well, I certainly bet it is, but since I haven't tasted it yet, I can't say for sure, can I? Mei: So having said that, let me have a teensy tiny little bite of-- Nozomi: Hands off, missy. You can have some AFTER we take some pictures. Don't forget; this is for our Instogram. Mei: Ahaha! Sorry! Kousei: Alright, let's do this. Nozomi: I guess they don't pay professional photographers for nothing. The pictures they use on restaurant menus usually look way more appetizing. Suzune: This photo, um, actually makes it looks rather UN-appetizing. Or is that just me? Kousei: No, you're definitely right. Not that I can really say anything, since I'm the one who took it. Kousei: I'll try taking a few more and see if we get a lucky shot. Mei: Wait, Senpai! I have a suggestion. Why don't we try switching locations? Kousei: What would that do? Mei: There's a special trick to taking delicious pictures of food, you see. Mei: Ah--not to say the tart doesn't look delicious as it is, of course. It most certainly does. Suzune: Good save. Mei: Phew... So, as I was saying, some girls in my class taught me this super cool trick when taking food pictures! Kousei: Okay. I'm listening. Mei: Allow me to explain! Mei: From what I'm told, you want to take pictures somewhere with a lot of light. Near a windowsill, for example. Kousei: Oh. Mei: Next, you remove any unnecessary objects. Hands, flowers, whatever--get 'em all out of the shot. Mei: The object should be photographed close up, at an angle. Also, it shouldn't necessarily be dead-center in the image, but a little off to the side. Kousei: Interesting. Nozomi: I tried asking around too, and apparently there are a ton of easy-to-use apps that allow you to enhance photos. Mei: Oh, right! My friends also recommended me some photo-editing apps we could use. Nozomi: The girls in your class are pretty knowledgeable about this stuff, huh? Mei: They all love taking selfies. Mei: Both the really girly girls like you, Nozomi-chan, and even girls that act like sleazy old men. And especially the ones addicted to Instogram. Kousei: Well, either way, I'm glad we have you, Hiuchidani-san. Kousei: Without your guidance, we'd be stuck with these crappy pictures I took. Mei: Well, don't thank me just yet... Ka-chik. Mei: How's that look? Suzune: That's amazing. Just look at how shiny the glaze is. Nozomi: Oh my gosh! Nozomi: Kousei-kun's picture actually looks kind of gross when compared to this. Kousei: I'd have to agree. Mei: I can't believe it either. This turned out way better than I thought it would. Mei: I'll send this pic to my friends and ask them what they think. Kousei: Good idea. Let us know what they say. Mei: Aye, aye. Nozomi: How many followers do we have on Instogram right now, by the way? Mei: Barely any. But, I mean, we've only posted a couple basic announcements. Kousei: Still, it's above zero, isn't it? Nozomi: Yeah. As long as we have some, then we know our flyers worked to some extent. Kousei: I wonder if there's anything we can do to get more followers? Mei: There's no special trick, really. You just gotta put in the effort. Mei: Which means posting tons of pretty pictures, and including all the right hashtags so people can find them. Kousei: Ah, okay. Kousei: So you're saying we'll naturally gain more followers if we keep posting more pics of the cakes Suzune-san bakes for us? Suzune: Don't pin this all on me. Our menu also includes pancakes, omelet rice, pasta, coffee, and tea too, in case you've forgotten. Suzune: In my opinion, we should start by photographing all the items on our menu. Mei: Oh, good idea. Let's do that first. Suzune: So make sure you cook up your best for us, okay? Kousei: I'll try. Nozomi: I know it's important to upload pictures of our food, but don't you think it'd feel a little bland if that's ALL we post? Nozomi: Maybe we could post some casual photos every now and then? Or would that be unprofessional? Kousei: I don't think it's a bad idea. Kousei: Posting a variety of pictures might help us gain more followers. As long as we do it in moderation. Mei: Oh! My friends mentioned that too. Apparently, pictures of cats get a lot of impressions. Kousei: Hmm. Mei: Yeah, I suppose we can't just pick some stray cat off the street. Oh--one of my friends responded! Mei: \"Whoa! That looks delish! I'll definitely come order that once you guys open,\" she says! Mission success! Mei: Oh, there's more! \"Try angling it to the side a bit, and zooming in a little closer.\" Nozomi: Seriously? I thought we already had it pretty close. Mei: I guess we wanna eliminate as much of the unnecessary stuff in the background as possible. Hmm. Like this, maybe? Nozomi: Nice! That's gotta be perfect. Mei: Let's do one more. Suzune: Well, I'll leave you girls to it. Once you're done, feel free to eat the tart. Mei: You don't have to tell us twice! Suzune: You're coming with me, Kousei. We're making pancakes to take pictures of next. Kousei: Yes, ma'am! ",
            "Suzune: Crud. Looks like I'm all out of beer. Mei: Would you like some tea? I haven't drunk directly out of this one yet. Suzune: Sure. By the way, these kelp rolls are delicious. Mei: Hehe. I'll be sure to let my grandma know. Have as many as you want! Suzune: Hey, Kousei! Is it ready yet? I'm already getting full from all these kelp rolls! Kousei: Sorry for the wait. I just finished now. Mei: But you added some kind of smoked ingredient, didn't you? Kousei: You'll see. Go ahead and try it. Suzune: Uh-huh. Mei: ...... Suzune: ...... Mei: Oh? Suzune: Something tastes different. It's a lot more fragrant when I bite into it. Mei: It can't be the bacon, right? Where's this smoky flavor coming from? Suzune: It doesn't seem to be the vegetables, either... What exactly did you do? Kousei: It's the black pepper. That's what I smoked. Mei: Ohh! It's the seasoning! Kousei: Yeah. In a way, black pepper is actually the main ingredient in carbonara. That's where the name of the dish comes from, in fact. Suzune: It's derived from the Italian word for charcoal burner, right? Because there's supposed to be so much pepper on it that it turns black. Kousei: Exactly. I was contemplating whether or not to smoke the salt, but I thought that would change the flavor too much. Kousei: So I decided to smoke the pepper instead. This way it adds a nice kick without destroying the balance of the dish. Suzune: You're right. It really does add a nice kick. It's amazing how a small addition can make such a big difference. Suzune: Even though the seasoning is fundamentally the same, the flavor has a lot more depth. Mei: This is amazing! Just like authentic carbonara! Not that I know what authentic carbonara tastes like, but still! Kousei: Glad you like it. I only just finished smoking the pepper, so the smell might be a little harsh-- Kousei: But as long as I let it sit for a while, it should disappear. Then all I need to do is mix it with some regular black pepper to fine tune the flavor. Suzune: Sounds good. It could use a bit of adjusting, but I definitely think this is good enough to serve to our customers. In all honesty, this really is delicious. Kousei: Thanks. What about you-- Mei: Phew! That was good! Kousei: Wow. Not even a crumb left. Mei: It was too good! Just like real Italian cuisine! Not that I know what real Italian cuisine tastes like, but still! Suzune: You already said that earlier. I get what you're trying to say, though. Kousei: Ahaha... I wasn't expecting this much of a reaction. I'm flattered. Mei: Seriously, it was delicious! You're a genius, Senpai! Kousei: O-Oh stop it... Suzune: Well, since Mei-san is showering you in praise, I'm going to be a little more critical. Suzune: Like you said before, the dish still needs some balancing. Kousei: I know. It's got a pretty strong flavor, so I'm gonna try letting it mellow overnight next time. Suzune: Instead of trying to figure out everything on your own, though, you should ask the others at the cafe to taste-test your dish first. Suzune: Then you can decide if you want to tone it down, or if you actually want to emphasize that distinct flavor. Mei: Ohh, I see! The more unique it tastes, the more likely it is to grab people's interest! Suzune: Exactly. But you might get differing opinions on which one is better, which'll make it harder to decide. Suzune: Still, it's up to you. At the very least, I don't think anyone's going to object to you adding this dish to our menu. Kousei: Alright. I'll give it a shot. Kousei: And thanks, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Huh? Kousei: I wouldn't have come up with this idea without you, so thanks. Mei: Please! All I did was suggest the first thing that came to mind. Mei: Don't underestimate your own genius, Senpai! This really is amazing! Kousei: Th-Thanks. Suzune: Ahem. Kousei: Wh-What? Suzune: We're all out of cheese and sausages, so I'm gonna need you to make me some more. Kousei: You already ate them all? I wanted some too, you know. Suzune: Oh, stop griping. C'mon! Kousei: Alright, alright. Fine. Mei: Senpai! I want to try smoking some other things too! Kousei: Sure. I'll rummage around my fridge and see what else we can toss in the smoker. Mei: This is gonna be great! Kanna: Here's to another great year! Let's all do our best! Suzune: Alrighty. Ready to get back to work? Kousei: Yes, ma'am. Kousei: Not so much changed as added a new twist. I tried smoking the pepper first. Natsume: I can't say it looks or smells particularly different, though... Kousei: You'll see once you try it. Nozomi: Well, I'm gonna go ahead and dig in! Nozomi: That faint hint of smokiness... It's amazing how much difference it makes. Natsume: You said you smoked it yourself? Kousei: Yep. It was all Hiuchidani-san's idea. Mei: Don't be silly. You came up with the idea to smoke the black pepper. Mei: All I did was suggest that we try to make our own bacon. Natsume: Ah. So you spent the break thinking up ways to improve our menu... Natsume: That's very commendable of you. I'm impressed. Kousei: Thanks. How do you think it tastes? Kanna: I, for one, think it's delicious. It gives the dish a lot more added depth. Nozomi: I think so too. This seems like it'd be a real crowd-pleaser. Natsume: It certainly is delicious, but... Kousei: But? Natsume: I feel like the pepper's unique smokiness has a sort of... mature taste to it. Natsume: It's definitely not bad by any means, but--and this is just my personal opinion... Natsume: But I think I actually prefer the regular carbonara. Natsume: So while I'm all for adding this to our menu, I don't think it should replace the original version. Nozomi: You said you added the smoked black pepper to the pasta at the end, right? Kousei: Yeah, I did. Nozomi: In that case, why don't we just serve our regular carbonara with a shaker of smoked black pepper on the side? Nozomi: That way, customers can add as much or as little as they want. Natsume: How would we know how much to prepare in advance, though? Some customers might use a lot more than others. Suzune: A lot of beef bowl restaurants used to do the same thing with their special shichimi spices, but they had to stop the practice a little while back. Suzune: Some customers were using unbelievable amounts of spice, which ended up hurting their profits. Nozomi: Oh... I guess that won't work then. Kanna: It seems like our safest option would be to add this smoked pepper version as a separate item on the menu. Kousei: Alright. So I have all the judges' approval? Kanna: Absolutely. I think this would make a fine addition to our menu. Nozomi: Me too. Natsume: Me three. Kanna: What do you think, Mikado-san? Mikado: I believe Natsume mentioned earlier that this dish had a rather mature taste. However, many of our customers also come here specifically for our coffee and tea. Mikado: Judging from what I have gathered, this would suit their preferences well. Mikado: Therefore, I am in agreement. Kousei: Thank goodness... Mei: Way to go, Senpai! Kousei: Thanks! Kousei: I was just gonna do it at home, actually... Mikado: Among other problems, that would be quite expensive. I would not recommend you do that. Kousei: I guess that's true. Mikado: I do have some other ideas you may wish to consider. Are you free to talk after this? Kousei: Sure. I've got time. Kanna: In that case, let's call it a day here. See you tomorrow, everyone. Natsume: See you tomorrow. Nozomi: See you tomorrow! Kousei: Phew... Kousei: Huh? Hiuchidani-san? Mei: Hey. Kousei: What are you still doing here? Mei: I was waiting for you to finish. Kousei: You could've waited inside. Mei: Ahaha. I didn't want to bother you guys. Mei: Anyway, I know I should've said something earlier... but would you mind walking me home? Kousei: Sure. I don't mind. Let's go. Mei: Thanks! Mei: Congratulations on getting your new recipe approved, by the way. Kousei: Well, you helped with that. Mei: Not at all. You did this on your own, Senpai. Kousei: Nah, it's all thanks to you. I would've never come up with this idea on my own. Kousei: Seriously, thank you. I'm really grateful. Kousei: This might sound kind of melodramatic... but I think I've gained a little more confidence in myself now. Mei: Ehehe... You're gonna make me blush. I don't mean to sound melodramatic either, but, like... Mei: You've done a lot for me as well, Senpai. Ever since you've helped me open up about my left eye, I feel like a huge weight's been lifted off my shoulders. Mei: That's why I wanted to be able to return the favor if I could. Mei: I'm glad I managed to be of some small help to you. Kousei: It wasn't small at all. You were a big help. Kousei: I was hoping to do something like this before I had to deal with my exams, so I'm glad it all went so well. Mei: Oh, your exams are coming up? Kousei: At the end of the month, yeah. Mei: Does that mean you're gonna be working fewer hours? Kousei: No, I'll be working the same as usual. I'll do fine as long as I pay attention in class. Kousei: And I can always study after work too. Mei: You're a pretty diligent student, aren't you? Kousei: I don't know about that... I'm just the sort of guy who hates procrastinating. Mei: That's what it means to be diligent, Senpai. I think that's something to be proud of. Kousei: Nah, trust me... I can be pretty lazy when I want. Mei: But in front of me, at least, you're always hardworking and dependable. Kousei: Okay, sheesh. Stop flattering me. It's gonna go to my head. Mei: Ahaha! Alright. Mei: Well, good night, Senpai. Kousei: Good night. And sorry you had to wait for me earlier. Mei: That's okay. I waited because I wanted to congratulate you. Mei: Anyway, see you tomorrow! Kousei: Yeah. See you tomorrow. Mei: ...... Mei: Hmm... Exams... ",
            "Mei: Good morning! Natsume: Good morning. Kanna: Good morning. How was yesterday? Mei: I'm sorry? Natsume: She's talking about your date with Takamine-kun. Mei: My... WHAT? Kanna: You went somewhere together, didn't you? Mei: W-Well, yeah... Natsume: He didn't do anything stupid, did he? Kanna: We were worried that he'd get too carried away and blow his chance. Natsume: Yeah. He seems like the kind of guy to get way too worked up over a date. Mei: Wait, what? What? Suzune: Whoa there. Don't go having this conversation without me! Mei: Ah... Suzune-san. Good morning. Suzune: Good morning. So? You guys were talking about yesterday? Natsume: Yes. Suzune: How was it? How far did you two go? Mei: H-How far? Kanna: Jumping straight into it, are we? Suzune: I know you're just as curious as I am. I mean, they've basically seen each other naked now, no? Mei: WHAT?! Natsume: Wait, really? You've already done THAT? Mei: Oh, no! No, no, no! I mean--WHAT?! Suzune: Okay, maybe that was a bit misleading. I just meant they've seen each other in swimsuits. Mei: A bit?! That was EXTREMELY misleading! Kanna: Oh... so you went swimming? At a hot spring? Mei: We went swimming, yes, but at a pool... Natsume: Really? I didn't know they were already open at this time of year. Suzune: I think she means the big one nearby. It's a heated indoor swimming pool. Natsume: Oh, that sounds like a nice place to go to on a date. Mei: Actually, we went to the one by the station... Suzune: Wait, there's a pool by the station? When did they build that? Natsume: It must have a hot spring built in too. If it's by the station, I should go check it out myself sometime. Mei: Umm... No, it's not that sort of pool. It's a gym... Natsume: What? A gym? Mei: Yes. Like, a fitness center... Kanna: You went to a fitness center together? Mei: Yes... That is indeed where we went. Suzune: Oh. I thought for sure you went to a recreational pool to mess around and have fun. Mei: We just went to do some exercise. Separately... Kanna: Separately? Natsume: That... doesn't sound like much of a date. Suzune: More like a workout, than anything. Kanna: That's rather disappointing... Mei: Wh-What do you mean? It wasn't supposed to be a date! Suzune: Oh, come on. Don't be shy. Mei: I'm telling you, it wasn't a date! Suzune: Psh. That's lame. Mei: H-How? Natsume: A gym, huh? Well, I can certainly see that, coming from you. Mei: ...... Kanna: What's the matter? Mei: No, it's just... I feel a little dumb about the whole thing... Natsume: What for? Mei: The truth is, Senpai thought we were going to a recreational pool as well, but the idea hadn't crossed my mind at all... Suzune: Ahh. So Kousei was the only one who thought it was a date. Mei: N-No, I don't think that's the case... Mei: But still, he was absolutely right. We shouldn't have gone to a fitness center pool... Natsume: Oh, okay. So you wish you'd picked a better place for a date as well. Mei: F-For the last time, it wasn't a date! Kanna: Then allow me to be frank. How do you feel about him? Mei: Who? Kanna: Takamine-san, of course. Mei: Huh? Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What do you mean by that? Natsume: That reaction already says it all. Mei: N-No, I just, um... I have a lot of respect for him. Natsume: Respect? Mei: Y-Yes. Natsume: You... respect him? Kanna: Please don't look so bewildered. I feel bad for him now. Natsume: Sorry. Suzune: You respect him, nothing more? Mei: Huh? Well, um... I guess it's not only that... Mei: But... it's mostly respect... I think... Suzune: Hmm. Suzune: ...... Suzune: Nozomi-san's coming in today, isn't she? Kanna: Yes. Her shift starts at lunch. Suzune: Good. Are you all busy tonight? Natsume: Not particularly. Kanna: I don't have any plans either. Suzune: Well, if Nozomi-san's free as well, let's have a girls' night out! Suzune: Against the four of us, Mei-san doesn't stand a chance. Mei: Wait! What are you going to do to me?! Kanna: That's a great idea. Natsume: Sounds like fun. Mei: What? Huh? Why? Suzune: ...... Mei: Wh-What? Why are you grinning at me like that? Seriously, what? Suzune: Alright! Time to get to work, everybody! Kanna: Let's get down to it! Natsume: I'm looking forward to tonight. Mei: Wait, what? Hold up. Mei: Seriously? Kousei: See you guys later. Natsume: See you. Suzune: Where do you girls want to go? Should we find a restaurant somewhere? Kousei: Oh, are you all going out to eat? Kanna: We're having a girls' night out tonight. Nozomi: I can't wait. *giggle* Mei: ...... Kousei: Is it just me, or is Hiuchidani-san the only one not very excited about it? Natsume: Don't be silly. She's totally excited. Right? Mei: Yes. I am very excited. Kousei: Huh. Could've fooled me. Suzune: Actually, why don't we just go to my place? We'll have a hard time finding any places open this late. Natsume: True. We can just stop by a convenience store on the way and buy something there. Suzune: Alright. Let's get going. Suzune: Oh, and no boys allowed, so go kill some time before you follow us home, Kousei. Kousei: Huh? But if we're all going to the same apartment complex, why can't I just-- Suzune: No can do. Our girls' night out is already underway. Kousei: Fine. Suzune: Come on, girls. Let's go. Nozomi: Okaay. Mei: ...... Kousei: You alright, Hiuchidani-san? Mei: ...... Kousei: I'm gonna take that as a \"no.\" Suzune: Come on, Mei-san. Mei: Okay... Kousei: ...... Kousei: Weird. Suzune: Anyone want a beer? Natsume: I'm fine. Kanna: No, thank you. Suzune: Oh, well. More for me. Nozomi: Uh, so I forgot to ask, but why exactly are we having a girls' night out anyway? Suzune: So we can interrogate Mei-san about her relationship with Kousei. Nozomi: Her relationship with Kousei-kun? Mei: I wanna go home. Suzune: Aww, c'mon. We won't ask you anything too invasive. Just play along with us for tonight. Mei: *sigh*... What do you want to know? Kanna: In all honesty, how do you feel about Takamine-san? Mei: Cutting right to the chase, huh. I already answered that this morning, didn't I? Kanna: You said you respected him, but is that really all there is to it? Mei: I mean... Nozomi: Did something happen between them? Natsume: They went out somewhere together yesterday. Nozomi: Oh, phew. That's not bad... Suzune: What do you mean? Nozomi: I was afraid they'd gotten into a fight or something. Suzune: Oh, no. Just the opposite. They've actually been getting quite chummy lately. Nozomi: Oh, really? Natsume: How do you feel about all this, Sumizome-san? You're his childhood friend. Nozomi: He's never really been popular with girls, so honestly... I think it's great! It feels like my little Kousei-kun is finally growing up! Kanna: It almost sounds like you're talking about him as a brother. Nozomi: Well, we have known each other for a long time. That's just what happens. Kanna: There's your answer. Mei: What? Seriously, what? How do you want me to respond to that? Suzune: Let me be serious with you for a moment. Mei: Um, okay. Suzune: Whenever you have men and women working in the same place, it often presents a unique problem. Mei: Okay? Suzune: See, it's fine if they get along well, but if things turn sour, that can affect the atmosphere of the entire workplace, reducing productivity. Suzune: In order to avoid such things, it's therefore important for me to have a clear understanding of my coworkers' interpersonal relationships. Mei: Oh. I think I get that... Mei: ...... Mei: Did you really need to invite everyone else here for that, though? Suzune: Nope. Mei: What? Suzune: I just thought it'd be funner with more people. Mei: Seriously? Suzune: I won't deny that I'm doing this for amusement, but I also want to support you. Suzune: All you guys feel that way too, right? Natsume: Well, half that, and half out of curiosity. Kanna: I came 100\\% out of curiosity. Nozomi: In that case, I came 100\\% to support you! Suzune: See? Mei: Oh, uh... Thanks? Natsume: To be honest, like Suzune-san said, I want to know how things are going between you two as well--even though it's not really any of my business. Natsume: The cafe is just a really important place to me, so I'd hate for there to be any problems caused by interpersonal relationships. Natsume: Maybe I'm just a cynic, but I feel like it's all too easy for office romances to lead to those sorts of conflicts. Mei: Romance? Umm... I had a feeling that's where this was going, but, like... Natsume: Am I wrong? Mei: I don't think things between me and him are... like that. Kanna: You don't sound very confident. Mei: I mean, I don't have any experience with relationships, so I don't really know... Suzune: It definitely seems like you've got chemistry, though. From what I've seen, at least. Mei: Chemistry? Kanna: I agree. You become much more animated when you're talking with Takamine-san compared to when you talk with us. Mei: I-Is that true? I've never realized that myself... Natsume: I'd go so far as to say your eyes start to sparkle... maybe? Well, you get the idea. Suzune: You always go \"Senpai, Senpai!\" in such a cheerful voice. Whenever you're with Kousei, you seem even more upbeat than usual. Mei: What? Seriously? Natsume: What do you think, Sumizome-san? Have you noticed any recent changes in Takamine-kun's behavior? Nozomi: Hmm... I don't know. They definitely get along well, that's for sure. Nozomi: Ah--but I guess he seems a lot more... relaxed whenever he's around Mei-chan. Compared to Natsume-san and Kanna-san, for example. Natsume: True. He won't even sit beside me in class. Nozomi: Not a surprise. He's not really used to dealing with girls. Nozomi: But when he's with Mei-chan, I feel like he's more comfortable acting natural. Natsume: Hmm. I guess part of it might have to do with her being younger. Suzune: Not all the time, though. Yesterday he was all restless and fidgety. Mei: What? He was? Suzune: Yep. He was having a bit of trouble concentrating on work. Suzune: It made me smile, but he also kind of needed to get his act together. Suzune: So in all seriousness, the sooner you two sort out your feelings, the happier I'll be. Mei: Urk... Easier said than done... Kanna: It's almost Valentine's Day too. The timing couldn't be better. Nozomi: Oh, Valentine's Day! Are we doing anything special at the cafe? Natsume: Hopefully. Suzune-san and I are still figuring out what, though. Suzune: We'll probably do another limited-time special like we did on Christmas. I doubt it'll be as hectic this time around, though. Nozomi: True. People don't usually buy their Valentine's chocolates from cake shops. Suzune: If only chocolate had a longer shelf life. But yeah, that's why it's just going to be a limited-time thing, for girls to buy for their acquaintances and such. Suzune: You know, friend-chocolate. Kanna: Oh, that's right! I nearly forgot to ask. What should we do about OUR chocolates? Natsume: You mean for Takamine-kun? Kanna: Yes. And Mikado-san too. I wasn't sure if we should give our male coworkers chocolates. Nozomi: Why don't we give them one big gift, from all of us? That way it'll be easier for them to prepare a return gift too, as opposed to having to buy a gift for each of us individually. Natsume: Good idea. He'd probably be disappointed if we didn't get him anything. Suzune: In that case, Mei-san can get him something a little more personal. Mei: Gosh, why do we keep going here? Suzune: Well, it's either that or you pitch in with the rest of us. Which do you want? Mei: Well... I mean... Urk... Suzune: See? You don't want to, do you? Mei: Well, I mean... he does a lot for me, so, like... Mei: If I'm going to give him something... I want it to be from ME. Natsume: That's the only reason? Mei: Urk... Kanna: Oh? You're not denying it. Mei: I don't know what you want me to say... Mei: Ngh! Mei: I really don't know. I mean, I do l-like him, of course... Mei: But I just like him as a person... I don't know if that means I l-love him or not. Suzune: Ahhh! So adorbs! My heart can't take it! Natsume: God, what's gotten into you? Are you drunk? Suzune: A little. Kanna: Let me ask you this then. If Takamine-san started getting chummy with another girl, how would that make you feel? Mei: Hmm... Natsume: Out of all of us, I'd say he's closest to Sumizome-san, right? Nozomi: I guess, considering how long we've known each other. Suzune: Do you ever feel like there's a side of him only you know about? Nozomi: Something only I know? Let me think... Nozomi: His face when he wakes up, I guess? Kanna: You're not talking about what I think you are, are you? Nozomi: No, not like that. He gets up early by himself now, but I used to have to come over every morning to wake him up. Suzune: Ahh. I have a younger brother too, so I know what that's like. He'd always whine and yell when I yanked off his covers. Nozomi: Yeah... I once made the mistake of doing that too... Natsume: Why was it a mistake? Nozomi: You know how in the morning, guys get... um, you know... Suzune: Morning wood? Nozomi: Oh my god! You just outright said it! Mei: Morning what? Suzune: It's when guys get an uncontrollable erection in the morning. Mei: ...... Mei: Ahh! Suzune: Gee, what an adorable reaction. Nozomi-san, on the other hand, seems like she's pretty used to it. Nozomi: I wouldn't really say that. I've just happened to see it a few times, is all... Suzune: Oh-ho. So you've seen his erect ding-a-ling \"a few times,\" have you now? Natsume: His what? Kanna: She's definitely drunk, alright. Nozomi: I-It wasn't on purpose or anything, okay? It just happened on rare occasions when I came to wake him up... Suzune: Well, how does it feel knowing another woman's seen his, um... his wing-dang-doodle, Mei-san? Natsume: Excuse me? Kanna: You're a terrible drunk, Suzune-san. Suzune: Go ahead and tell us. Another woman's seen his private parts. How does that make you feel? Mei: Urk... Mei: Ngh... Mei: Nghhh! Mei: ...... Mei: It makes me feel... a little put out... I guess. Suzune: So you do have some feelings for him, deep down. Mei: Urk... I don't know... Suzune: Well, if you're planning to make him some homemade chocolate, let me know. I'll teach you everything you need to know. Mei: Homemade? But that'd totally make it seem like I... you know. Natsume: Like you're confessing to him, right. Mei: He might think I'm being too clingy, though... Nozomi: I don't know about that. I think he'd be thrilled. Suzune: So what do you say? Wanna make some homemade chocolate? Mei: Homemade chocolate... to confess my feelings... Homemade chocolate... Mei: Urk... Nghhhh! Mei: Ngh. Nozomi: M-Mei-chan? Natsume: She collapsed. Kanna: Her face is red as a beet too. Mei: I can't think straight anymore... My head's about to explode... Suzune: Aww, look at her. Acting all flustered like a young girl in love. Natsume: I feel like it's mostly your fault she's like this. Suzune: Sorry, she's just too cute. I can't help but tease her. Mei: Please, just let me go home already... I'm really not good with these sorts of conversations... Kanna: I know I said I only came because I was curious, but if you really are planning to confess to Takamine-san, I'll be glad to assist in any way I can. Kanna: I'd love for you two to be happily together. Nozomi: Me too! Let me know if there's anything I can do. Natsume: Alright. I think it's time we put this conversation to rest. It doesn't look like Hiuchidani-san can take much more. Mei: I can't... I'm about to die from embarrassment... Suzune: Man, what I wouldn't give to be young again... Kanna: What are you talking about? You're still plenty young. Suzune: There's a world of difference between being a student and being a working adult. Suzune: Time'll pass by before you know it, Mei-san. Make sure you don't leave any regrets behind. Mei: Urk... Alright. I'll try to think about how I really feel... Suzune: Honestly, though, it's already pretty clear to the rest of us. Kanna: That's just how love works. The person themselves can oftentimes be oblivious to the fact. Natsume: Very true. Nozomi: You three talk like you know a lot. You must have a ton of dating experience, huh? All Three: ...... Nozomi: Why did you all look away? Do you... not? Natsume: Anyway, why don't we start discussing our Valentine's Day menu? Suzune: Sounds like a great idea! Kanna: Indeed! Nozomi: Oops... I guess I shouldn't have asked. Mei: Urk... Mei: Do I really like him... that way? Mei: ...... Mei: Urk... I don't know! Ngh! Mei: G-Good morning! Kousei: What did you do to her yesterday? Suzune: Nothing. We just had a little chat. Kousei: ...... Suzune: Why are you giving me that look? Kousei: Because she's clearly acting weird. Suzune: Well, it's obvious why... Suzune: ...... Kousei: What do you mean? Suzune: Well, maybe I do owe her an apology. Kousei: What? Suzune: I might've teased her a little too much. Kousei: Huh? Suzune: Well, thankfully, we might see some progress now. Kousei: What progress? Suzune: You'll see soon enough. And you'd better thank me when it happens. Kousei: When what happens? Suzune: Uh-oh. Our orders are starting to pile up. Better get back to work. Kanna: Actually, Takamine-san, could I ask you and Mei-san to stay behind for a little while? Mei: Huh? Suzune: Hold on. What are you doing? Kanna: This doesn't have anything to do with what we discussed yesterday. I just need to talk to them about their shifts. Suzune: Oh, okay. Suzune: Well, see you all tomorrow! Natsume: Bye, everyone. Kanna: No, of course not. Kousei: I thought so. This is about Hiuchidani-san's eye, isn't it? Mikado: Yes, indeed. Mei: I forgot to ask before, but does anyone at the cafe else know about my eye? Mikado: Natsume knows. Suzune and Nozomi do not, however. Mei: Natsume-san san knows too? That's a relief. Kanna: Still, I must advise you not to speak with her about it too carelessly. We wouldn't want anyone overhearing you by accident. Mei: Alright. Mikado: How are things going with your eye? Mei: Nothing much has changed. Mikado: Which means you haven't found a way to release your butterflies yet? Mei: Err... No, not yet. Kanna: We haven't had many opportunities to practice, after all. Would you like to do some now? Mei: Sure. Mei: But that being said... Mikado: You said you are able to capture butterflies simply by staring at them, correct? Mei: Yeah. After I stare at them for a while, they just disappear. Kanna: In that case, perhaps you could do the opposite, and try staring at an empty space while imagining them appearing. Mei: Imagine them appearing? Mei: Nghhh... Mei: ...... Mei: It's not working. Kousei: What about other people who had the eye? How did they release their butterflies? Mikado: Well, if we knew that, we would not be having this problem. Kousei: Good point. But haven't any other Grim Reapers documented it? Kanna: We've tried searching for more information, but no such luck. Kanna: And to the best of my knowledge, Mei-san is the only person who possesses the eye yet can't see the butterflies. Kousei: So she's an anomaly? Mikado: We don't know that either. People who possess the eye are rare enough in and of themselves. There is simply not enough information. Mikado: That is precisely what makes her such an interesting case study. Kousei: You make her sound like some kind of guinea pig... Mei: That's okay. I want to find out everything I can about my eye as well. Mei: If anything, I should be the one apologizing for being so unhelpful... Kanna: If only I could use my scythe to retrieve the butterflies from your eye... Kousei: You can't? Kanna: I don't dare try. It could end up causing unforeseen damage to Mei-san's soul. Kanna: Perhaps if I knew exactly where the butterflies were located, I might be able to do something about it, but I don't. Mikado: We are no longer able to sense butterflies that have been captured by the eye. Mikado: That is why we did not realize that Mei possessed the eye in the first place. Kousei: Interesting. Kanna: I just had an idea, Mei-san. Mei: Yes? Kanna: Whenever you capture butterflies, is there anything in particular that you think of? Mei: Something I think of? Hmm... I'm not really sure... Kanna: So you do it without thinking? Mei: Well... I guess I think to myself, \"Go away!\" or something like that. Mei: But the very first time I ever noticed a wisp... Mei: ...... Mei: I was mostly just curious. \"What is that?\" I thought, and so I kept staring at it until it disappeared. Mei: That's what crossed my mind the first time it happened, at least. Kanna: Just curiosity... Kousei: So then if she does the opposite, and tries NOT to think about the butterflies, she'll be able to release them? Mikado: You realize that, until just recently, she had no idea that there were even butterflies inside her? Kousei: Oh, right. I guess she hasn't been thinking about them this whole time. I wonder what it is she needs then? Kanna: Maybe what she needs is... something more concrete. Mei: What do you mean? Kanna: If, by thinking about \"butterflies\", you are able to capture them... Kanna: Then perhaps by focusing your thoughts on a specific \"place\", you'll be able to release them. Mei: Oh. So instead of just vaguely trying to release them anywhere, I should try to think about releasing them towards someplace specific? Kanna: Why don't you give it a shot? Mei: Alrighty! Mei: Ngh... Mei: Nghh! Mei: C'mon, the chair... The chair! Mei: Nggghhhhh! Mikado: It doesn't seem to be working. Mei: I'm sorry... Kanna: Maybe you aren't focusing hard enough... or maybe I'm just completely wrong. Kanna: Hmm... Kanna: Your Excellency. Mikado: Yes? Kanna: Please turn into your cat form. Mikado: I beg your pardon? Kanna: Please turn into your cat form. Mikado: I refuse. Kanna: Please turn into your cat form. Mikado: You can repeat yourself however many times you wish, but no means no! Kanna: Please! I'm sure this will work! Remember that Mei-san has an abnormal fixation with cats. Mikado: I will not! Mei: A-Abnormal fixation? That's mean... Kousei: Well... she's not wrong. Mei: You too, Senpai?! Kousei: I mean... you turn pretty crazy whenever you see a cat. Kanna: To put it bluntly, you turn into a complete maniac. Mei: W-Wow! You're so mean! Kanna: We've got nothing to lose by trying. Please, Your Excellency! This is for Mei-san's sake! Mikado: Kgh... Very well. But you had best keep yourself under control this time, Mei. Mei: Don't worry! I will, I promise! Mikado: I do not believe you! Kanna: Please, Your Excellency. Hurry it up! Mikado: Fine... Have your wish! Mei: Ahhhhhhh! Mikado: Mei! Have you already forgotten your promise?! Mei: R-R-Relax! I-I'm fine! I-I'm completely calm! Kousei: That look in your eyes begs to differ... Kanna: This is just a guess... but Mei-san seems like the kind of person stray cats run from. Mei: How did you know? It's true; even cats that are used to people always run away from me! I wonder why? Mikado: Is it not painfully obvious? Kanna: Now then, Mei-san. Please try imagining your butterflies being released around His Excellency. Mei: R-Right! A-Around His Excellency! Y-Yes! O-Of course! Mikado: I do not wish to be rude, Mei, but I find your behavior most repulsive right now. Kousei: That's about as rude as it gets, though. Mei: I don't mind! He can call me repulsive as much as he wants! Kousei: You've got problems, Hiuchidani-san. Seriously. Mei: A-Anyway, here I go! Mikado: Very well. But you can do it standing from there. Do not come any closer, you hear? Mei: A-Alright! *pant*... *pant*... Mikado: ...... Mei: *pant*... *pant*! Mikado: Why are you breathing so heavily? Mei: *PANT*... *PANT*! Mikado: Enough! If this goes on any further, I will not be safe! Mei: *PAAAANT*! Kanna: Alright, Mei-san. Settle down, settle down. Mei: Huh? It's over? My time's up already? Wait! How much do I have to pay for an extension?! Mikado: What on earth is this child talking about? Kousei: Well, I guess that didn't work either. Kanna: My idea must've been wrong. I suppose we'll have to think this over some more. Mei: Five thousand yen! I'll pay five thousand yen! Mikado: That is quite enough. Playtime is over. Mei: Ahh... He's gone... Mikado: Good grief. I am beginning to suspect that this derangement of yours is a side effect of using your eye... Mei: What do you mean? I was totally calm and collected. Kousei: ...... Kanna: ...... Mikado: I believe you have something to say to me, Mei. Mei: Okay, fine! I'm sorry! Kanna: Anyway, why don't we stop here for today? Mikado: Before we do, though, I must ask. Have you captured any other butterflies lately besides the ones in the cafe? Mei: No. I haven't used my powers at all outside of the cafe. Mikado: Alright. Very well. Kanna: If that's all, then we'll see you-- Mei: Actually, can I ask one more thing? Mikado: Yes? Mei: Is it possible that using my eye... could have a negative effect on the person? Kanna: You mean when you use it to capture butterflies? Mei: Yeah. You said that it had the power to heal people's souls, but, um... how do I put this... Kousei: For example, if a person's soul was weakened because of a physical problem, healing their soul wouldn't resolve the underlying issue. Kousei: On the contrary, healing only their soul might have a negative effect on their body. Kousei: I think that's what Hiuchidani-san means to say. Mei: R-Right. That's it. Thank you. Mikado: Hmm... It is difficult to say for certain. Mei: In that case, isn't it kind of risky for me to be using my eye on our customers? Mikado: Perhaps. But it is also better than doing nothing. Mikado: There have been no instances of any customers returning to the cafe with new butterflies after you captured their old ones. Mikado: As of this moment, we have no reason to believe that the power of your eye has any negative effect on others. Mei: Oh... Kanna: Did something happen that caused you to think that it might? Mei: N-No, not exactly... Mei: ...... Mei: It's just... I feel like I've been getting a little carried away ever since I learned the truth about my eye, and learned that there were other people that understood me. Mei: If it turns out that my eye is causing others harm, though... I'd rather just stop using it altogether. Mikado: It is I who tasked you with capturing other people's butterflies. If there truly are any negative consequences of doing so, it would be my responsibility to bear. Mikado: So do not worry. Thanks to you, our job of collecting butterflies has been going remarkably smoothly. That is a fact. Mei: Okay. Thank you for saying that. Kanna: Are there any other questions you'd like to ask? Mei: No, that's all. Kanna: In that case, I'll see you both tomorrow. Good night. Mikado: Good night. Make sure you get plenty of rest. Mei: We will. Good night! Kousei: Good night. Kanna: ...... Mikado: Are you still worried? Kanna: I'm a little relieved, actually, knowing that Mei-san has her own reservations about using her eye. Mikado: I've never been worried about that myself. Despite appearances, she is a very rational-- Mikado: ...... Kanna: Struggling to finish that sentence, aren't you? Mikado: Allow me to rephrase. Although she tends to lose her head under certain circumstances, she is generally a very compassionate person. Mikado: She is the sort of person who would never even think about abusing the power of her eye. Kanna: I'm not worried about that either. I trust Mei-san completely. Kanna: What worries me is... something else. Mikado: We've already warned her many times not to let anyone realize the truth about her eye. Kanna: I know. Of course, times have changed now, but still... Mikado: People's hearts remain largely the same. Kanna: That's why I was against using her eye in the first place. Kanna: There may not be any problems right now, but if things start to fall apart, Mei-san will be the one to suffer. Kanna: And all the positive influence she's been having on Takamine-san's soul will be for naught. Kanna: If anything were to happen to Mei-san, Takamine-san would undoubtedly be greatly affected as well. Mikado: Hmm. So it is not Mei, but Takamine Kousei you are worried about? Kanna: I'm worried about them both. But... I realize I may just be feeling overprotective. Kanna: If you wish for her to have full control over the power of her eye, I won't object. Rest assured. Mikado: I understand that you are concerned, but we cannot allow these butterflies to simply remain inside of Mei either. Kanna: I know. Mikado: Incidentally, Kanna. Kanna: Yes? Mikado: What exactly was it that you and Mei spoke about yesterday? I understand you and the others had a \"girls' night out.\" Kanna: Tsk, tsk. How rude, Your Excellency. You mustn't ask a young lady to divulge her secrets. Mikado: Ah. So it was nothing of importance then. Kanna: Nihihi. Nope. Just a little gossip between girls, is all. Kanna: I do hope everything works out between those two, though... Mei: Oh... yeah. It's been weighing on my mind for a while now. Mei: The truth is, I've been getting a little carried away ever since His Excellency gave me this task. Mei: I'm worried that I've only been adding to people's troubles, like I did to her. Mei: I was starting to question whether capturing our customer's wisps was the right thing to do. Kousei: Hmm... It's hard to say. Mei: Yeah. It is. Kousei: But you know, I've been thinking as well. Kousei: I suggested that maybe this friend of yours had a physical problem, and that's why she still hasn't gotten better. Kousei: But after you'd cast your \"magic spell\" on her, you saw a significant improvement in her mood, didn't you? Mei: Yeah. While I wouldn't say she recovered completely, there was definitely a big improvement. Kousei: If that's true, then it must be some sort of emotional problem. That's why the power of your eye was able to cheer her up temporarily. Kousei: And in that case, there's no doubt in my mind that your \"magic spell\" provided her with some much-needed relief. Kousei: While it's unfortunate that she ended up becoming overly dependent on it, it's clear that the weight in your friend's heart was lightened because of you. Kousei: If I had to say whether it was the right or wrong decision, I'd have to say it was right. Kousei: So I don't think there's anything you should feel guilty or anxious about. Kousei: The power in your left eye is unmistakably a power that helps others. And I'm certain it'll help a lot more people from now on. Mei: ...... Kousei: Uh... sorry. Maybe it's not my place to say anything. Mei: N-No, don't apologize... Mei: ...... Mei: C-Can you read my mind, Senpai? Kousei: Huh? Mei: It makes me really happy... You always seem to know exactly what I want to hear. Mei: It almost feels like you know exactly what I'm thinking all the time. Kousei: Nah... I'm not that sensitive, to be honest. In fact, I can be downright insensitive sometimes. Kousei: But one thing I will say is that I'm not saying these things just to cheer you up. Kousei: I mean it. All of it. Kousei: The stuff about me being grateful to you, and the stuff about your eye--you, helping other people. Kousei: I mean all of it, from the bottom of my heart. Kousei: And if I managed to get that message across to you, well... then that'd make me happy too. Mei: ...... Kousei: Sorry if I seem like I'm trying too hard to be cool or something. I'm lame, I know. Mei: N-No! You're really not... Mei: ...... Mei: U-Umm! Kousei: Hm? Mei: Do you like sweets, Senpai? Kousei: Huh? What's this about? Mei: Do you? Kousei: Well, sure, I guess. Mei: Okay, great! Good night! Kousei: Huh? O-Oh. Yeah, g'night. Mei: Thanks for walking me home! See you tomorrow! Kousei: R-Right. See you tomorrow... Mei: ...... Mei: Hi, Suzune-san? It's me, Mei. I'm sorry for the random call... Mei: Um, I was wondering something... Mei: ...... Mei: C-Could you teach me how to make my own chocolate? "

Mei: So having said that, let me have a teensy tiny little bite of-- Nozomi: Hands off, missy. You can have some AFTER we take some pictures. Don't forget; this is for our Instogram. Mei: Ahaha! Sorry! Kousei: Alright, let's do this. Nozomi: I guess they don't pay professional photographers for nothing. The pictures they use on restaurant menus usually look way more appetizing. Suzune: This photo, um, actually makes it looks rather UN-appetizing. Or is that just me? Kousei: No, you're definitely right. Not that I can really say anything, since I'm the one who took it. Kousei: I'll try taking a few more and see if we get a lucky shot. Mei: Wait, Senpai! I have a suggestion. Why don't we try switching locations? Kousei: What would that do? Mei: There's a special trick to taking delicious pictures of food, you see. Mei: Ah--not to say the tart doesn't look delicious as it is, of course. It most certainly does. Suzune: Good save. Mei: Phew... So, as I was saying, some girls in my class taught me this super cool trick when taking food pictures! Kousei: Okay. I'm listening. Mei: Allow me to explain! Mei: From what I'm told, you want to take pictures somewhere with a lot of light. Near a windowsill, for example. Kousei: Oh. Mei: Next, you remove any unnecessary objects. Hands, flowers, whatever--get 'em all out of the shot. Mei: The object should be photographed close up, at an angle. Also, it shouldn't necessarily be dead-center in the image, but a little off to the side. Kousei: Interesting. Nozomi: I tried asking around too, and apparently there are a ton of easy-to-use apps that allow you to enhance photos. Mei: Oh, right! My friends also recommended me some photo-editing apps we could use. Nozomi: The girls in your class are pretty knowledgeable about this stuff, huh? Mei: They all love taking selfies. Mei: Both the really girly girls like you, Nozomi-chan, and even girls that act like sleazy old men. And especially the ones addicted to Instogram. Kousei: Well, either way, I'm glad we have you, Hiuchidani-san. Kousei: Without your guidance, we'd be stuck with these crappy pictures I took. Mei: Well, don't thank me just yet... Ka-chik. Mei: How's that look? Suzune: That's amazing. Just look at how shiny the glaze is. Nozomi: Oh my gosh! Nozomi: Kousei-kun's picture actually looks kind of gross when compared to this. Kousei: I'd have to agree. Mei: I can't believe it either. This turned out way better than I thought it would. Mei: I'll send this pic to my friends and ask them what they think. Kousei: Good idea. Let us know what they say. Mei: Aye, aye. Nozomi: How many followers do we have on Instogram right now, by the way? Mei: Barely any. But, I mean, we've only posted a couple basic announcements. Kousei: Still, it's above zero, isn't it? Nozomi: Yeah. As long as we have some, then we know our flyers worked to some extent. Kousei: I wonder if there's anything we can do to get more followers? Mei: There's no special trick, really. You just gotta put in the effort. Mei: Which means posting tons of pretty pictures, and including all the right hashtags so people can find them. Kousei: Ah, okay. Kousei: So you're saying we'll naturally gain more followers if we keep posting more pics of the cakes Suzune-san bakes for us? Suzune: Don't pin this all on me. Our menu also includes pancakes, omelet rice, pasta, coffee, and tea too, in case you've forgotten. Suzune: In my opinion, we should start by photographing all the items on our menu. Mei: Oh, good idea. Let's do that first. Suzune: So make sure you cook up your best for us, okay? Kousei: I'll try. Nozomi: I know it's important to upload pictures of our food, but don't you think it'd feel a little bland if that's ALL we post? Nozomi: Maybe we could post some casual photos every now and then? Or would that be unprofessional? Kousei: I don't think it's a bad idea. Kousei: Posting a variety of pictures might help us gain more followers. As long as we do it in moderation. Mei: Oh! My friends mentioned that too. Apparently, pictures of cats get a lot of impressions. Kousei: Hmm. Mei: Yeah, I suppose we can't just pick some stray cat off the street. Oh--one of my friends responded! Mei: \"Whoa! That looks delish! I'll definitely come order that once you guys open,\" she says! Mission success! Mei: Oh, there's more! \"Try angling it to the side a bit, and zooming in a little closer.\" Nozomi: Seriously? I thought we already had it pretty close. Mei: I guess we wanna eliminate as much of the unnecessary stuff in the background as possible. Hmm. Like this, maybe? Nozomi: Nice! That's gotta be perfect. Mei: Let's do one more. Suzune: Well, I'll leave you girls to it. Once you're done, feel free to eat the tart. Mei: You don't have to tell us twice! Suzune: You're coming with me, Kousei. We're making pancakes to take pictures of next. Kousei: Yes, ma'am! , Suzune: Crud. Looks like I'm all out of beer. Mei: Would you like some tea? I haven't drunk directly out of this one yet. Suzune: Sure. By the way, these kelp rolls are delicious. Mei: Hehe. I'll be sure to let my grandma know. Have as many as you want! Suzune: Hey, Kousei! Is it ready yet? I'm already getting full from all these kelp rolls! Kousei: Sorry for the wait. I just finished now. Mei: But you added some kind of smoked ingredient, didn't you? Kousei: You'll see. Go ahead and try it. Suzune: Uh-huh. Mei: ...... Suzune: ...... Mei: Oh? Suzune: Something tastes different. It's a lot more fragrant when I bite into it. Mei: It can't be the bacon, right? Where's this smoky flavor coming from? Suzune: It doesn't seem to be the vegetables, either... What exactly did you do? Kousei: It's the black pepper. That's what I smoked. Mei: Ohh! It's the seasoning! Kousei: Yeah. In a way, black pepper is actually the main ingredient in carbonara. That's where the name of the dish comes from, in fact. Suzune: It's derived from the Italian word for charcoal burner, right? Because there's supposed to be so much pepper on it that it turns black. Kousei: Exactly. I was contemplating whether or not to smoke the salt, but I thought that would change the flavor too much. Kousei: So I decided to smoke the pepper instead. This way it adds a nice kick without destroying the balance of the dish. Suzune: You're right. It really does add a nice kick. It's amazing how a small addition can make such a big difference. Suzune: Even though the seasoning is fundamentally the same, the flavor has a lot more depth. Mei: This is amazing! Just like authentic carbonara! Not that I know what authentic carbonara tastes like, but still! Kousei: Glad you like it. I only just finished smoking the pepper, so the smell might be a little harsh-- Kousei: But as long as I let it sit for a while, it should disappear. Then all I need to do is mix it with some regular black pepper to fine tune the flavor. Suzune: Sounds good. It could use a bit of adjusting, but I definitely think this is good enough to serve to our customers. In all honesty, this really is delicious. Kousei: Thanks. What about you-- Mei: Phew! That was good! Kousei: Wow. Not even a crumb left. Mei: It was too good! Just like real Italian cuisine! Not that I know what real Italian cuisine tastes like, but still! Suzune: You already said that earlier. I get what you're trying to say, though. Kousei: Ahaha... I wasn't expecting this much of a reaction. I'm flattered. Mei: Seriously, it was delicious! You're a genius, Senpai! Kousei: O-Oh stop it... Suzune: Well, since Mei-san is showering you in praise, I'm going to be a little more critical. Suzune: Like you said before, the dish still needs some balancing. Kousei: I know. It's got a pretty strong flavor, so I'm gonna try letting it mellow overnight next time. Suzune: Instead of trying to figure out everything on your own, though, you should ask the others at the cafe to taste-test your dish first. Suzune: Then you can decide if you want to tone it down, or if you actually want to emphasize that distinct flavor. Mei: Ohh, I see! The more unique it tastes, the more likely it is to grab people's interest! Suzune: Exactly. But you might get differing opinions on which one is better, which'll make it harder to decide. Suzune: Still, it's up to you. At the very least, I don't think anyone's going to object to you adding this dish to our menu. Kousei: Alright. I'll give it a shot. Kousei: And thanks, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Huh? Kousei: I wouldn't have come up with this idea without you, so thanks. Mei: Please! All I did was suggest the first thing that came to mind. Mei: Don't underestimate your own genius, Senpai! This really is amazing! Kousei: Th-Thanks. Suzune: Ahem. Kousei: Wh-What? Suzune: We're all out of cheese and sausages, so I'm gonna need you to make me some more. Kousei: You already ate them all? I wanted some too, you know. Suzune: Oh, stop griping. C'mon! Kousei: Alright, alright. Fine. Mei: Senpai! I want to try smoking some other things too! Kousei: Sure. I'll rummage around my fridge and see what else we can toss in the smoker. Mei: This is gonna be great! Kanna: Here's to another great year! Let's all do our best! Suzune: Alrighty. Ready to get back to work? Kousei: Yes, ma'am. Kousei: Not so much changed as added a new twist. I tried smoking the pepper first. Natsume: I can't say it looks or smells particularly different, though... Kousei: You'll see once you try it. Nozomi: Well, I'm gonna go ahead and dig in! Nozomi: That faint hint of smokiness... It's amazing how much difference it makes. Natsume: You said you smoked it yourself? Kousei: Yep. It was all Hiuchidani-san's idea. Mei: Don't be silly. You came up with the idea to smoke the black pepper. Mei: All I did was suggest that we try to make our own bacon. Natsume: Ah. So you spent the break thinking up ways to improve our menu... Natsume: That's very commendable of you. I'm impressed. Kousei: Thanks. How do you think it tastes? Kanna: I, for one, think it's delicious. It gives the dish a lot more added depth. Nozomi: I think so too. This seems like it'd be a real crowd-pleaser. Natsume: It certainly is delicious, but... Kousei: But? Natsume: I feel like the pepper's unique smokiness has a sort of... mature taste to it. Natsume: It's definitely not bad by any means, but--and this is just my personal opinion... Natsume: But I think I actually prefer the regular carbonara. Natsume: So while I'm all for adding this to our menu, I don't think it should replace the original version. Nozomi: You said you added the smoked black pepper to the pasta at the end, right? Kousei: Yeah, I did. Nozomi: In that case, why don't we just serve our regular carbonara with a shaker of smoked black pepper on the side? Nozomi: That way, customers can add as much or as little as they want. Natsume: How would we know how much to prepare in advance, though? Some customers might use a lot more than others. Suzune: A lot of beef bowl restaurants used to do the same thing with their special shichimi spices, but they had to stop the practice a little while back. Suzune: Some customers were using unbelievable amounts of spice, which ended up hurting their profits. Nozomi: Oh... I guess that won't work then. Kanna: It seems like our safest option would be to add this smoked pepper version as a separate item on the menu. Kousei: Alright. So I have all the judges' approval? Kanna: Absolutely. I think this would make a fine addition to our menu. Nozomi: Me too. Natsume: Me three. Kanna: What do you think, Mikado-san? Mikado: I believe Natsume mentioned earlier that this dish had a rather mature taste. However, many of our customers also come here specifically for our coffee and tea. Mikado: Judging from what I have gathered, this would suit their preferences well. Mikado: Therefore, I am in agreement. Kousei: Thank goodness... Mei: Way to go, Senpai! Kousei: Thanks! Kousei: I was just gonna do it at home, actually... Mikado: Among other problems, that would be quite expensive. I would not recommend you do that. Kousei: I guess that's true. Mikado: I do have some other ideas you may wish to consider. Are you free to talk after this? Kousei: Sure. I've got time. Kanna: In that case, let's call it a day here. See you tomorrow, everyone. Natsume: See you tomorrow. Nozomi: See you tomorrow! Kousei: Phew... Kousei: Huh? Hiuchidani-san? Mei: Hey. Kousei: What are you still doing here? Mei: I was waiting for you to finish. Kousei: You could've waited inside. Mei: Ahaha. I didn't want to bother you guys. Mei: Anyway, I know I should've said something earlier... but would you mind walking me home? Kousei: Sure. I don't mind. Let's go. Mei: Thanks! Mei: Congratulations on getting your new recipe approved, by the way. Kousei: Well, you helped with that. Mei: Not at all. You did this on your own, Senpai. Kousei: Nah, it's all thanks to you. I would've never come up with this idea on my own. Kousei: Seriously, thank you. I'm really grateful. Kousei: This might sound kind of melodramatic... but I think I've gained a little more confidence in myself now. Mei: Ehehe... You're gonna make me blush. I don't mean to sound melodramatic either, but, like... Mei: You've done a lot for me as well, Senpai. Ever since you've helped me open up about my left eye, I feel like a huge weight's been lifted off my shoulders. Mei: That's why I wanted to be able to return the favor if I could. Mei: I'm glad I managed to be of some small help to you. Kousei: It wasn't small at all. You were a big help. Kousei: I was hoping to do something like this before I had to deal with my exams, so I'm glad it all went so well. Mei: Oh, your exams are coming up? Kousei: At the end of the month, yeah. Mei: Does that mean you're gonna be working fewer hours? Kousei: No, I'll be working the same as usual. I'll do fine as long as I pay attention in class. Kousei: And I can always study after work too. Mei: You're a pretty diligent student, aren't you? Kousei: I don't know about that... I'm just the sort of guy who hates procrastinating. Mei: That's what it means to be diligent, Senpai. I think that's something to be proud of. Kousei: Nah, trust me... I can be pretty lazy when I want. Mei: But in front of me, at least, you're always hardworking and dependable. Kousei: Okay, sheesh. Stop flattering me. It's gonna go to my head. Mei: Ahaha! Alright. Mei: Well, good night, Senpai. Kousei: Good night. And sorry you had to wait for me earlier. Mei: That's okay. I waited because I wanted to congratulate you. Mei: Anyway, see you tomorrow! Kousei: Yeah. See you tomorrow. Mei: ...... Mei: Hmm... Exams... , Mei: Good morning! Natsume: Good morning. Kanna: Good morning. How was yesterday? Mei: I'm sorry? Natsume: She's talking about your date with Takamine-kun. Mei: My... WHAT? Kanna: You went somewhere together, didn't you? Mei: W-Well, yeah... Natsume: He didn't do anything stupid, did he? Kanna: We were worried that he'd get too carried away and blow his chance. Natsume: Yeah. He seems like the kind of guy to get way too worked up over a date. Mei: Wait, what? What? Suzune: Whoa there. Don't go having this conversation without me! Mei: Ah... Suzune-san. Good morning. Suzune: Good morning. So? You guys were talking about yesterday? Natsume: Yes. Suzune: How was it? How far did you two go? Mei: H-How far? Kanna: Jumping straight into it, are we? Suzune: I know you're just as curious as I am. I mean, they've basically seen each other naked now, no? Mei: WHAT?! Natsume: Wait, really? You've already done THAT? Mei: Oh, no! No, no, no! I mean--WHAT?! Suzune: Okay, maybe that was a bit misleading. I just meant they've seen each other in swimsuits. Mei: A bit?! That was EXTREMELY misleading! Kanna: Oh... so you went swimming? At a hot spring? Mei: We went swimming, yes, but at a pool... Natsume: Really? I didn't know they were already open at this time of year. Suzune: I think she means the big one nearby. It's a heated indoor swimming pool. Natsume: Oh, that sounds like a nice place to go to on a date. Mei: Actually, we went to the one by the station... Suzune: Wait, there's a pool by the station? When did they build that? Natsume: It must have a hot spring built in too. If it's by the station, I should go check it out myself sometime. Mei: Umm... No, it's not that sort of pool. It's a gym... Natsume: What? A gym? Mei: Yes. Like, a fitness center... Kanna: You went to a fitness center together? Mei: Yes... That is indeed where we went. Suzune: Oh. I thought for sure you went to a recreational pool to mess around and have fun. Mei: We just went to do some exercise. Separately... Kanna: Separately? Natsume: That... doesn't sound like much of a date. Suzune: More like a workout, than anything. Kanna: That's rather disappointing... Mei: Wh-What do you mean? It wasn't supposed to be a date! Suzune: Oh, come on. Don't be shy. Mei: I'm telling you, it wasn't a date! Suzune: Psh. That's lame. Mei: H-How? Natsume: A gym, huh? Well, I can certainly see that, coming from you. Mei: ...... Kanna: What's the matter? Mei: No, it's just... I feel a little dumb about the whole thing... Natsume: What for? Mei: The truth is, Senpai thought we were going to a recreational pool as well, but the idea hadn't crossed my mind at all... Suzune: Ahh. So Kousei was the only one who thought it was a date. Mei: N-No, I don't think that's the case... Mei: But still, he was absolutely right. We shouldn't have gone to a fitness center pool... Natsume: Oh, okay. So you wish you'd picked a better place for a date as well. Mei: F-For the last time, it wasn't a date! Kanna: Then allow me to be frank. How do you feel about him? Mei: Who? Kanna: Takamine-san, of course. Mei: Huh? Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What do you mean by that? Natsume: That reaction already says it all. Mei: N-No, I just, um... I have a lot of respect for him. Natsume: Respect? Mei: Y-Yes. Natsume: You... respect him? Kanna: Please don't look so bewildered. I feel bad for him now. Natsume: Sorry. Suzune: You respect him, nothing more? Mei: Huh? Well, um... I guess it's not only that... Mei: But... it's mostly respect... I think... Suzune: Hmm. Suzune: ...... Suzune: Nozomi-san's coming in today, isn't she? Kanna: Yes. Her shift starts at lunch. Suzune: Good. Are you all busy tonight? Natsume: Not particularly. Kanna: I don't have any plans either. Suzune: Well, if Nozomi-san's free as well, let's have a girls' night out! Suzune: Against the four of us, Mei-san doesn't stand a chance. Mei: Wait! What are you going to do to me?! Kanna: That's a great idea. Natsume: Sounds like fun. Mei: What? Huh? Why? Suzune: ...... Mei: Wh-What? Why are you grinning at me like that? Seriously, what? Suzune: Alright! Time to get to work, everybody! Kanna: Let's get down to it! Natsume: I'm looking forward to tonight. Mei: Wait, what? Hold up. Mei: Seriously? Kousei: See you guys later. Natsume: See you. Suzune: Where do you girls want to go? Should we find a restaurant somewhere? Kousei: Oh, are you all going out to eat? Kanna: We're having a girls' night out tonight. Nozomi: I can't wait. *giggle* Mei: ...... Kousei: Is it just me, or is Hiuchidani-san the only one not very excited about it? Natsume: Don't be silly. She's totally excited. Right? Mei: Yes. I am very excited. Kousei: Huh. Could've fooled me. Suzune: Actually, why don't we just go to my place? We'll have a hard time finding any places open this late. Natsume: True. We can just stop by a convenience store on the way and buy something there. Suzune: Alright. Let's get going. Suzune: Oh, and no boys allowed, so go kill some time before you follow us home, Kousei. Kousei: Huh? But if we're all going to the same apartment complex, why can't I just-- Suzune: No can do. Our girls' night out is already underway. Kousei: Fine. Suzune: Come on, girls. Let's go. Nozomi: Okaay. Mei: ...... Kousei: You alright, Hiuchidani-san? Mei: ...... Kousei: I'm gonna take that as a \"no.\" Suzune: Come on, Mei-san. Mei: Okay... Kousei: ...... Kousei: Weird. Suzune: Anyone want a beer? Natsume: I'm fine. Kanna: No, thank you. Suzune: Oh, well. More for me. Nozomi: Uh, so I forgot to ask, but why exactly are we having a girls' night out anyway? Suzune: So we can interrogate Mei-san about her relationship with Kousei. Nozomi: Her relationship with Kousei-kun? Mei: I wanna go home. Suzune: Aww, c'mon. We won't ask you anything too invasive. Just play along with us for tonight. Mei: *sigh*... What do you want to know? Kanna: In all honesty, how do you feel about Takamine-san? Mei: Cutting right to the chase, huh. I already answered that this morning, didn't I? Kanna: You said you respected him, but is that really all there is to it? Mei: I mean... Nozomi: Did something happen between them? Natsume: They went out somewhere together yesterday. Nozomi: Oh, phew. That's not bad... Suzune: What do you mean? Nozomi: I was afraid they'd gotten into a fight or something. Suzune: Oh, no. Just the opposite. They've actually been getting quite chummy lately. Nozomi: Oh, really? Natsume: How do you feel about all this, Sumizome-san? You're his childhood friend. Nozomi: He's never really been popular with girls, so honestly... I think it's great! It feels like my little Kousei-kun is finally growing up! Kanna: It almost sounds like you're talking about him as a brother. Nozomi: Well, we have known each other for a long time. That's just what happens. Kanna: There's your answer. Mei: What? Seriously, what? How do you want me to respond to that? Suzune: Let me be serious with you for a moment. Mei: Um, okay. Suzune: Whenever you have men and women working in the same place, it often presents a unique problem. Mei: Okay? Suzune: See, it's fine if they get along well, but if things turn sour, that can affect the atmosphere of the entire workplace, reducing productivity. Suzune: In order to avoid such things, it's therefore important for me to have a clear understanding of my coworkers' interpersonal relationships. Mei: Oh. I think I get that... Mei: ...... Mei: Did you really need to invite everyone else here for that, though? Suzune: Nope. Mei: What? Suzune: I just thought it'd be funner with more people. Mei: Seriously? Suzune: I won't deny that I'm doing this for amusement, but I also want to support you. Suzune: All you guys feel that way too, right? Natsume: Well, half that, and half out of curiosity. Kanna: I came 100\\% out of curiosity. Nozomi: In that case, I came 100\\% to support you! Suzune: See? Mei: Oh, uh... Thanks? Natsume: To be honest, like Suzune-san said, I want to know how things are going between you two as well--even though it's not really any of my business. Natsume: The cafe is just a really important place to me, so I'd hate for there to be any problems caused by interpersonal relationships. Natsume: Maybe I'm just a cynic, but I feel like it's all too easy for office romances to lead to those sorts of conflicts. Mei: Romance? Umm... I had a feeling that's where this was going, but, like... Natsume: Am I wrong? Mei: I don't think things between me and him are... like that. Kanna: You don't sound very confident. Mei: I mean, I don't have any experience with relationships, so I don't really know... Suzune: It definitely seems like you've got chemistry, though. From what I've seen, at least. Mei: Chemistry? Kanna: I agree. You become much more animated when you're talking with Takamine-san compared to when you talk with us. Mei: I-Is that true? I've never realized that myself... Natsume: I'd go so far as to say your eyes start to sparkle... maybe? Well, you get the idea. Suzune: You always go \"Senpai, Senpai!\" in such a cheerful voice. Whenever you're with Kousei, you seem even more upbeat than usual. Mei: What? Seriously? Natsume: What do you think, Sumizome-san? Have you noticed any recent changes in Takamine-kun's behavior? Nozomi: Hmm... I don't know. They definitely get along well, that's for sure. Nozomi: Ah--but I guess he seems a lot more... relaxed whenever he's around Mei-chan. Compared to Natsume-san and Kanna-san, for example. Natsume: True. He won't even sit beside me in class. Nozomi: Not a surprise. He's not really used to dealing with girls. Nozomi: But when he's with Mei-chan, I feel like he's more comfortable acting natural. Natsume: Hmm. I guess part of it might have to do with her being younger. Suzune: Not all the time, though. Yesterday he was all restless and fidgety. Mei: What? He was? Suzune: Yep. He was having a bit of trouble concentrating on work. Suzune: It made me smile, but he also kind of needed to get his act together. Suzune: So in all seriousness, the sooner you two sort out your feelings, the happier I'll be. Mei: Urk... Easier said than done... Kanna: It's almost Valentine's Day too. The timing couldn't be better. Nozomi: Oh, Valentine's Day! Are we doing anything special at the cafe? Natsume: Hopefully. Suzune-san and I are still figuring out what, though. Suzune: We'll probably do another limited-time special like we did on Christmas. I doubt it'll be as hectic this time around, though. Nozomi: True. People don't usually buy their Valentine's chocolates from cake shops. Suzune: If only chocolate had a longer shelf life. But yeah, that's why it's just going to be a limited-time thing, for girls to buy for their acquaintances and such. Suzune: You know, friend-chocolate. Kanna: Oh, that's right! I nearly forgot to ask. What should we do about OUR chocolates? Natsume: You mean for Takamine-kun? Kanna: Yes. And Mikado-san too. I wasn't sure if we should give our male coworkers chocolates. Nozomi: Why don't we give them one big gift, from all of us? That way it'll be easier for them to prepare a return gift too, as opposed to having to buy a gift for each of us individually. Natsume: Good idea. He'd probably be disappointed if we didn't get him anything. Suzune: In that case, Mei-san can get him something a little more personal. Mei: Gosh, why do we keep going here? Suzune: Well, it's either that or you pitch in with the rest of us. Which do you want? Mei: Well... I mean... Urk... Suzune: See? You don't want to, do you? Mei: Well, I mean... he does a lot for me, so, like... Mei: If I'm going to give him something... I want it to be from ME. Natsume: That's the only reason? Mei: Urk... Kanna: Oh? You're not denying it. Mei: I don't know what you want me to say... Mei: Ngh! Mei: I really don't know. I mean, I do l-like him, of course... Mei: But I just like him as a person... I don't know if that means I l-love him or not. Suzune: Ahhh! So adorbs! My heart can't take it! Natsume: God, what's gotten into you? Are you drunk? Suzune: A little. Kanna: Let me ask you this then. If Takamine-san started getting chummy with another girl, how would that make you feel? Mei: Hmm... Natsume: Out of all of us, I'd say he's closest to Sumizome-san, right? Nozomi: I guess, considering how long we've known each other. Suzune: Do you ever feel like there's a side of him only you know about? Nozomi: Something only I know? Let me think... Nozomi: His face when he wakes up, I guess? Kanna: You're not talking about what I think you are, are you? Nozomi: No, not like that. He gets up early by himself now, but I used to have to come over every morning to wake him up. Suzune: Ahh. I have a younger brother too, so I know what that's like. He'd always whine and yell when I yanked off his covers. Nozomi: Yeah... I once made the mistake of doing that too... Natsume: Why was it a mistake? Nozomi: You know how in the morning, guys get... um, you know... Suzune: Morning wood? Nozomi: Oh my god! You just outright said it! Mei: Morning what? Suzune: It's when guys get an uncontrollable erection in the morning. Mei: ...... Mei: Ahh! Suzune: Gee, what an adorable reaction. Nozomi-san, on the other hand, seems like she's pretty used to it. Nozomi: I wouldn't really say that. I've just happened to see it a few times, is all... Suzune: Oh-ho. So you've seen his erect ding-a-ling \"a few times,\" have you now? Natsume: His what? Kanna: She's definitely drunk, alright. Nozomi: I-It wasn't on purpose or anything, okay? It just happened on rare occasions when I came to wake him up... Suzune: Well, how does it feel knowing another woman's seen his, um... his wing-dang-doodle, Mei-san? Natsume: Excuse me? Kanna: You're a terrible drunk, Suzune-san. Suzune: Go ahead and tell us. Another woman's seen his private parts. How does that make you feel? Mei: Urk... Mei: Ngh... Mei: Nghhh! Mei: ...... Mei: It makes me feel... a little put out... I guess. Suzune: So you do have some feelings for him, deep down. Mei: Urk... I don't know... Suzune: Well, if you're planning to make him some homemade chocolate, let me know. I'll teach you everything you need to know. Mei: Homemade? But that'd totally make it seem like I... you know. Natsume: Like you're confessing to him, right. Mei: He might think I'm being too clingy, though... Nozomi: I don't know about that. I think he'd be thrilled. Suzune: So what do you say? Wanna make some homemade chocolate? Mei: Homemade chocolate... to confess my feelings... Homemade chocolate... Mei: Urk... Nghhhh! Mei: Ngh. Nozomi: M-Mei-chan? Natsume: She collapsed. Kanna: Her face is red as a beet too. Mei: I can't think straight anymore... My head's about to explode... Suzune: Aww, look at her. Acting all flustered like a young girl in love. Natsume: I feel like it's mostly your fault she's like this. Suzune: Sorry, she's just too cute. I can't help but tease her. Mei: Please, just let me go home already... I'm really not good with these sorts of conversations... Kanna: I know I said I only came because I was curious, but if you really are planning to confess to Takamine-san, I'll be glad to assist in any way I can. Kanna: I'd love for you two to be happily together. Nozomi: Me too! Let me know if there's anything I can do. Natsume: Alright. I think it's time we put this conversation to rest. It doesn't look like Hiuchidani-san can take much more. Mei: I can't... I'm about to die from embarrassment... Suzune: Man, what I wouldn't give to be young again... Kanna: What are you talking about? You're still plenty young. Suzune: There's a world of difference between being a student and being a working adult. Suzune: Time'll pass by before you know it, Mei-san. Make sure you don't leave any regrets behind. Mei: Urk... Alright. I'll try to think about how I really feel... Suzune: Honestly, though, it's already pretty clear to the rest of us. Kanna: That's just how love works. The person themselves can oftentimes be oblivious to the fact. Natsume: Very true. Nozomi: You three talk like you know a lot. You must have a ton of dating experience, huh? All Three: ...... Nozomi: Why did you all look away? Do you... not? Natsume: Anyway, why don't we start discussing our Valentine's Day menu? Suzune: Sounds like a great idea! Kanna: Indeed! Nozomi: Oops... I guess I shouldn't have asked. Mei: Urk... Mei: Do I really like him... that way? Mei: ...... Mei: Urk... I don't know! Ngh! Mei: G-Good morning! Kousei: What did you do to her yesterday? Suzune: Nothing. We just had a little chat. Kousei: ...... Suzune: Why are you giving me that look? Kousei: Because she's clearly acting weird. Suzune: Well, it's obvious why... Suzune: ...... Kousei: What do you mean? Suzune: Well, maybe I do owe her an apology. Kousei: What? Suzune: I might've teased her a little too much. Kousei: Huh? Suzune: Well, thankfully, we might see some progress now. Kousei: What progress? Suzune: You'll see soon enough. And you'd better thank me when it happens. Kousei: When what happens? Suzune: Uh-oh. Our orders are starting to pile up. Better get back to work. Kanna: Actually, Takamine-san, could I ask you and Mei-san to stay behind for a little while? Mei: Huh? Suzune: Hold on. What are you doing? Kanna: This doesn't have anything to do with what we discussed yesterday. I just need to talk to them about their shifts. Suzune: Oh, okay. Suzune: Well, see you all tomorrow! Natsume: Bye, everyone. Kanna: No, of course not. Kousei: I thought so. This is about Hiuchidani-san's eye, isn't it? Mikado: Yes, indeed. Mei: I forgot to ask before, but does anyone at the cafe else know about my eye? Mikado: Natsume knows. Suzune and Nozomi do not, however. Mei: Natsume-san san knows too? That's a relief. Kanna: Still, I must advise you not to speak with her about it too carelessly. We wouldn't want anyone overhearing you by accident. Mei: Alright. Mikado: How are things going with your eye? Mei: Nothing much has changed. Mikado: Which means you haven't found a way to release your butterflies yet? Mei: Err... No, not yet. Kanna: We haven't had many opportunities to practice, after all. Would you like to do some now? Mei: Sure. Mei: But that being said... Mikado: You said you are able to capture butterflies simply by staring at them, correct? Mei: Yeah. After I stare at them for a while, they just disappear. Kanna: In that case, perhaps you could do the opposite, and try staring at an empty space while imagining them appearing. Mei: Imagine them appearing? Mei: Nghhh... Mei: ...... Mei: It's not working. Kousei: What about other people who had the eye? How did they release their butterflies? Mikado: Well, if we knew that, we would not be having this problem. Kousei: Good point. But haven't any other Grim Reapers documented it? Kanna: We've tried searching for more information, but no such luck. Kanna: And to the best of my knowledge, Mei-san is the only person who possesses the eye yet can't see the butterflies. Kousei: So she's an anomaly? Mikado: We don't know that either. People who possess the eye are rare enough in and of themselves. There is simply not enough information. Mikado: That is precisely what makes her such an interesting case study. Kousei: You make her sound like some kind of guinea pig... Mei: That's okay. I want to find out everything I can about my eye as well. Mei: If anything, I should be the one apologizing for being so unhelpful... Kanna: If only I could use my scythe to retrieve the butterflies from your eye... Kousei: You can't? Kanna: I don't dare try. It could end up causing unforeseen damage to Mei-san's soul. Kanna: Perhaps if I knew exactly where the butterflies were located, I might be able to do something about it, but I don't. Mikado: We are no longer able to sense butterflies that have been captured by the eye. Mikado: That is why we did not realize that Mei possessed the eye in the first place. Kousei: Interesting. Kanna: I just had an idea, Mei-san. Mei: Yes? Kanna: Whenever you capture butterflies, is there anything in particular that you think of? Mei: Something I think of? Hmm... I'm not really sure... Kanna: So you do it without thinking? Mei: Well... I guess I think to myself, \"Go away!\" or something like that. Mei: But the very first time I ever noticed a wisp... Mei: ...... Mei: I was mostly just curious. \"What is that?\" I thought, and so I kept staring at it until it disappeared. Mei: That's what crossed my mind the first time it happened, at least. Kanna: Just curiosity... Kousei: So then if she does the opposite, and tries NOT to think about the butterflies, she'll be able to release them? Mikado: You realize that, until just recently, she had no idea that there were even butterflies inside her? Kousei: Oh, right. I guess she hasn't been thinking about them this whole time. I wonder what it is she needs then? Kanna: Maybe what she needs is... something more concrete. Mei: What do you mean? Kanna: If, by thinking about \"butterflies\", you are able to capture them... Kanna: Then perhaps by focusing your thoughts on a specific \"place\", you'll be able to release them. Mei: Oh. So instead of just vaguely trying to release them anywhere, I should try to think about releasing them towards someplace specific? Kanna: Why don't you give it a shot? Mei: Alrighty! Mei: Ngh... Mei: Nghh! Mei: C'mon, the chair... The chair! Mei: Nggghhhhh! Mikado: It doesn't seem to be working. Mei: I'm sorry... Kanna: Maybe you aren't focusing hard enough... or maybe I'm just completely wrong. Kanna: Hmm... Kanna: Your Excellency. Mikado: Yes? Kanna: Please turn into your cat form. Mikado: I beg your pardon? Kanna: Please turn into your cat form. Mikado: I refuse. Kanna: Please turn into your cat form. Mikado: You can repeat yourself however many times you wish, but no means no! Kanna: Please! I'm sure this will work! Remember that Mei-san has an abnormal fixation with cats. Mikado: I will not! Mei: A-Abnormal fixation? That's mean... Kousei: Well... she's not wrong. Mei: You too, Senpai?! Kousei: I mean... you turn pretty crazy whenever you see a cat. Kanna: To put it bluntly, you turn into a complete maniac. Mei: W-Wow! You're so mean! Kanna: We've got nothing to lose by trying. Please, Your Excellency! This is for Mei-san's sake! Mikado: Kgh... Very well. But you had best keep yourself under control this time, Mei. Mei: Don't worry! I will, I promise! Mikado: I do not believe you! Kanna: Please, Your Excellency. Hurry it up! Mikado: Fine... Have your wish! Mei: Ahhhhhhh! Mikado: Mei! Have you already forgotten your promise?! Mei: R-R-Relax! I-I'm fine! I-I'm completely calm! Kousei: That look in your eyes begs to differ... Kanna: This is just a guess... but Mei-san seems like the kind of person stray cats run from. Mei: How did you know? It's true; even cats that are used to people always run away from me! I wonder why? Mikado: Is it not painfully obvious? Kanna: Now then, Mei-san. Please try imagining your butterflies being released around His Excellency. Mei: R-Right! A-Around His Excellency! Y-Yes! O-Of course! Mikado: I do not wish to be rude, Mei, but I find your behavior most repulsive right now. Kousei: That's about as rude as it gets, though. Mei: I don't mind! He can call me repulsive as much as he wants! Kousei: You've got problems, Hiuchidani-san. Seriously. Mei: A-Anyway, here I go! Mikado: Very well. But you can do it standing from there. Do not come any closer, you hear? Mei: A-Alright! *pant*... *pant*... Mikado: ...... Mei: *pant*... *pant*! Mikado: Why are you breathing so heavily? Mei: *PANT*... *PANT*! Mikado: Enough! If this goes on any further, I will not be safe! Mei: *PAAAANT*! Kanna: Alright, Mei-san. Settle down, settle down. Mei: Huh? It's over? My time's up already? Wait! How much do I have to pay for an extension?! Mikado: What on earth is this child talking about? Kousei: Well, I guess that didn't work either. Kanna: My idea must've been wrong. I suppose we'll have to think this over some more. Mei: Five thousand yen! I'll pay five thousand yen! Mikado: That is quite enough. Playtime is over. Mei: Ahh... He's gone... Mikado: Good grief. I am beginning to suspect that this derangement of yours is a side effect of using your eye... Mei: What do you mean? I was totally calm and collected. Kousei: ...... Kanna: ...... Mikado: I believe you have something to say to me, Mei. Mei: Okay, fine! I'm sorry! Kanna: Anyway, why don't we stop here for today? Mikado: Before we do, though, I must ask. Have you captured any other butterflies lately besides the ones in the cafe? Mei: No. I haven't used my powers at all outside of the cafe. Mikado: Alright. Very well. Kanna: If that's all, then we'll see you-- Mei: Actually, can I ask one more thing? Mikado: Yes? Mei: Is it possible that using my eye... could have a negative effect on the person? Kanna: You mean when you use it to capture butterflies? Mei: Yeah. You said that it had the power to heal people's souls, but, um... how do I put this... Kousei: For example, if a person's soul was weakened because of a physical problem, healing their soul wouldn't resolve the underlying issue. Kousei: On the contrary, healing only their soul might have a negative effect on their body. Kousei: I think that's what Hiuchidani-san means to say. Mei: R-Right. That's it. Thank you. Mikado: Hmm... It is difficult to say for certain. Mei: In that case, isn't it kind of risky for me to be using my eye on our customers? Mikado: Perhaps. But it is also better than doing nothing. Mikado: There have been no instances of any customers returning to the cafe with new butterflies after you captured their old ones. Mikado: As of this moment, we have no reason to believe that the power of your eye has any negative effect on others. Mei: Oh... Kanna: Did something happen that caused you to think that it might? Mei: N-No, not exactly... Mei: ...... Mei: It's just... I feel like I've been getting a little carried away ever since I learned the truth about my eye, and learned that there were other people that understood me. Mei: If it turns out that my eye is causing others harm, though... I'd rather just stop using it altogether. Mikado: It is I who tasked you with capturing other people's butterflies. If there truly are any negative consequences of doing so, it would be my responsibility to bear. Mikado: So do not worry. Thanks to you, our job of collecting butterflies has been going remarkably smoothly. That is a fact. Mei: Okay. Thank you for saying that. Kanna: Are there any other questions you'd like to ask? Mei: No, that's all. Kanna: In that case, I'll see you both tomorrow. Good night. Mikado: Good night. Make sure you get plenty of rest. Mei: We will. Good night! Kousei: Good night. Kanna: ...... Mikado: Are you still worried? Kanna: I'm a little relieved, actually, knowing that Mei-san has her own reservations about using her eye. Mikado: I've never been worried about that myself. Despite appearances, she is a very rational-- Mikado: ...... Kanna: Struggling to finish that sentence, aren't you? Mikado: Allow me to rephrase. Although she tends to lose her head under certain circumstances, she is generally a very compassionate person. Mikado: She is the sort of person who would never even think about abusing the power of her eye. Kanna: I'm not worried about that either. I trust Mei-san completely. Kanna: What worries me is... something else. Mikado: We've already warned her many times not to let anyone realize the truth about her eye. Kanna: I know. Of course, times have changed now, but still... Mikado: People's hearts remain largely the same. Kanna: That's why I was against using her eye in the first place. Kanna: There may not be any problems right now, but if things start to fall apart, Mei-san will be the one to suffer. Kanna: And all the positive influence she's been having on Takamine-san's soul will be for naught. Kanna: If anything were to happen to Mei-san, Takamine-san would undoubtedly be greatly affected as well. Mikado: Hmm. So it is not Mei, but Takamine Kousei you are worried about? Kanna: I'm worried about them both. But... I realize I may just be feeling overprotective. Kanna: If you wish for her to have full control over the power of her eye, I won't object. Rest assured. Mikado: I understand that you are concerned, but we cannot allow these butterflies to simply remain inside of Mei either. Kanna: I know. Mikado: Incidentally, Kanna. Kanna: Yes? Mikado: What exactly was it that you and Mei spoke about yesterday? I understand you and the others had a \"girls' night out.\" Kanna: Tsk, tsk. How rude, Your Excellency. You mustn't ask a young lady to divulge her secrets. Mikado: Ah. So it was nothing of importance then. Kanna: Nihihi. Nope. Just a little gossip between girls, is all. Kanna: I do hope everything works out between those two, though... Mei: Oh... yeah. It's been weighing on my mind for a while now. Mei: The truth is, I've been getting a little carried away ever since His Excellency gave me this task. Mei: I'm worried that I've only been adding to people's troubles, like I did to her. Mei: I was starting to question whether capturing our customer's wisps was the right thing to do. Kousei: Hmm... It's hard to say. Mei: Yeah. It is. Kousei: But you know, I've been thinking as well. Kousei: I suggested that maybe this friend of yours had a physical problem, and that's why she still hasn't gotten better. Kousei: But after you'd cast your \"magic spell\" on her, you saw a significant improvement in her mood, didn't you? Mei: Yeah. While I wouldn't say she recovered completely, there was definitely a big improvement. Kousei: If that's true, then it must be some sort of emotional problem. That's why the power of your eye was able to cheer her up temporarily. Kousei: And in that case, there's no doubt in my mind that your \"magic spell\" provided her with some much-needed relief. Kousei: While it's unfortunate that she ended up becoming overly dependent on it, it's clear that the weight in your friend's heart was lightened because of you. Kousei: If I had to say whether it was the right or wrong decision, I'd have to say it was right. Kousei: So I don't think there's anything you should feel guilty or anxious about. Kousei: The power in your left eye is unmistakably a power that helps others. And I'm certain it'll help a lot more people from now on. Mei: ...... Kousei: Uh... sorry. Maybe it's not my place to say anything. Mei: N-No, don't apologize... Mei: ...... Mei: C-Can you read my mind, Senpai? Kousei: Huh? Mei: It makes me really happy... You always seem to know exactly what I want to hear. Mei: It almost feels like you know exactly what I'm thinking all the time. Kousei: Nah... I'm not that sensitive, to be honest. In fact, I can be downright insensitive sometimes. Kousei: But one thing I will say is that I'm not saying these things just to cheer you up. Kousei: I mean it. All of it. Kousei: The stuff about me being grateful to you, and the stuff about your eye--you, helping other people. Kousei: I mean all of it, from the bottom of my heart. Kousei: And if I managed to get that message across to you, well... then that'd make me happy too. Mei: ...... Kousei: Sorry if I seem like I'm trying too hard to be cool or something. I'm lame, I know. Mei: N-No! You're really not... Mei: ...... Mei: U-Umm! Kousei: Hm? Mei: Do you like sweets, Senpai? Kousei: Huh? What's this about? Mei: Do you? Kousei: Well, sure, I guess. Mei: Okay, great! Good night! Kousei: Huh? O-Oh. Yeah, g'night. Mei: Thanks for walking me home! See you tomorrow! Kousei: R-Right. See you tomorrow... Mei: ...... Mei: Hi, Suzune-san? It's me, Mei. I'm sorry for the random call... Mei: Um, I was wondering something... Mei: ...... Mei: C-Could you teach me how to make my own chocolate? \n\nWhile these examples may provide some guidance, evaluate their relevance to the current conversation.

            "Suzune: Crud. Looks like I'm all out of beer. Mei: Would you like some tea? I haven't drunk directly out of this one yet. Suzune: Sure. By the way, these kelp rolls are delicious. Mei: Hehe. I'll be sure to let my grandma know. Have as many as you want! Suzune: Hey, Kousei! Is it ready yet? I'm already getting full from all these kelp rolls! Kousei: Sorry for the wait. I just finished now. Mei: But you added some kind of smoked ingredient, didn't you? Kousei: You'll see. Go ahead and try it. Suzune: Uh-huh. Mei: ...... Suzune: ...... Mei: Oh? Suzune: Something tastes different. It's a lot more fragrant when I bite into it. Mei: It can't be the bacon, right? Where's this smoky flavor coming from? Suzune: It doesn't seem to be the vegetables, either... What exactly did you do? Kousei: It's the black pepper. That's what I smoked. Mei: Ohh! It's the seasoning! Kousei: Yeah. In a way, black pepper is actually the main ingredient in carbonara. That's where the name of the dish comes from, in fact. Suzune: It's derived from the Italian word for charcoal burner, right? Because there's supposed to be so much pepper on it that it turns black. Kousei: Exactly. I was contemplating whether or not to smoke the salt, but I thought that would change the flavor too much. Kousei: So I decided to smoke the pepper instead. This way it adds a nice kick without destroying the balance of the dish. Suzune: You're right. It really does add a nice kick. It's amazing how a small addition can make such a big difference. Suzune: Even though the seasoning is fundamentally the same, the flavor has a lot more depth. Mei: This is amazing! Just like authentic carbonara! Not that I know what authentic carbonara tastes like, but still! Kousei: Glad you like it. I only just finished smoking the pepper, so the smell might be a little harsh-- Kousei: But as long as I let it sit for a while, it should disappear. Then all I need to do is mix it with some regular black pepper to fine tune the flavor. Suzune: Sounds good. It could use a bit of adjusting, but I definitely think this is good enough to serve to our customers. In all honesty, this really is delicious. Kousei: Thanks. What about you-- Mei: Phew! That was good! Kousei: Wow. Not even a crumb left. Mei: It was too good! Just like real Italian cuisine! Not that I know what real Italian cuisine tastes like, but still! Suzune: You already said that earlier. I get what you're trying to say, though. Kousei: Ahaha... I wasn't expecting this much of a reaction. I'm flattered. Mei: Seriously, it was delicious! You're a genius, Senpai! Kousei: O-Oh stop it... Suzune: Well, since Mei-san is showering you in praise, I'm going to be a little more critical. Suzune: Like you said before, the dish still needs some balancing. Kousei: I know. It's got a pretty strong flavor, so I'm gonna try letting it mellow overnight next time. Suzune: Instead of trying to figure out everything on your own, though, you should ask the others at the cafe to taste-test your dish first. Suzune: Then you can decide if you want to tone it down, or if you actually want to emphasize that distinct flavor. Mei: Ohh, I see! The more unique it tastes, the more likely it is to grab people's interest! Suzune: Exactly. But you might get differing opinions on which one is better, which'll make it harder to decide. Suzune: Still, it's up to you. At the very least, I don't think anyone's going to object to you adding this dish to our menu. Kousei: Alright. I'll give it a shot. Kousei: And thanks, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Huh? Kousei: I wouldn't have come up with this idea without you, so thanks. Mei: Please! All I did was suggest the first thing that came to mind. Mei: Don't underestimate your own genius, Senpai! This really is amazing! Kousei: Th-Thanks. Suzune: Ahem. Kousei: Wh-What? Suzune: We're all out of cheese and sausages, so I'm gonna need you to make me some more. Kousei: You already ate them all? I wanted some too, you know. Suzune: Oh, stop griping. C'mon! Kousei: Alright, alright. Fine. Mei: Senpai! I want to try smoking some other things too! Kousei: Sure. I'll rummage around my fridge and see what else we can toss in the smoker. Mei: This is gonna be great! Kanna: Here's to another great year! Let's all do our best! Suzune: Alrighty. Ready to get back to work? Kousei: Yes, ma'am. Kousei: Not so much changed as added a new twist. I tried smoking the pepper first. Natsume: I can't say it looks or smells particularly different, though... Kousei: You'll see once you try it. Nozomi: Well, I'm gonna go ahead and dig in! Nozomi: That faint hint of smokiness... It's amazing how much difference it makes. Natsume: You said you smoked it yourself? Kousei: Yep. It was all Hiuchidani-san's idea. Mei: Don't be silly. You came up with the idea to smoke the black pepper. Mei: All I did was suggest that we try to make our own bacon. Natsume: Ah. So you spent the break thinking up ways to improve our menu... Natsume: That's very commendable of you. I'm impressed. Kousei: Thanks. How do you think it tastes? Kanna: I, for one, think it's delicious. It gives the dish a lot more added depth. Nozomi: I think so too. This seems like it'd be a real crowd-pleaser. Natsume: It certainly is delicious, but... Kousei: But? Natsume: I feel like the pepper's unique smokiness has a sort of... mature taste to it. Natsume: It's definitely not bad by any means, but--and this is just my personal opinion... Natsume: But I think I actually prefer the regular carbonara. Natsume: So while I'm all for adding this to our menu, I don't think it should replace the original version. Nozomi: You said you added the smoked black pepper to the pasta at the end, right? Kousei: Yeah, I did. Nozomi: In that case, why don't we just serve our regular carbonara with a shaker of smoked black pepper on the side? Nozomi: That way, customers can add as much or as little as they want. Natsume: How would we know how much to prepare in advance, though? Some customers might use a lot more than others. Suzune: A lot of beef bowl restaurants used to do the same thing with their special shichimi spices, but they had to stop the practice a little while back. Suzune: Some customers were using unbelievable amounts of spice, which ended up hurting their profits. Nozomi: Oh... I guess that won't work then. Kanna: It seems like our safest option would be to add this smoked pepper version as a separate item on the menu. Kousei: Alright. So I have all the judges' approval? Kanna: Absolutely. I think this would make a fine addition to our menu. Nozomi: Me too. Natsume: Me three. Kanna: What do you think, Mikado-san? Mikado: I believe Natsume mentioned earlier that this dish had a rather mature taste. However, many of our customers also come here specifically for our coffee and tea. Mikado: Judging from what I have gathered, this would suit their preferences well. Mikado: Therefore, I am in agreement. Kousei: Thank goodness... Mei: Way to go, Senpai! Kousei: Thanks! Kousei: I was just gonna do it at home, actually... Mikado: Among other problems, that would be quite expensive. I would not recommend you do that. Kousei: I guess that's true. Mikado: I do have some other ideas you may wish to consider. Are you free to talk after this? Kousei: Sure. I've got time. Kanna: In that case, let's call it a day here. See you tomorrow, everyone. Natsume: See you tomorrow. Nozomi: See you tomorrow! Kousei: Phew... Kousei: Huh? Hiuchidani-san? Mei: Hey. Kousei: What are you still doing here? Mei: I was waiting for you to finish. Kousei: You could've waited inside. Mei: Ahaha. I didn't want to bother you guys. Mei: Anyway, I know I should've said something earlier... but would you mind walking me home? Kousei: Sure. I don't mind. Let's go. Mei: Thanks! Mei: Congratulations on getting your new recipe approved, by the way. Kousei: Well, you helped with that. Mei: Not at all. You did this on your own, Senpai. Kousei: Nah, it's all thanks to you. I would've never come up with this idea on my own. Kousei: Seriously, thank you. I'm really grateful. Kousei: This might sound kind of melodramatic... but I think I've gained a little more confidence in myself now. Mei: Ehehe... You're gonna make me blush. I don't mean to sound melodramatic either, but, like... Mei: You've done a lot for me as well, Senpai. Ever since you've helped me open up about my left eye, I feel like a huge weight's been lifted off my shoulders. Mei: That's why I wanted to be able to return the favor if I could. Mei: I'm glad I managed to be of some small help to you. Kousei: It wasn't small at all. You were a big help. Kousei: I was hoping to do something like this before I had to deal with my exams, so I'm glad it all went so well. Mei: Oh, your exams are coming up? Kousei: At the end of the month, yeah. Mei: Does that mean you're gonna be working fewer hours? Kousei: No, I'll be working the same as usual. I'll do fine as long as I pay attention in class. Kousei: And I can always study after work too. Mei: You're a pretty diligent student, aren't you? Kousei: I don't know about that... I'm just the sort of guy who hates procrastinating. Mei: That's what it means to be diligent, Senpai. I think that's something to be proud of. Kousei: Nah, trust me... I can be pretty lazy when I want. Mei: But in front of me, at least, you're always hardworking and dependable. Kousei: Okay, sheesh. Stop flattering me. It's gonna go to my head. Mei: Ahaha! Alright. Mei: Well, good night, Senpai. Kousei: Good night. And sorry you had to wait for me earlier. Mei: That's okay. I waited because I wanted to congratulate you. Mei: Anyway, see you tomorrow! Kousei: Yeah. See you tomorrow. Mei: ...... Mei: Hmm... Exams... ",
            "Mei: Phew. I thought I was running late, but it looks like you arrived at the same time as me. Kousei: Yeah, I just got out of class. Kousei: Shiki-san and Nozomi should already be here, so let's head inside. Mei: Okay. Mei: Good morning! Kanna: Welcome, you two. Mei: It's a little weird being greeted with a \"Welcome\" when the cafe's closed. Kanna: Then by that logic, saying \"Good morning\" is weird too, no? We're not working. Mei: I guess that's true. Kanna: You're here to study for your exams, right? Natsume-san and Nozomi-san are already here. Kousei: Yeah, sorry. Nozomi: It's fine. You two were in class. Natsume: You don't have to apologize. It's no big deal to us. Kanna: What would everyone like to drink? I'll prepare some refreshments. Nozomi: Huh? But... Kanna: It's no trouble at all. If it'll help you focus on your studies, I'd be happy to help. Nozomi: That's really nice of you. In that case, I'll have a cup of Earl Grey. Mei: Can I get a glass of orange juice? Kanna: Sure. Kanna: What about you two? Natsume: I'll have an Earl Grey too. Kousei: I'll have a coffee. Kanna: Alright. Kousei: Let's get to it then. Did you manage to find the stuff I asked for? Natsume: Here. These were the only ones I had left. Kousei: Thanks. These should help. Natsume: We might be in different majors, but you managed to get into Hitotsuboshi too, so you had to have gotten high grades yourself. Kousei: Well, I had a lot of help, as I'm sure you can imagine. Plus, my grades were only just barely good enough to be accepted. Nozomi: Urgh. These tests are crazy. I can't even figure out this last question with the answer in front of me. Mei: I'm getting a headache just looking at it. Kousei: Yeah, there are quite a few nasty questions in here. Natsume: You can thank my teacher, Saeki-sensei, for that. Apparently, he was a huge math buff. Natsume: Rumor had it he made these questions specifically to be solved using applied mathematics, just to show students the beauty of mathmatics. Nozomi: I'm going to go out on a limb and say he didn't succeed. Natsume: Yeah, most of us couldn't stand his class. Not that we hated him, per se; he was a fine person, just his tests were awful. Mei: That's what I hear too. Kousei: This teacher still teaches there? Mei: Yeah, he sure does. Kousei: Well, these tests should be great reference material then. Kousei: As for the English ones, all these questions seem pretty standard. Natsume: At least when I was there, the only subject that had insanely difficult questions was math. Kousei: Good. Then as long as we use these tests and the textbook to review, you should be able to avoid failing. Natsume: Sounds like a lot of rote memorization, though. Kousei: It'll have to do, for now. There's not enough time for her to re-learn all the material. Mei: Thank you very much. Nozomi: At the moment, I guess I'm struggling with Natsume-san's math questions the most. Nozomi: An in-depth explanation would really help. Natsume: Alright. I'll walk you both through it, so listen up. Nozomi: Okay! Mei: I'm all ears. Mei: Thank you! Nozomi: Sorry for the trouble. And thanks. Natsume: Thank you for doing this, Akizuki-san. Natsume: So anyway--if I apply this formula here, using the value I calculated above, that should give me the answer. Does that make sense? Nozomi: Ahh, I see. Now that you explain it like that, I sort of understand... Maybe... Maybe not? Mei: You're amazing, Nozomi-chan. I still don't get it at all! Natsume: Well, that's no surprise. You're learning from scratch. Natsume: I'll try to explain it as simply as I can, okay? But let me know right away if there's something you don't understand. Mei: Okaaay... *sigh*... Kousei: You're sighing way too much. Natsume: If you're not having any trouble with what I just explained, Sumizome-san, you can go ahead and start studying something else. Nozomi: Well, I wouldn't say I fully understand it yet. Nozomi: Alright, though. Can I borrow your English test? I want to use it to study. Natsume: Be my guest. Mei: Sorry I'm delaying us, Nozomi-san. Nozomi: Hey, it's not a big deal. Nozomi: The whole reason we're having this study session is to learn! Nozomi: So let's work hard and do our best to pass, okay? Mei: Yeah! Kanna: And here's your coffee, Takamine-san. Kousei: Oh, thanks. Kanna: By the way, what are you doing? Kousei: I'm putting together a list of stuff I want to cover. Kanna: Oh, okay. Preparing your teaching materials. Would you like me to help? Kousei: You'd be willing? Kanna: Don't worry. I can at least help you organize everything. Kanna: Everyone's studying their hardest. I want to chip in to help too. Kousei: Alright. Grab a seat. Kanna: Thank you. Nozomi: Kousei-kun, can I ask you something? Kousei: What's up? Nozomi: How come the answer to this one is number two? The other choices sound like they make sense too. Kousei: Hm? Let me see. Ah. Well, if you look at the paragraph before the blank, you can tell whether it's a factual or hypothetical statement. Kousei: The question is asking about something that happened in the past, so the answer has to be number two. Number one is a conjunction, so that wouldn't make sense. See? There's a comma here. Nozomi: Oh, you're right! Urk... Why didn't I catch that? Kousei: It's an easy mistake to make. This whole section can be a little tricky. Kousei: But it's something you need to know. You'll find these sorts of questions on the English proficiency test as well. Nozomi: Really? Alright, thanks. I'd better study it some more then. Kanna: You're actually quite smart, aren't you, Takamine-san? Nozomi: You wouldn't think it, would you? We've known each other for ages, and he always helps me study for tests, but even I still can't believe it sometimes. Nozomi: I never see him cramming at home, so I have no idea how his grades are so good. Kousei: Hey, I put in the effort just like everybody else. Kanna: Is that true? Kousei: The most efficient way to retain information is to pay attention in class. That, and taking notes. Kousei: If I do that, a single glance is all it takes to remember what I learned, which also helps me cut down on review time. Kanna: More haste, less speed, as they say. Nozomi: He's been saying that stuff for years. But if it was that easy to pay attention in class, we wouldn't be asking for help in the first place. Nozomi: Ugh, I can't do this. My concentration is shot. Mei: Me too. It feels like my brain is about to burn out... *sputter* *sputter*... Natsume: Oh, it's getting quite late. Alright. Let's call it a day. Mei: *siiigh* Thank you very much... Nozomi: Thank you! Natsume: You're welcome. So what do you think? Feeling a little more confident now? Mei: Uhh, yeah. I think I understand a bit more now... sort of. Natsume: Ah. Well, I'm glad my explanations made sense to you. Mei: I'll try reviewing everything again once I get home. Natsume: If there's anything you don't understand, let me know. Natsume: Even if it's something we've gone over already, don't be embarrassed. It happens sometimes. Mei: Okay. Thank you for your help. Kousei: Why don't we get you to take the same tests Shiki-san lent us tomorrow? Kousei: After you review the questions you get wrong, you can retake them again the next day. Natsume: I think that's a good idea too. Mei: But, like, won't I just be solving the same questions over and over? Natsume: There's nothing wrong with that. The worst thing would be for you to only think you understand. Kousei: Yeah, the goal here is to make sure you comprehend what you're learning. Kousei: If you can get the same grades Shiki-san did, you should be able to pass your exams without a hitch. But simply memorizing her answers won't mean anything. Mei: Yes, I know. Kousei: Are you okay with that too, Nozomi? Nozomi: Sounds good to me. Natsume: Starting tomorrow, I want you to come in to the cafe even on your days off. Kousei: We'll be able to help you study if you use the break room. Though it'll have to be while we're on the job. Mei: Alright. Thank you kindly. Kanna: Also, take these. I made copies of all your English and Japanese history study materials. Nozomi: Thank you so much! Kousei: Japanese history will largely be pure memorization, but for English, make sure you think about your answers carefully and review them. Mei: I will. Kousei: And thanks for helping out too, Akizuki-san. Kanna: Not at all. Helping people in need is also a part of my job now. Mei: Thanks for everything today. Natsume: Don't thank us just yet. Thank us once you've passed your exams. Mei: True. Alright then! I'll do my best! Nozomi: I'm hooome. Rokurou: Welcome back, Nozomi. Rokurou: Pretty late today, aren't you? I thought you didn't have work on Wednesdays. Nozomi: I was studying with a friend today. Kousei-kun and one of my coworkers were helping us prepare for our mid-terms. Nozomi: I wasn't playing around, so relax. Rokurou: That's not really what I'm worried about... Rokurou: I'm glad to see you working so hard, but make sure you don't overdo it. Rokurou: You've been staying up rather late these days, haven't you? Pulling all-nighters isn't good for your health. Nozomi: I know, geez. That's why I'm doing this now, so I don't have to stay up all night. Nozomi: Anyway, I'm going back to my room to do a bit more review. Rokurou: Don't you want to take a bath? Nozomi: Later. Nozomi: ...... Nozomi: ...... Nozomi: ... Nozomi: Nh... Ngh! Ahh, it's already this late? Nozomi: *sigh*... I studied a whole, whole lot. I've never been able to do this much on my own before. Nozomi: I'd better go take a bath now. If I don't get some sleep soon, I won't be able to wake up on time tomorrow. ",
            "Mei: Ah, Senpai! Kousei: Hey. You know, I just realized something after seeing your outfit. Mei: What's that? Kousei: You're on winter break. Mei: Ahaha! Seriously? Why do you think we're meeting up this early in the day? Kousei: True. For some reason, I guess I assumed you'd want to put all this off until after the holidays. Mei: I don't want school getting in the way. Plus, Suzune-san says we're going to be ridiculously busy on Christmas. Kousei: You're working on Christmas? Mei: Yep. I specifically asked to. Kousei: You aren't doing anything with your friends? Mei: Ahaha... Well, they've all got boyfriends, so... Kousei: Ah. Not too surprising then. Mei: You're working Christmas too, aren't you? And Christmas Eve as well, if I recall. Kousei: Yeah. I don't have any plans either, so I figured I might as well. Mei: Sad being single, isn't it? Kousei: Yeah... Mei: Well, not exactly. I recognize her, but I doubt she recognizes me. Mei: Yep. I thought I recognized her from somewhere, so I came here yesterday to double-check. And I was right. Kousei: Didn't take us long to find her, did it? Come to think of it, this is where you and I found out about Yuina's dad too. Mei: Hey, you're right! Maybe this is a lucky place. Kousei: Maybe. Or maybe it's you. Mei: Huh? Me? Kousei: It almost feels like you have a knack for running into people with butterflies or something. Mei: I'm not really sure how to feel about that. Kousei: Sorry. Just a thought. Kousei: Me neither. Mei: Weird. Maybe she isn't the same person? Kousei: Or maybe she already solved her own issues before we could intervene? Mei: I wonder... Hm? Wait, wh-what? Kousei: I see it. Mei: I've never seen anyone's wisps appear and disappear like that. Kousei: What do you mean? Mei: Ah. The guy's back. Kousei: ...... Mei: ...... Kousei: The butterfly's flying away. Mei: You're right. I... can't see the wisp anymore. Kousei: Hmm... Mei: Maybe that man has powers too. Powers like mine. Kousei: The power to repel butterflies, instead of attracting them? It's possible, I guess... Mei: Ah. We probably look really suspicious right now, don't we? Kousei: Huh? Oh, right. Why don't we go over there? Kousei: Hmm. Let's try giving Akizuki-san a call first. Kousei: This could be an unusual case, so we don't want to act rashly. Mei: Okay. Good point! Kanna: Hello? Kousei: This is Takamine. Kanna: Do you need something? Kanna: You said the butterfly disappears whenever this coworker of hers is nearby, correct? Kousei: Yeah. And whenever he leaves, the butterfly comes back. Kousei: Hiuchidani-san thought that maybe the man had some kind of power to repel butterflies... Kanna: *sigh* I didn't think you two were THIS obtuse... Kousei: Come again? Kanna: She's obviously lovestruck. Kousei: What? Sh-She's in love? Kanna: She is. If I had to guess, I'd say that this woman is secretly in love with her coworker. Kousei: She has a crush on him? Wait, really? That's why she's attracting butterflies? Kanna: Hey, don't be so dismissive of the power of love. Kanna: It has the power to incite our deepest, darkest passions. Love inflames the soul, for better or for worse. Kanna: And I would daresay that love is what's thrown that woman's emotions into turmoil. Kanna: She feels happy when they're together, but depressed when they're apart. Kanna: That would explain why the butterfly comes and goes like that. Kousei: I... guess? Kanna: She's probably agonizing over whether or not to confess her feelings to him. Kanna: But if she continues to remain under the butterfly's influence, she may lose hope and decide to give up on him altogether. Kousei: So we should use Hiuchidani-san's powers to capture her butterfly to prevent that from happening? Kanna: To be honest, I'm not entirely sure. If she ends up being rejected anyway, she may become even MORE susceptible to the butterfly's influence. Kanna: I'll leave it up to you to decide what to do, though. And again, please try not to draw unnecessary attention to yourselves. Kousei: I know. Thanks for the help, Akizuki-san. Kousei: Yeah. Apparently, the woman's in love with her coworker, and that's why her emotions are so unstable. Mei: Ohh... Sh-She's in love... That was why! Mei: Th-This feels, like, really embarrassing to say, even though she's a complete stranger... Kousei: It's almost Christmas too. She might be thinking about confessing to him tomorrow or the day after. Mei: Wh-What? Mei: Ngh... Ahh! Kousei: Y-You okay? Mei: I-I'm sorry. I'm just, um, not really used to talking about these sorts of things... Mei: It's getting me a little too worked up... Kousei: Want me to go get you something to drink? Mei: N-No, I'm fine... Kousei: Right. Whenever she's together with him, her spirits temporarily lift, which is why the wisp disappears. Kousei: But when they're apart, she goes back to feeling anxious, which is when the wisp returns. Kousei: Or at least, that's what Akizuki-san's theory is. Mei: Hrmm... Mei: ...... Mei: What if... Kousei: Hm? Mei: What if we do nothing and just let things run their course? Mei: Her wisp already goes away on its own from time to time without me having to make it disappear. Mei: I'm not sure I should be interfering... Kousei: Well... I suppose Akizuki-san DID say the situation wasn't urgent. Kousei: Trust me, you'd know if it was. There'd be a lot more butterflies. Kousei: That woman only has one or two around her at most, so she isn't terribly affected by them. At least, for now. Kousei: Even if we do nothing, it's possible that she'll overcome their influence on her own and confess her feelings. Kousei: But that said, we could still be way off mark. It may have nothing to do with love. Mei: Oh, true... There could be something else that's troubling her. Kousei: From Mikado's point of view, her personal problems aren't really our concern. The important thing is that we catch the butterfly. Mei: Yeah. That's their job, after all. Mei: Then I guess this was our only choice from the start... Mei: It's done. Kousei: Wow. Mei: Huh? Kousei: That was incredible. Beautiful, even. Mei: W-Was it? I can't really tell, myself... Kousei: It definitely looks like she has. Mei: I hope it goes well... Kousei: That's up to her. All we can do is pray that it does. Mei: Yeah. Kousei: If she gets rejected, though... Mei: Hey, don't say that, Senpai. You're gonna jinx it! Kousei: M-My bad. Kousei: Anyway, we've done all we can. The rest is out of our hands. Mei: Alrighty. Mission complete! Kousei: Yep. Not that I actually did anything. Mei: Ahaha! You phoned for help. That counts plenty, I think. Kousei: It'd feel weird to just go home now... Why don't we grab a drink or something? Mei: Good idea! I also want to see if anything happens between those two. Kousei: In that case, how about we get-- Mei: Let's get smoothies! Kousei: Thought you'd say that. Mei: Thanks for paying for me again. Kousei: No problem. It can be your reward for catching the butterfly. Mei: Hehe. You're the best. Mei: By the way, I heard that we're going to be helping bake cakes tomorrow. Kousei: Oh, right. Apparently we received a lot more orders than we expected, so we need all hands on deck. Kousei: Suzune-san wants everyone to pitch in and help. Mei: My shift doesn't start till the afternoon, though. Will I even make it in time to help? Kousei: Suzune-san says we'll be baking them so they're ready just in time for customers to pick up. Kousei: So don't worry. There's gonna be plenty of work to go around. Mei: Alrighty! I don't know if I'll be any good at baking, though... Kousei: You'll probably be put in charge of sales. Mei: Oh, right. I guess we can't have everyone making cakes. Mei: Sounds like it's gonna be a pretty tough day tomorrow. Let's get through this together! Kousei: It'll definitely be busy, but at least we'll get to spend the holidays together with everyone at the cafe. Mei: Ahaha! True that. Mei: Oh, Senpai! Look! Kousei: And it must've gone well. Mei: Yeah! I'm so happy for her. Mei: A Christmas date with her crush... How nice. Kousei: Too bad the only date we have is our jobs. Mei: Urk... Talk about depressing... Kousei: Well, you ready to get going? Mei: Sure. Kousei: We can tell Akizuki-san what happened tomorrow. It's gonna be a busy day, so we should get home early and rest up. Mei: Oh, well I wouldn't mind going to tell her right now, actually! Kousei: You just want to play with Mikado some more, don't you? Mei: Urk... How'd you know? Kousei: It was written all over your face. Mei: Ngh... Can you blame me?! His amazing fluffiness is enough to make anyone go crazy! Mei: Ah. I can be a little too candid sometimes, can't I? I'm sorry. I'll try to be more careful. Kousei: Eh, I don't mind. Feel free to be yourself. I'd prefer that, actually. Mei: Really? Well, please forgive me if I start acting too friendly. Ehehe. Mei: Welp, let's go on home! Kousei: Sounds like a plan. Mei: Let's work real hard tomorrow! Kousei: O-Okay... Kanna: Yes... Nozomi: I-I'll try to hang in there... Kanna: Still, it's not all bad. We wouldn't have gotten such a flood of orders if people didn't love your cakes. Nozomi: Even at my school, there are a ton of kids who are fans of your baking. Suzune: Well, I am a professional. Can't go losing to other restaurants in terms of quality. Suzune: Though... I do apologize for biting off more than I could chew. I knew I should've put a limit on the number of orders. Kousei: But it wasn't an impossible amount. We're nearly there. Kanna: Yeah. Let's hang in there just a little bit longer! Nozomi: Okay! Suzune: You can say that again. I'm exhausted... Natsume: I thought selling cakes would be easier than baking them... Boy, was I wrong. Kousei: I never stepped out of the kitchen today, but there must've been a crazy number of customers. Mei: You wouldn't believe it. We somehow managed to pull through with the three of us, but we could barely keep up. Natsume: Even without counting the people who were here to pick up advance orders, there were a ton of customers who came to buy our regular cakes too... Mei: But even those were flying off the shelves. Natsume: Yeah. I know you guys tried to restock them as fast as you could, but even then they would sell out almost instantly. Suzune: That's probably what I regret the most. Shouldn't have prioritized the advance orders so much. Mikado: Now I understand where the phrase \"selling like hotcakes\" comes from. It's incredible the effect the Christmas holidays have on sales. Kousei: Coming from someone on the kitchen side, you don't know the half of it. Suzune: I mean, they say sales typically go up tenfold on Christmas Eve. Cake stores everywhere are working overtime. Nozomi: Even though Christmas itself is tomorrow, it almost feels like we had more advance orders for today. Suzune: Yep. Christmas Eve is usually the peak in terms of sales. But make no mistake, we'll still be plenty busy tomorrow as well. Natsume: It's an excellent business opportunity, for sure. That said, I'm kind of worried that we're working you too hard, Suzune-san. Suzune: I could say the same for the rest of you. We've gotta strike while the iron's hot, though, so let's keep it up for one more day. Kanna: Agreed. Let's all get a good night's rest so we can be ready for tomorrow. Natsume: See you tomorrow, everyone. Mei & Nozomi: See you all tomorrow! Mei: Y-Yes. Mikado: Mei. Mei: Yes? Mikado: Why are you staring at me with those bloodshot eyes? Mei: I was, um... wondering if you could transform back into your-- Mikado: No. Mei: ...... Kanna: I've never seen anyone's spirits drop that fast. Mikado: Good grief. I am not your pet cat. Mei: You're right. I'm sorry... Mikado: So, what happened after you captured the butterfly? Kousei: She seemed to brighten up considerably. Kousei: And I'm positive that change was due to the influence of Hiuchidani-san's power. Kousei: But assuming we were right about her being lovestruck, she'll most likely become depressed again if she's dumped, so we may have to monitor her situation again if that happens. Kanna: You're sure she didn't notice you two at all? Mei: No. We never got close to her, so I don't think she could've noticed us. Mikado: Even if she had noticed you, I doubt the woman would have linked you to the improvement in her mood. Mikado: The important thing is that you managed to capture the butterfly. Now all that's left is for Mei to learn how to release it. Mei: I'll try my best! Kanna: Just remember to practice only when we're around, and not on your own. Kanna: If you were to accidentally release your butterflies by mistake, there's no telling what effect it could have on the people around you. Mei: Got it! Mikado: You've done well. Make sure you get plenty of rest tonight. Mei: I will! Thank you! Kanna: Have a good night, you two. Kousei: Good night. Mei: Hey, Senpai! You wanna stop by someplace with me? Kousei: I was about to suggest the same thing. You want to go see how that woman's doing, right? Mei: Ahaha. I'm just curious. Mei: I have the feeling she won't be at the store, but it wouldn't hurt to take a look. Kousei: Yeah. Mei: Alright! Let's go. Mei: Hmm... Looks like I was right. Kousei: Guess she isn't here. Mei: She's probably out somewhere with her crush right now. Kousei: Maybe. Probably not here at the mall, though. Mei: Ahaha. Yeah. Who would want to go on a date where they work? Mei: But even if they were here, we wouldn't be able to spot them with how many people there are. Kousei: True. Nothing but Christmas couples as far as the eye can see. Mei: ...... Kousei: Hm? Mei: N-Nothing. It's just... you're a guy and I'm a girl, so... Mei: Other people might think we're a couple too, and that's a little embarrassing... Kousei: You don't want to be seen with me? Ouch... Mei: N-No, that's not what I meant! Kousei: I'm kidding, I'm kidding. You really aren't good with romance and stuff, are you? Mei: I-I'm just not used to it, I guess... Mei: ...... Mei: Say, Senpai... What do you think of me? Kousei: Huh? Wh-Wh-What do you mean? Mei: W-Wait, that came out wrong! I don't mean it like THAT! Mei: I mean, what do you think of me as a person? What kind of impression do you have of me? Kousei: O-Oh, uh, let me think... Mei: Do you think I'm rude, or difficult to approach? Kousei: Oh, no. I've never thought of you as that. Mei: Really? Kousei: Really. If anything, you're the opposite. I've always thought you were very cheery and easy to talk to. Mei: Ah... Thank goodness. I guess I'm doing a good job then... Kousei: What do you mean? Mei: ...... Mei: This might be a little off topic, but... Kousei: I'm listening. Mei: I once told my mom and dad about my eye too. Mei: But they seemed to think I was joking, so they just laughed it off. Mei: Even when I started growing out my bangs, they thought I was just going through my... what'cha call it... my edgy phase? Mei: That's when I realized I wasn't normal, and they didn't understand me. Mei: Ever since then, I stopped talking to people. Mei: It might be a bit dramatic to say I was traumatized by the experience... Mei: But in a way, I sort of was. It's always there, in the back of my mind. Mei: The frustration of not being understood. Mei: The burden of having to hide who I really am. Mei: I know I'm not normal. The truth is, I'm constantly afraid that I'll never fit in with those around me. Kousei: What do you mean? If anything, you're always the center of attention. Kousei: Out of all of us, you're undoubtedly the best at handling customers. Everyone at the cafe relies on you. Mei: Ahaha. Thank you. I appreciate it. Mei: You know, I wish I could work at the cafe forever. Mei: It makes me incredibly happy to know that I finally met other people who completely understand me. Mei: I've never cared much about the Christmas holidays, honestly... Mei: I might not have a boyfriend to spend it with, but at least I got to spend it with people who understand me. Mei: So thank you, Senpai. Mei: Thank you for paying attention to me. Kousei: I'm, er... glad I could help you be yourself. Mei: Absolutely! Kousei: Don't sweat it. I've got a bit of an unusual situation of my own, actually. Kousei: I understand how it feels, not being normal. Mei: You do? Kousei: There's a bit of a problem with my soul, you see. And I'm looking for a way to fix it. Mei: Is there anything I can do to help? Kousei: Well... Mei: Oh. Well, let me know if there's ever anything I can do to help! Kousei: I will. Thanks. Mei: Hey, I've got an idea! Like, this is way off topic, but just hear me out. Kousei: Hm? Mei: Let's go get another smoothie! Kousei: Sure. Guess that's sort of our tradition now, every time we come here. Mei: Ahaha! I guess so! But let me pay for you this time! Kousei: Nah, you don't have to. Mei: Nuh-uh, I am. I still haven't paid you back for helping me study for my mid-terms. Kousei: Seeing your grades go up was reward enough for me. Mei: Nice try, but I'm paying for you, whether you like it or not! Mei: Now come on, let's go! Kousei: Alright, alright. "

        "rag_prompt": "As the character Akizuki or Kanna, please consider the following examples of responses that have been generated based on the dataset: \n\n**Previous Examples:** Suzune: Crud. Looks like I'm all out of beer. Mei: Would you like some tea? I haven't drunk directly out of this one yet. Suzune: Sure. By the way, these kelp rolls are delicious. Mei: Hehe. I'll be sure to let my grandma know. Have as many as you want! Suzune: Hey, Kousei! Is it ready yet? I'm already getting full from all these kelp rolls! Kousei: Sorry for the wait. I just finished now. Mei: But you added some kind of smoked ingredient, didn't you? Kousei: You'll see. Go ahead and try it. Suzune: Uh-huh. Mei: ...... Suzune: ...... Mei: Oh? Suzune: Something tastes different. It's a lot more fragrant when I bite into it. Mei: It can't be the bacon, right? Where's this smoky flavor coming from? Suzune: It doesn't seem to be the vegetables, either... What exactly did you do? Kousei: It's the black pepper. That's what I smoked. Mei: Ohh! It's the seasoning! Kousei: Yeah. In a way, black pepper is actually the main ingredient in carbonara. That's where the name of the dish comes from, in fact. Suzune: It's derived from the Italian word for charcoal burner, right? Because there's supposed to be so much pepper on it that it turns black. Kousei: Exactly. I was contemplating whether or not to smoke the salt, but I thought that would change the flavor too much. Kousei: So I decided to smoke the pepper instead. This way it adds a nice kick without destroying the balance of the dish. Suzune: You're right. It really does add a nice kick. It's amazing how a small addition can make such a big difference. Suzune: Even though the seasoning is fundamentally the same, the flavor has a lot more depth. Mei: This is amazing! Just like authentic carbonara! Not that I know what authentic carbonara tastes like, but still! Kousei: Glad you like it. I only just finished smoking the pepper, so the smell might be a little harsh-- Kousei: But as long as I let it sit for a while, it should disappear. Then all I need to do is mix it with some regular black pepper to fine tune the flavor. Suzune: Sounds good. It could use a bit of adjusting, but I definitely think this is good enough to serve to our customers. In all honesty, this really is delicious. Kousei: Thanks. What about you-- Mei: Phew! That was good! Kousei: Wow. Not even a crumb left. Mei: It was too good! Just like real Italian cuisine! Not that I know what real Italian cuisine tastes like, but still! Suzune: You already said that earlier. I get what you're trying to say, though. Kousei: Ahaha... I wasn't expecting this much of a reaction. I'm flattered. Mei: Seriously, it was delicious! You're a genius, Senpai! Kousei: O-Oh stop it... Suzune: Well, since Mei-san is showering you in praise, I'm going to be a little more critical. Suzune: Like you said before, the dish still needs some balancing. Kousei: I know. It's got a pretty strong flavor, so I'm gonna try letting it mellow overnight next time. Suzune: Instead of trying to figure out everything on your own, though, you should ask the others at the cafe to taste-test your dish first. Suzune: Then you can decide if you want to tone it down, or if you actually want to emphasize that distinct flavor. Mei: Ohh, I see! The more unique it tastes, the more likely it is to grab people's interest! Suzune: Exactly. But you might get differing opinions on which one is better, which'll make it harder to decide. Suzune: Still, it's up to you. At the very least, I don't think anyone's going to object to you adding this dish to our menu. Kousei: Alright. I'll give it a shot. Kousei: And thanks, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Huh? Kousei: I wouldn't have come up with this idea without you, so thanks. Mei: Please! All I did was suggest the first thing that came to mind. Mei: Don't underestimate your own genius, Senpai! This really is amazing! Kousei: Th-Thanks. Suzune: Ahem. Kousei: Wh-What? Suzune: We're all out of cheese and sausages, so I'm gonna need you to make me some more. Kousei: You already ate them all? I wanted some too, you know. Suzune: Oh, stop griping. C'mon! Kousei: Alright, alright. Fine. Mei: Senpai! I want to try smoking some other things too! Kousei: Sure. I'll rummage around my fridge and see what else we can toss in the smoker. Mei: This is gonna be great! Kanna: Here's to another great year! Let's all do our best! Suzune: Alrighty. Ready to get back to work? Kousei: Yes, ma'am. Kousei: Not so much changed as added a new twist. I tried smoking the pepper first. Natsume: I can't say it looks or smells particularly different, though... Kousei: You'll see once you try it. Nozomi: Well, I'm gonna go ahead and dig in! Nozomi: That faint hint of smokiness... It's amazing how much difference it makes. Natsume: You said you smoked it yourself? Kousei: Yep. It was all Hiuchidani-san's idea. Mei: Don't be silly. You came up with the idea to smoke the black pepper. Mei: All I did was suggest that we try to make our own bacon. Natsume: Ah. So you spent the break thinking up ways to improve our menu... Natsume: That's very commendable of you. I'm impressed. Kousei: Thanks. How do you think it tastes? Kanna: I, for one, think it's delicious. It gives the dish a lot more added depth. Nozomi: I think so too. This seems like it'd be a real crowd-pleaser. Natsume: It certainly is delicious, but... Kousei: But? Natsume: I feel like the pepper's unique smokiness has a sort of... mature taste to it. Natsume: It's definitely not bad by any means, but--and this is just my personal opinion... Natsume: But I think I actually prefer the regular carbonara. Natsume: So while I'm all for adding this to our menu, I don't think it should replace the original version. Nozomi: You said you added the smoked black pepper to the pasta at the end, right? Kousei: Yeah, I did. Nozomi: In that case, why don't we just serve our regular carbonara with a shaker of smoked black pepper on the side? Nozomi: That way, customers can add as much or as little as they want. Natsume: How would we know how much to prepare in advance, though? Some customers might use a lot more than others. Suzune: A lot of beef bowl restaurants used to do the same thing with their special shichimi spices, but they had to stop the practice a little while back. Suzune: Some customers were using unbelievable amounts of spice, which ended up hurting their profits. Nozomi: Oh... I guess that won't work then. Kanna: It seems like our safest option would be to add this smoked pepper version as a separate item on the menu. Kousei: Alright. So I have all the judges' approval? Kanna: Absolutely. I think this would make a fine addition to our menu. Nozomi: Me too. Natsume: Me three. Kanna: What do you think, Mikado-san? Mikado: I believe Natsume mentioned earlier that this dish had a rather mature taste. However, many of our customers also come here specifically for our coffee and tea. Mikado: Judging from what I have gathered, this would suit their preferences well. Mikado: Therefore, I am in agreement. Kousei: Thank goodness... Mei: Way to go, Senpai! Kousei: Thanks! Kousei: I was just gonna do it at home, actually... Mikado: Among other problems, that would be quite expensive. I would not recommend you do that. Kousei: I guess that's true. Mikado: I do have some other ideas you may wish to consider. Are you free to talk after this? Kousei: Sure. I've got time. Kanna: In that case, let's call it a day here. See you tomorrow, everyone. Natsume: See you tomorrow. Nozomi: See you tomorrow! Kousei: Phew... Kousei: Huh? Hiuchidani-san? Mei: Hey. Kousei: What are you still doing here? Mei: I was waiting for you to finish. Kousei: You could've waited inside. Mei: Ahaha. I didn't want to bother you guys. Mei: Anyway, I know I should've said something earlier... but would you mind walking me home? Kousei: Sure. I don't mind. Let's go. Mei: Thanks! Mei: Congratulations on getting your new recipe approved, by the way. Kousei: Well, you helped with that. Mei: Not at all. You did this on your own, Senpai. Kousei: Nah, it's all thanks to you. I would've never come up with this idea on my own. Kousei: Seriously, thank you. I'm really grateful. Kousei: This might sound kind of melodramatic... but I think I've gained a little more confidence in myself now. Mei: Ehehe... You're gonna make me blush. I don't mean to sound melodramatic either, but, like... Mei: You've done a lot for me as well, Senpai. Ever since you've helped me open up about my left eye, I feel like a huge weight's been lifted off my shoulders. Mei: That's why I wanted to be able to return the favor if I could. Mei: I'm glad I managed to be of some small help to you. Kousei: It wasn't small at all. You were a big help. Kousei: I was hoping to do something like this before I had to deal with my exams, so I'm glad it all went so well. Mei: Oh, your exams are coming up? Kousei: At the end of the month, yeah. Mei: Does that mean you're gonna be working fewer hours? Kousei: No, I'll be working the same as usual. I'll do fine as long as I pay attention in class. Kousei: And I can always study after work too. Mei: You're a pretty diligent student, aren't you? Kousei: I don't know about that... I'm just the sort of guy who hates procrastinating. Mei: That's what it means to be diligent, Senpai. I think that's something to be proud of. Kousei: Nah, trust me... I can be pretty lazy when I want. Mei: But in front of me, at least, you're always hardworking and dependable. Kousei: Okay, sheesh. Stop flattering me. It's gonna go to my head. Mei: Ahaha! Alright. Mei: Well, good night, Senpai. Kousei: Good night. And sorry you had to wait for me earlier. Mei: That's okay. I waited because I wanted to congratulate you. Mei: Anyway, see you tomorrow! Kousei: Yeah. See you tomorrow. Mei: ...... Mei: Hmm... Exams... , Mei: Phew. I thought I was running late, but it looks like you arrived at the same time as me. Kousei: Yeah, I just got out of class. Kousei: Shiki-san and Nozomi should already be here, so let's head inside. Mei: Okay. Mei: Good morning! Kanna: Welcome, you two. Mei: It's a little weird being greeted with a \"Welcome\" when the cafe's closed. Kanna: Then by that logic, saying \"Good morning\" is weird too, no? We're not working. Mei: I guess that's true. Kanna: You're here to study for your exams, right? Natsume-san and Nozomi-san are already here. Kousei: Yeah, sorry. Nozomi: It's fine. You two were in class. Natsume: You don't have to apologize. It's no big deal to us. Kanna: What would everyone like to drink? I'll prepare some refreshments. Nozomi: Huh? But... Kanna: It's no trouble at all. If it'll help you focus on your studies, I'd be happy to help. Nozomi: That's really nice of you. In that case, I'll have a cup of Earl Grey. Mei: Can I get a glass of orange juice? Kanna: Sure. Kanna: What about you two? Natsume: I'll have an Earl Grey too. Kousei: I'll have a coffee. Kanna: Alright. Kousei: Let's get to it then. Did you manage to find the stuff I asked for? Natsume: Here. These were the only ones I had left. Kousei: Thanks. These should help. Natsume: We might be in different majors, but you managed to get into Hitotsuboshi too, so you had to have gotten high grades yourself. Kousei: Well, I had a lot of help, as I'm sure you can imagine. Plus, my grades were only just barely good enough to be accepted. Nozomi: Urgh. These tests are crazy. I can't even figure out this last question with the answer in front of me. Mei: I'm getting a headache just looking at it. Kousei: Yeah, there are quite a few nasty questions in here. Natsume: You can thank my teacher, Saeki-sensei, for that. Apparently, he was a huge math buff. Natsume: Rumor had it he made these questions specifically to be solved using applied mathematics, just to show students the beauty of mathmatics. Nozomi: I'm going to go out on a limb and say he didn't succeed. Natsume: Yeah, most of us couldn't stand his class. Not that we hated him, per se; he was a fine person, just his tests were awful. Mei: That's what I hear too. Kousei: This teacher still teaches there? Mei: Yeah, he sure does. Kousei: Well, these tests should be great reference material then. Kousei: As for the English ones, all these questions seem pretty standard. Natsume: At least when I was there, the only subject that had insanely difficult questions was math. Kousei: Good. Then as long as we use these tests and the textbook to review, you should be able to avoid failing. Natsume: Sounds like a lot of rote memorization, though. Kousei: It'll have to do, for now. There's not enough time for her to re-learn all the material. Mei: Thank you very much. Nozomi: At the moment, I guess I'm struggling with Natsume-san's math questions the most. Nozomi: An in-depth explanation would really help. Natsume: Alright. I'll walk you both through it, so listen up. Nozomi: Okay! Mei: I'm all ears. Mei: Thank you! Nozomi: Sorry for the trouble. And thanks. Natsume: Thank you for doing this, Akizuki-san. Natsume: So anyway--if I apply this formula here, using the value I calculated above, that should give me the answer. Does that make sense? Nozomi: Ahh, I see. Now that you explain it like that, I sort of understand... Maybe... Maybe not? Mei: You're amazing, Nozomi-chan. I still don't get it at all! Natsume: Well, that's no surprise. You're learning from scratch. Natsume: I'll try to explain it as simply as I can, okay? But let me know right away if there's something you don't understand. Mei: Okaaay... *sigh*... Kousei: You're sighing way too much. Natsume: If you're not having any trouble with what I just explained, Sumizome-san, you can go ahead and start studying something else. Nozomi: Well, I wouldn't say I fully understand it yet. Nozomi: Alright, though. Can I borrow your English test? I want to use it to study. Natsume: Be my guest. Mei: Sorry I'm delaying us, Nozomi-san. Nozomi: Hey, it's not a big deal. Nozomi: The whole reason we're having this study session is to learn! Nozomi: So let's work hard and do our best to pass, okay? Mei: Yeah! Kanna: And here's your coffee, Takamine-san. Kousei: Oh, thanks. Kanna: By the way, what are you doing? Kousei: I'm putting together a list of stuff I want to cover. Kanna: Oh, okay. Preparing your teaching materials. Would you like me to help? Kousei: You'd be willing? Kanna: Don't worry. I can at least help you organize everything. Kanna: Everyone's studying their hardest. I want to chip in to help too. Kousei: Alright. Grab a seat. Kanna: Thank you. Nozomi: Kousei-kun, can I ask you something? Kousei: What's up? Nozomi: How come the answer to this one is number two? The other choices sound like they make sense too. Kousei: Hm? Let me see. Ah. Well, if you look at the paragraph before the blank, you can tell whether it's a factual or hypothetical statement. Kousei: The question is asking about something that happened in the past, so the answer has to be number two. Number one is a conjunction, so that wouldn't make sense. See? There's a comma here. Nozomi: Oh, you're right! Urk... Why didn't I catch that? Kousei: It's an easy mistake to make. This whole section can be a little tricky. Kousei: But it's something you need to know. You'll find these sorts of questions on the English proficiency test as well. Nozomi: Really? Alright, thanks. I'd better study it some more then. Kanna: You're actually quite smart, aren't you, Takamine-san? Nozomi: You wouldn't think it, would you? We've known each other for ages, and he always helps me study for tests, but even I still can't believe it sometimes. Nozomi: I never see him cramming at home, so I have no idea how his grades are so good. Kousei: Hey, I put in the effort just like everybody else. Kanna: Is that true? Kousei: The most efficient way to retain information is to pay attention in class. That, and taking notes. Kousei: If I do that, a single glance is all it takes to remember what I learned, which also helps me cut down on review time. Kanna: More haste, less speed, as they say. Nozomi: He's been saying that stuff for years. But if it was that easy to pay attention in class, we wouldn't be asking for help in the first place. Nozomi: Ugh, I can't do this. My concentration is shot. Mei: Me too. It feels like my brain is about to burn out... *sputter* *sputter*... Natsume: Oh, it's getting quite late. Alright. Let's call it a day. Mei: *siiigh* Thank you very much... Nozomi: Thank you! Natsume: You're welcome. So what do you think? Feeling a little more confident now? Mei: Uhh, yeah. I think I understand a bit more now... sort of. Natsume: Ah. Well, I'm glad my explanations made sense to you. Mei: I'll try reviewing everything again once I get home. Natsume: If there's anything you don't understand, let me know. Natsume: Even if it's something we've gone over already, don't be embarrassed. It happens sometimes. Mei: Okay. Thank you for your help. Kousei: Why don't we get you to take the same tests Shiki-san lent us tomorrow? Kousei: After you review the questions you get wrong, you can retake them again the next day. Natsume: I think that's a good idea too. Mei: But, like, won't I just be solving the same questions over and over? Natsume: There's nothing wrong with that. The worst thing would be for you to only think you understand. Kousei: Yeah, the goal here is to make sure you comprehend what you're learning. Kousei: If you can get the same grades Shiki-san did, you should be able to pass your exams without a hitch. But simply memorizing her answers won't mean anything. Mei: Yes, I know. Kousei: Are you okay with that too, Nozomi? Nozomi: Sounds good to me. Natsume: Starting tomorrow, I want you to come in to the cafe even on your days off. Kousei: We'll be able to help you study if you use the break room. Though it'll have to be while we're on the job. Mei: Alright. Thank you kindly. Kanna: Also, take these. I made copies of all your English and Japanese history study materials. Nozomi: Thank you so much! Kousei: Japanese history will largely be pure memorization, but for English, make sure you think about your answers carefully and review them. Mei: I will. Kousei: And thanks for helping out too, Akizuki-san. Kanna: Not at all. Helping people in need is also a part of my job now. Mei: Thanks for everything today. Natsume: Don't thank us just yet. Thank us once you've passed your exams. Mei: True. Alright then! I'll do my best! Nozomi: I'm hooome. Rokurou: Welcome back, Nozomi. Rokurou: Pretty late today, aren't you? I thought you didn't have work on Wednesdays. Nozomi: I was studying with a friend today. Kousei-kun and one of my coworkers were helping us prepare for our mid-terms. Nozomi: I wasn't playing around, so relax. Rokurou: That's not really what I'm worried about... Rokurou: I'm glad to see you working so hard, but make sure you don't overdo it. Rokurou: You've been staying up rather late these days, haven't you? Pulling all-nighters isn't good for your health. Nozomi: I know, geez. That's why I'm doing this now, so I don't have to stay up all night. Nozomi: Anyway, I'm going back to my room to do a bit more review. Rokurou: Don't you want to take a bath? Nozomi: Later. Nozomi: ...... Nozomi: ...... Nozomi: ... Nozomi: Nh... Ngh! Ahh, it's already this late? Nozomi: *sigh*... I studied a whole, whole lot. I've never been able to do this much on my own before. Nozomi: I'd better go take a bath now. If I don't get some sleep soon, I won't be able to wake up on time tomorrow. , Mei: Ah, Senpai! Kousei: Hey. You know, I just realized something after seeing your outfit. Mei: What's that? Kousei: You're on winter break. Mei: Ahaha! Seriously? Why do you think we're meeting up this early in the day? Kousei: True. For some reason, I guess I assumed you'd want to put all this off until after the holidays. Mei: I don't want school getting in the way. Plus, Suzune-san says we're going to be ridiculously busy on Christmas. Kousei: You're working on Christmas? Mei: Yep. I specifically asked to. Kousei: You aren't doing anything with your friends? Mei: Ahaha... Well, they've all got boyfriends, so... Kousei: Ah. Not too surprising then. Mei: You're working Christmas too, aren't you? And Christmas Eve as well, if I recall. Kousei: Yeah. I don't have any plans either, so I figured I might as well. Mei: Sad being single, isn't it? Kousei: Yeah... Mei: Well, not exactly. I recognize her, but I doubt she recognizes me. Mei: Yep. I thought I recognized her from somewhere, so I came here yesterday to double-check. And I was right. Kousei: Didn't take us long to find her, did it? Come to think of it, this is where you and I found out about Yuina's dad too. Mei: Hey, you're right! Maybe this is a lucky place. Kousei: Maybe. Or maybe it's you. Mei: Huh? Me? Kousei: It almost feels like you have a knack for running into people with butterflies or something. Mei: I'm not really sure how to feel about that. Kousei: Sorry. Just a thought. Kousei: Me neither. Mei: Weird. Maybe she isn't the same person? Kousei: Or maybe she already solved her own issues before we could intervene? Mei: I wonder... Hm? Wait, wh-what? Kousei: I see it. Mei: I've never seen anyone's wisps appear and disappear like that. Kousei: What do you mean? Mei: Ah. The guy's back. Kousei: ...... Mei: ...... Kousei: The butterfly's flying away. Mei: You're right. I... can't see the wisp anymore. Kousei: Hmm... Mei: Maybe that man has powers too. Powers like mine. Kousei: The power to repel butterflies, instead of attracting them? It's possible, I guess... Mei: Ah. We probably look really suspicious right now, don't we? Kousei: Huh? Oh, right. Why don't we go over there? Kousei: Hmm. Let's try giving Akizuki-san a call first. Kousei: This could be an unusual case, so we don't want to act rashly. Mei: Okay. Good point! Kanna: Hello? Kousei: This is Takamine. Kanna: Do you need something? Kanna: You said the butterfly disappears whenever this coworker of hers is nearby, correct? Kousei: Yeah. And whenever he leaves, the butterfly comes back. Kousei: Hiuchidani-san thought that maybe the man had some kind of power to repel butterflies... Kanna: *sigh* I didn't think you two were THIS obtuse... Kousei: Come again? Kanna: She's obviously lovestruck. Kousei: What? Sh-She's in love? Kanna: She is. If I had to guess, I'd say that this woman is secretly in love with her coworker. Kousei: She has a crush on him? Wait, really? That's why she's attracting butterflies? Kanna: Hey, don't be so dismissive of the power of love. Kanna: It has the power to incite our deepest, darkest passions. Love inflames the soul, for better or for worse. Kanna: And I would daresay that love is what's thrown that woman's emotions into turmoil. Kanna: She feels happy when they're together, but depressed when they're apart. Kanna: That would explain why the butterfly comes and goes like that. Kousei: I... guess? Kanna: She's probably agonizing over whether or not to confess her feelings to him. Kanna: But if she continues to remain under the butterfly's influence, she may lose hope and decide to give up on him altogether. Kousei: So we should use Hiuchidani-san's powers to capture her butterfly to prevent that from happening? Kanna: To be honest, I'm not entirely sure. If she ends up being rejected anyway, she may become even MORE susceptible to the butterfly's influence. Kanna: I'll leave it up to you to decide what to do, though. And again, please try not to draw unnecessary attention to yourselves. Kousei: I know. Thanks for the help, Akizuki-san. Kousei: Yeah. Apparently, the woman's in love with her coworker, and that's why her emotions are so unstable. Mei: Ohh... Sh-She's in love... That was why! Mei: Th-This feels, like, really embarrassing to say, even though she's a complete stranger... Kousei: It's almost Christmas too. She might be thinking about confessing to him tomorrow or the day after. Mei: Wh-What? Mei: Ngh... Ahh! Kousei: Y-You okay? Mei: I-I'm sorry. I'm just, um, not really used to talking about these sorts of things... Mei: It's getting me a little too worked up... Kousei: Want me to go get you something to drink? Mei: N-No, I'm fine... Kousei: Right. Whenever she's together with him, her spirits temporarily lift, which is why the wisp disappears. Kousei: But when they're apart, she goes back to feeling anxious, which is when the wisp returns. Kousei: Or at least, that's what Akizuki-san's theory is. Mei: Hrmm... Mei: ...... Mei: What if... Kousei: Hm? Mei: What if we do nothing and just let things run their course? Mei: Her wisp already goes away on its own from time to time without me having to make it disappear. Mei: I'm not sure I should be interfering... Kousei: Well... I suppose Akizuki-san DID say the situation wasn't urgent. Kousei: Trust me, you'd know if it was. There'd be a lot more butterflies. Kousei: That woman only has one or two around her at most, so she isn't terribly affected by them. At least, for now. Kousei: Even if we do nothing, it's possible that she'll overcome their influence on her own and confess her feelings. Kousei: But that said, we could still be way off mark. It may have nothing to do with love. Mei: Oh, true... There could be something else that's troubling her. Kousei: From Mikado's point of view, her personal problems aren't really our concern. The important thing is that we catch the butterfly. Mei: Yeah. That's their job, after all. Mei: Then I guess this was our only choice from the start... Mei: It's done. Kousei: Wow. Mei: Huh? Kousei: That was incredible. Beautiful, even. Mei: W-Was it? I can't really tell, myself... Kousei: It definitely looks like she has. Mei: I hope it goes well... Kousei: That's up to her. All we can do is pray that it does. Mei: Yeah. Kousei: If she gets rejected, though... Mei: Hey, don't say that, Senpai. You're gonna jinx it! Kousei: M-My bad. Kousei: Anyway, we've done all we can. The rest is out of our hands. Mei: Alrighty. Mission complete! Kousei: Yep. Not that I actually did anything. Mei: Ahaha! You phoned for help. That counts plenty, I think. Kousei: It'd feel weird to just go home now... Why don't we grab a drink or something? Mei: Good idea! I also want to see if anything happens between those two. Kousei: In that case, how about we get-- Mei: Let's get smoothies! Kousei: Thought you'd say that. Mei: Thanks for paying for me again. Kousei: No problem. It can be your reward for catching the butterfly. Mei: Hehe. You're the best. Mei: By the way, I heard that we're going to be helping bake cakes tomorrow. Kousei: Oh, right. Apparently we received a lot more orders than we expected, so we need all hands on deck. Kousei: Suzune-san wants everyone to pitch in and help. Mei: My shift doesn't start till the afternoon, though. Will I even make it in time to help? Kousei: Suzune-san says we'll be baking them so they're ready just in time for customers to pick up. Kousei: So don't worry. There's gonna be plenty of work to go around. Mei: Alrighty! I don't know if I'll be any good at baking, though... Kousei: You'll probably be put in charge of sales. Mei: Oh, right. I guess we can't have everyone making cakes. Mei: Sounds like it's gonna be a pretty tough day tomorrow. Let's get through this together! Kousei: It'll definitely be busy, but at least we'll get to spend the holidays together with everyone at the cafe. Mei: Ahaha! True that. Mei: Oh, Senpai! Look! Kousei: And it must've gone well. Mei: Yeah! I'm so happy for her. Mei: A Christmas date with her crush... How nice. Kousei: Too bad the only date we have is our jobs. Mei: Urk... Talk about depressing... Kousei: Well, you ready to get going? Mei: Sure. Kousei: We can tell Akizuki-san what happened tomorrow. It's gonna be a busy day, so we should get home early and rest up. Mei: Oh, well I wouldn't mind going to tell her right now, actually! Kousei: You just want to play with Mikado some more, don't you? Mei: Urk... How'd you know? Kousei: It was written all over your face. Mei: Ngh... Can you blame me?! His amazing fluffiness is enough to make anyone go crazy! Mei: Ah. I can be a little too candid sometimes, can't I? I'm sorry. I'll try to be more careful. Kousei: Eh, I don't mind. Feel free to be yourself. I'd prefer that, actually. Mei: Really? Well, please forgive me if I start acting too friendly. Ehehe. Mei: Welp, let's go on home! Kousei: Sounds like a plan. Mei: Let's work real hard tomorrow! Kousei: O-Okay... Kanna: Yes... Nozomi: I-I'll try to hang in there... Kanna: Still, it's not all bad. We wouldn't have gotten such a flood of orders if people didn't love your cakes. Nozomi: Even at my school, there are a ton of kids who are fans of your baking. Suzune: Well, I am a professional. Can't go losing to other restaurants in terms of quality. Suzune: Though... I do apologize for biting off more than I could chew. I knew I should've put a limit on the number of orders. Kousei: But it wasn't an impossible amount. We're nearly there. Kanna: Yeah. Let's hang in there just a little bit longer! Nozomi: Okay! Suzune: You can say that again. I'm exhausted... Natsume: I thought selling cakes would be easier than baking them... Boy, was I wrong. Kousei: I never stepped out of the kitchen today, but there must've been a crazy number of customers. Mei: You wouldn't believe it. We somehow managed to pull through with the three of us, but we could barely keep up. Natsume: Even without counting the people who were here to pick up advance orders, there were a ton of customers who came to buy our regular cakes too... Mei: But even those were flying off the shelves. Natsume: Yeah. I know you guys tried to restock them as fast as you could, but even then they would sell out almost instantly. Suzune: That's probably what I regret the most. Shouldn't have prioritized the advance orders so much. Mikado: Now I understand where the phrase \"selling like hotcakes\" comes from. It's incredible the effect the Christmas holidays have on sales. Kousei: Coming from someone on the kitchen side, you don't know the half of it. Suzune: I mean, they say sales typically go up tenfold on Christmas Eve. Cake stores everywhere are working overtime. Nozomi: Even though Christmas itself is tomorrow, it almost feels like we had more advance orders for today. Suzune: Yep. Christmas Eve is usually the peak in terms of sales. But make no mistake, we'll still be plenty busy tomorrow as well. Natsume: It's an excellent business opportunity, for sure. That said, I'm kind of worried that we're working you too hard, Suzune-san. Suzune: I could say the same for the rest of you. We've gotta strike while the iron's hot, though, so let's keep it up for one more day. Kanna: Agreed. Let's all get a good night's rest so we can be ready for tomorrow. Natsume: See you tomorrow, everyone. Mei & Nozomi: See you all tomorrow! Mei: Y-Yes. Mikado: Mei. Mei: Yes? Mikado: Why are you staring at me with those bloodshot eyes? Mei: I was, um... wondering if you could transform back into your-- Mikado: No. Mei: ...... Kanna: I've never seen anyone's spirits drop that fast. Mikado: Good grief. I am not your pet cat. Mei: You're right. I'm sorry... Mikado: So, what happened after you captured the butterfly? Kousei: She seemed to brighten up considerably. Kousei: And I'm positive that change was due to the influence of Hiuchidani-san's power. Kousei: But assuming we were right about her being lovestruck, she'll most likely become depressed again if she's dumped, so we may have to monitor her situation again if that happens. Kanna: You're sure she didn't notice you two at all? Mei: No. We never got close to her, so I don't think she could've noticed us. Mikado: Even if she had noticed you, I doubt the woman would have linked you to the improvement in her mood. Mikado: The important thing is that you managed to capture the butterfly. Now all that's left is for Mei to learn how to release it. Mei: I'll try my best! Kanna: Just remember to practice only when we're around, and not on your own. Kanna: If you were to accidentally release your butterflies by mistake, there's no telling what effect it could have on the people around you. Mei: Got it! Mikado: You've done well. Make sure you get plenty of rest tonight. Mei: I will! Thank you! Kanna: Have a good night, you two. Kousei: Good night. Mei: Hey, Senpai! You wanna stop by someplace with me? Kousei: I was about to suggest the same thing. You want to go see how that woman's doing, right? Mei: Ahaha. I'm just curious. Mei: I have the feeling she won't be at the store, but it wouldn't hurt to take a look. Kousei: Yeah. Mei: Alright! Let's go. Mei: Hmm... Looks like I was right. Kousei: Guess she isn't here. Mei: She's probably out somewhere with her crush right now. Kousei: Maybe. Probably not here at the mall, though. Mei: Ahaha. Yeah. Who would want to go on a date where they work? Mei: But even if they were here, we wouldn't be able to spot them with how many people there are. Kousei: True. Nothing but Christmas couples as far as the eye can see. Mei: ...... Kousei: Hm? Mei: N-Nothing. It's just... you're a guy and I'm a girl, so... Mei: Other people might think we're a couple too, and that's a little embarrassing... Kousei: You don't want to be seen with me? Ouch... Mei: N-No, that's not what I meant! Kousei: I'm kidding, I'm kidding. You really aren't good with romance and stuff, are you? Mei: I-I'm just not used to it, I guess... Mei: ...... Mei: Say, Senpai... What do you think of me? Kousei: Huh? Wh-Wh-What do you mean? Mei: W-Wait, that came out wrong! I don't mean it like THAT! Mei: I mean, what do you think of me as a person? What kind of impression do you have of me? Kousei: O-Oh, uh, let me think... Mei: Do you think I'm rude, or difficult to approach? Kousei: Oh, no. I've never thought of you as that. Mei: Really? Kousei: Really. If anything, you're the opposite. I've always thought you were very cheery and easy to talk to. Mei: Ah... Thank goodness. I guess I'm doing a good job then... Kousei: What do you mean? Mei: ...... Mei: This might be a little off topic, but... Kousei: I'm listening. Mei: I once told my mom and dad about my eye too. Mei: But they seemed to think I was joking, so they just laughed it off. Mei: Even when I started growing out my bangs, they thought I was just going through my... what'cha call it... my edgy phase? Mei: That's when I realized I wasn't normal, and they didn't understand me. Mei: Ever since then, I stopped talking to people. Mei: It might be a bit dramatic to say I was traumatized by the experience... Mei: But in a way, I sort of was. It's always there, in the back of my mind. Mei: The frustration of not being understood. Mei: The burden of having to hide who I really am. Mei: I know I'm not normal. The truth is, I'm constantly afraid that I'll never fit in with those around me. Kousei: What do you mean? If anything, you're always the center of attention. Kousei: Out of all of us, you're undoubtedly the best at handling customers. Everyone at the cafe relies on you. Mei: Ahaha. Thank you. I appreciate it. Mei: You know, I wish I could work at the cafe forever. Mei: It makes me incredibly happy to know that I finally met other people who completely understand me. Mei: I've never cared much about the Christmas holidays, honestly... Mei: I might not have a boyfriend to spend it with, but at least I got to spend it with people who understand me. Mei: So thank you, Senpai. Mei: Thank you for paying attention to me. Kousei: I'm, er... glad I could help you be yourself. Mei: Absolutely! Kousei: Don't sweat it. I've got a bit of an unusual situation of my own, actually. Kousei: I understand how it feels, not being normal. Mei: You do? Kousei: There's a bit of a problem with my soul, you see. And I'm looking for a way to fix it. Mei: Is there anything I can do to help? Kousei: Well... Mei: Oh. Well, let me know if there's ever anything I can do to help! Kousei: I will. Thanks. Mei: Hey, I've got an idea! Like, this is way off topic, but just hear me out. Kousei: Hm? Mei: Let's go get another smoothie! Kousei: Sure. Guess that's sort of our tradition now, every time we come here. Mei: Ahaha! I guess so! But let me pay for you this time! Kousei: Nah, you don't have to. Mei: Nuh-uh, I am. I still haven't paid you back for helping me study for my mid-terms. Kousei: Seeing your grades go up was reward enough for me. Mei: Nice try, but I'm paying for you, whether you like it or not! Mei: Now come on, let's go! Kousei: Alright, alright. \n\nWhile these examples may provide some guidance, evaluate their relevance to the current conversation.

Kousei: Hold on a minute. We have to take a picture first! Miyu: Aww... Kanna: Now, now. No frowning. Give me a big, wide smile. Kanna: If you don't, you know what's going to happen! Tickle, tickle, tickle! Miyu: Ahaha! Mommy, that tickles! Kanna: Come on, sweetie. Smile, smile! Miyu: I am smiling! Ahaha! Kousei: Look this way, Miyu. Kanna: Tickle, tickle, tickle! Miyu: Mooommy!

            "Kanna: I'm sorry. I should've done more prior research. Kousei: Still, it's nowhere near as busy as it was on Christmas. Kousei: And honestly, it's probably better that it's a little crowded. Kanna: Why do you say that? Kousei: Well, now we have a reason to stick to each other more closely. Kanna: That's a wonderful way of looking at it. Kanna: Me too. Nihihi. Kousei: So, where should we go first? Kanna: Hmm... Why don't we start by going where you want to? Kousei: Alright. The haunted house it is. Kanna: ...... Kanna: You bully. Kousei: Sorry. Just kidding. Kousei: Let's start with a thrill ride then. That okay with you? Kanna: Of course. Let's go. Kousei: Oh--but you should probably go to the bathroom first this time. Kanna: You really are a bully. Kousei: Don't worry. Even if you do pee your pants, I'll still love you. Kanna: And you have no tact either. Kousei: If anything, I might fall in love with you even more. Kanna: Not only that, but you're a huge pervert too! Kanna: Why on earth did I fall in love with this person again? Kousei: C'mon, it's just a light joke. You don't have to respond so seriously. It kinda hurts, you know. Kanna: It's hard to tell with you sometimes. Kousei: Whoaaaa! Kanna: The sunset looks beautiful too. Kousei: Yeah. It really is... Kousei: Nope. Just admiring how cute my girlfriend is. Kanna: ...... Kousei: I'm being serious, you know? Kanna: I know. It's embarrassing because you said it with such seriousness... Kanna: But thank you. I love you too. Kousei: You don't know how happy hearing that makes me. Kanna: I really appreciate you humoring my selfish wish today. Kousei: I don't think there's anything selfish about wanting to spend time with your boyfriend. Kanna: Keep that up, and I'm going to start saying things like \"What's more important, me or your job?\" Do you want that? Kousei: I mean, the answer is you, obviously. I don't care about work. Kousei: In fact, who even needs a job? I'm staying home all day! Leave the housework to me! Kanna: You're exactly the kind of person who'd say that. *giggle* Kanna: I must have seen countless sunsets before... but I don't think I've ever seen one this breathtaking. Kousei: Probably because you're seeing it together with someone you love, huh? Kanna: Yeah. You may be right. Kanna: Ever since we started spending time together, I've been having so much fun each and every day. Kousei: Th-Thanks... Although it's a little embarrassing hearing you admit it so readily. Kanna: Well, it's the truth. Kanna: Even when I can't see you, you're all I think about. Even when we do get to see each other, but things don't go as planned... it never stops being fun. Kanna: Every day, I think about what I want to talk to you about next, what I want to do together next-- Kanna: For the first time in my life, I can't wait to see what tomorrow holds. Kousei: Me too. Before I sleep, I always think about you, or the next time I get to see you. Kanna: Thank you for not giving up on me when I tried to run away back then. Kanna: Thanks to you, I discovered what true happiness feels like. Kousei: ...... Kanna: Now that I've experienced this feeling of bliss, I'm hopelessly addicted. Kanna: Even once I'm reincarnated, I'm sure I'll find happiness again. I plan on spending each day like today, looking forward to the next. I'm certain of it. Kanna: So please don't forget, Kousei-san. Kousei: How could I ever forget the girl who turned down my first ever confession? Kanna: There you go, rubbing salt in the wound again... Kanna: But it's not me myself that I don't want you to forget about... Kousei: I know. Kousei: There's no way I'd forget how amazing our first kiss was either. I can't really explain it well, but it was just... amazing. Kanna: That's not what I meant either, and you know it. Kousei: What? Are you saying that kiss meant nothing to you? Kanna: Of course not... It felt amazing for me too. More amazing than words can describe. Kousei: Right? Kanna: I'm so happy right now. Kousei: Me too. Kanna: But you haven't forgotten what you promised me, have you? Kousei: No. I remember. Kanna: Will you be able to keep your promise? Kousei: I'm not a kid. Of course I will. Kanna: I'm holding you to it. You'd better not forget. Kousei: I won't. Kanna: I want you to find your own happiness, for real this time. Kousei: What do you mean \"for real\"? I'm already happy right now. Kanna: I guess so. Nihihi. Kanna: ...... Kanna: You know something, Kousei-san? Kousei: Yeah? Kanna: I really love you. Kousei: I love you too, Kanna. Kousei: I love you. Kousei: I love you... Kousei: ...... Mikado: Kanna has departed now, I take it? Kousei: Yeah. I thought I'd come to tell you... but I guess you already knew. Mikado: Yes. I have known her for quite a long time, after all. Mikado: And she had already requested that I find another employee to fill in for her after her departure. Kousei: Ah. Kousei: ...... Kousei: I know this might be a bit late, but can I ask you something? Mikado: What? Kousei: Do you think I managed to make her happy? Kousei: Was she happy enough to overcome her past? Mikado: Well, you certainly made her happy enough to squeal with joy. In fact, she would not shut up about you. Mikado: At the very least, those were her true feelings. That much I can confirm. Kousei: Alright. Kousei: I know. Mikado: If fate permits it, however... you may end up meeting each other once again. Kousei: I can meet her again? Like, in the future? Mikado: Indeed. However, since she is going to be reborn, she will certainly end up younger than you... Kousei: ...... Mikado: It may even be possible for her to be reincarnated as your own daughter one day. Mikado: If that happens, I trust that you will shower her with love and make her happy. Kousei: My daughter? You're kidding... Kousei: I can't even begin to imagine that. Mikado: Quite understandable. Kousei: Well, anyway, that's all I came here to tell you. Mikado: Thank you. I appreciate it. Mikado: At any rate, you ought to rest for today. It will help to calm you down. Kousei: You say that... but I'm not sure it will. Mikado: I understand that it is hard, but still. Mikado: Like I said, this was for the sake of Kanna's happiness. You will simply have to accept that. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Brr... It's freezing. Kousei: ...... ",
            "Mikado: Is not about the carbonara, no. I shall leave that matter completely up to you. Kousei: Alright. I'll try preparing a few more dishes next week as an experiment. Maybe up the order limit to twenty-five. Kanna: Sounds good. Anyway, I'm sure you can guess why I've asked you two to stay behind. Mei: This is about my eye again, isn't it? Kanna: We just want to know how things are progressing, so this shouldn't take too much of your time. Has anything changed with your eye since we last spoke? Mei: No. I still don't know how to release my butterflies... Kanna: Not to worry. I'm certain you'll get there eventually. Mikado: Our main purpose in opening this cafe has always been to collect butterflies. Thanks to you, that task has been proceeding expeditiously. Mikado: Allow me to thank you for your hard work once again. We owe you our gratitude. Mei: A-All I'm doing is catching butterflies. I'd wouldn't exactly call that \"hard work\"... Mei: B-But either way, I'll continue to do my best to help! Mikado: Thank you. We appreciate it. Mei: ...... Mikado: But while I appreciate your efforts, I will not be transforming into a cat. Mei: Okay. I'm sorry. Kanna: Allow me to thank you as well, Takamine-san. Kousei: Huh? Why me? Kanna: While it was mere coincidence that brought you here to work with us, you've become an invaluable member of our team. Kanna: Many of our customers even come to our cafe specifically to eat your dishes now. Kanna: So thank you very much. You've been an incredible help to us all. Kousei: Well, I mean... this was all because of that \"problem\" I had with my soul in the first place... Kousei: But I'm glad you appreciate me. Honestly, this job has been pretty fulfilling for me too lately. Mikado: Indeed. It would appear your soul's condition has been greatly improving. Kanna: You can't let your guard down just yet, but as long as you keep heading in the right direction, you won't have anything to worry about. Kousei: Phew. That's a relief to hear. I owe it all to Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Huh? Kousei: Thanks for guiding me in the right direction. Mei: N-No, I didn't do anything. Kousei: You did. Thank you for everything. Mei: I-I... Mei: ...... Mei: U-Um, was there anything else you wanted to discuss? Kanna: No, I believe that's it. Mei: In that case, I've got something I need to do, so--! Mikado: Alright. Then we apologize for keeping you. Mei: That's okay! Anyway, I'll be going now! Kousei: Let me walk you-- Mei: Good night! Kousei: Huh? Kousei: Y-Yeah, I am... Kanna: Good night. Kousei: Yeah. Good night... Kousei: ...... Kousei: I should've known... Mei: Y-You're fine. Kousei: Freaking out? Mei: Y-Yeah... I... Um... Mei: ...... Mei: Oh, gosh... I'm so nervous... Mei: U-Umm... I think it would take too long to explain myself, so... h-here! Mei: Yes. It's... my Valentine's Day gift... to you. Kousei: Chocolate! Mei: Y-Yes. It's chocolate, and it's, um... handmade. Kousei: Handmade! Mei: Wow, you're really excited about this... Suzune-san taught me how to make it, so it should taste alright... I think. Kousei: Oh... Is that why you've been going home together lately? Mei: Yeah. I've been going to her apartment so she could teach me. Mei: She's also been helping me by asking you about your preferences and stuff... Kousei: My preferences? Oh, wait. Mei: Ahaha... Sorry. I guess I just felt kind of embarrassed... Kousei: Is that why the others said they weren't giving me any chocolate this year? So this would be a surprise? Mei: What? I don't know anything about that... Mei: But the others knew I was planning on giving you my own chocolate, so... I guess that could be why they did that... Kousei: Phew. I thought for sure you hated me or something... Mei: Wh-What?! Of course not! Why would you think that? Kousei: I mean, you've been avoiding me lately, haven't you? Mei: I-I wasn't... I mean... Well, maybe a little... Kousei: See? Mei: That's only because I didn't want you to find out I was preparing chocolate for you... Mei: But... I'm sorry for acting so weird. I didn't mean to give you the wrong idea. Kousei: It's alright. I've been really anxious these past few days, so it's a relief to know the truth. Mei: Urk... I'm sorry... Kousei: Handmade chocolate, though... This is more than I expected. Thank you. Mei: Um, if you'd like... you're welcome to go ahead and eat it... Kousei: Right now? Mei: Yeah. I actually brought you a fork too. Kousei: To be honest, I was planning to go home and savor it there... Mei: N-No, please! You can't! You can't keep me waiting that long! Mei: My heart's already pounding so fast it's about to explode! Mei: I need to know how you think it tastes right now... or else I'm going to die! Kousei: A-Alright. I'll have a bite... Mei: Please do! There are two inside, so at least try one of them! Right now! Mei: Something like that. It's called a chocolate fondant. Kousei: Sounds fancy. Was it hard to make? Mei: Not at all. Suzune-san was there to guide me through every single step. Mei: Ah, but just for the record--I made this all by myself! And I think I did a pretty good job! Mei: Though, um... it was a lot crispier on the outside when it came out of the oven, but it might be a bit soggy by now. Mei: But it shouldn't taste bad! This was Suzune-san's own personal recipe! I baked it with the utmost care! Mei: The flavor should be to your liking as well! So p-please, go ahead and try some! Kousei: Alright... don't mind if I do then. Mei: H-Help yourself! Kousei: ...... Mei: H-Hello? Kousei: ...... Mei: Senpai? Kousei: ...... Mei: Um... Does it... taste bad? Kousei: It's delicious. Mei: R-Really? Oh, thank goodness! Kousei: Oh god... It's so delicious... Mei: Wait, what? Huh? Kousei: How? How can something taste THIS good?! Mei: O-Oh, come on... You're exaggerating... Kousei: *sniffle*... Mei: Wait, are you crying? You're not pretending, are you? No way. Like, seriously? You're seriously crying? Kousei: I can't help it... Mei: O-Okay? Kousei: Everyone kept saying they wouldn't be giving me any chocolate... Mei: Oh... right. They said it'd be a hassle to get return gifts for everyone. Kousei: Even Nozomi, who usually gives me chocolates every year... gave me nothing. Mei: Wait, every year? Oh, right. You and Nozomi-chan are childhood friends. Kousei: Yeah, but she said she'd only been giving them to me out of force of habit... Mei: Oh... Err... I'm not sure what to say to that. Kousei: In the end, the only person who gave me chocolates was you... And handmade chocolate too... Kousei: Thank you... Thank you, Hiuchidani-san! Mei: I didn't think you'd be THIS emotional... but I'm glad you like it. Mei: But I can't say I was expecting you to start crying... It's a little, um, creepy. Kousei: Yeah, I know. I guess I tried too hard to sell it. Mei: Ah! I KNEW you were pretending, you stinker! Mei: Do you really mean that? Kousei: Yeah. I mean it. Seriously. Kousei: I could finish off both these chocolates right here if I'm not careful. Mei: Phew... Kousei: There's no way you could've gone wrong with Suzune-san's recipe. Mei: Yeah, but still... Kousei: Besides, even if it DID taste bad, I'd never say it to your face. Mei: What? So it really DOES taste bad?! Kousei: No, no. It's delicious. Really. Mei: *sigh*... My heart's pounding so much. Like, I've been feeling so anxious lately. That's why I've been acting so weird... Mei: When I was making the chocolate by hand, I began to understand how you feel, Senpai. Mei: Making food for someone else to eat is incredibly stressful and nerve-wracking... Mei: But it's also really fun, trying to make something that the person will like. Mei: And when you do get that confirmation from them that they like it... Mei: It makes you happier than words can describe! Kousei: I already told you. Why don't you believe me? Mei: Because I'm worried! Kousei: Didn't you taste it yourself beforehand? Mei: Well, yeah. I tried one I made from the same batch, but still... Kousei: It was delicious, wasn't it? Mei: It was, but this one's gone all cold! It's not FRESH! Kousei: Even so, it tastes delicious. Mei: Really? Really, really? Kousei: If you're really that worried about the taste, why don't you try some yourself? Kousei: See? I told you. Mei: Phew... Wait. Ah... Ahh! Kousei: What? Mei: Th-Th-Th-That was... an i-i-indirect k-ki--! Kousei: Oh, right. Sorry. You're pretty sensitive about these sorts of things, aren't you? Mei: O-O-Oh, no! It doesn't bothe--well... i-it does, I guess... Kousei: My bad. I totally forgot. Mei: I-I mean... As long as it's you, I... Mei: ...... Mei: U-U-Umm! Kousei: Hm? Mei: Suzune-san told me something... Kousei: Yeah? Mei: She said that you'd be happy receiving any kind of chocolate for Valentine's Day... Kousei: It's true. I'm pretty thrilled right now. Thank you, seriously. Mei: You're welcome... But she also said that... if I gave you handmade chocolate... Mei: Then... Umm... Kousei: Hm? Mei: Then you'd... umm! Kousei: Yeah? Mei: You'd think that... it meant I had genuine feelings for you... Kousei: O-Oh, come on! I can't believe she told you that too! Mei: Y-Yes... That's what she said... Kousei: I, er, I mean... I was only half-joking when I said that... Mei: You were... joking? Kousei: Y-Yeah. I was just messing with her... Kousei: B-But don't worry! I'm not dumb enough to think you like me just because of a couple chocolates! Mei: ...... Mei: I wouldn't mind... if you thought I did... though. Kousei: O-Okay? Kousei: ...... Kousei: Wait, what?! Mei: ...... Kousei: ...... Kousei: ...... Mei: Um... Mei: ...... Mei: During our girls' night out the other day... everyone kept asking me about that time we went to the pool together... Mei: Eventually, the conversation turned to... whether or not I had f-feelings for you, Senpai... Mei: I said I didn't know... but everyone else said it was obvious that I did... Mei: I thought they might be right... but I've never had any sort of romantic experience before... so I wasn't sure. Mei: I can't say I really understand my own feelings... but at the very least, I do know that you're a very important person to me. Mei: That's... what I wanted to tell you today. Mei: But... Mei: ...... Mei: Just now, I realized that... I really do... love you, Senpai. Mei: I mean, love is supposed to make your heart pound, isn't it? But when I'm with you, it's almost the opposite... I feel so relaxed that I thought it couldn't be love. Mei: But right now... my heart is pounding like crazy. Even though all I'm doing is telling you how I feel... my chest feels like it's about to burst. Mei: When I made up my mind to give you these chocolates... and when I decided to ask Suzune-san to teach me how to make them... Mei: While I practiced... This morning... During work... And while I was sitting here waiting for you earlier too... Mei: My heart wouldn't stop pounding. Mei: You wouldn't believe how nervous I felt. Mei: The truth is... I've had feelings for you all this time. Mei: So it's time I worked up the courage to say it. Mei: I... I think I love you, Senpai. Mei: No, wait... That doesn't sound right... Mei: ...... Mei: Senpai... I love you. Mei: I love the way you thank me, even when I've barely done anything... Mei: I love the way you're so nice to me, and lend an ear to all my worries... Mei: And I love so many other things about you too. Mei: So please... Mei: ...... Mei: Please... go out with me. Mei: Please... take me as your girlfriend. Mei: I... want to be with you from now on, Senpai. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Right now... my heart's also hammering like crazy. Kousei: When I thought you were avoiding me... it made me feel so lonely and so worried. Kousei: I was afraid you didn't like me, and I became really depressed. Kousei: Especially when you ran off without giving me any chocolate. Kousei: But then--you messaged to ask if we could meet. My heart wouldn't stop pounding on the way here. Kousei: This whole day's been a roller coaster of emotions for me. Kousei: But if what I'm feeling is the same thing you are... then I'm in love too. Kousei: In love with you, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Ah... Urk... Kousei: I love you too, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: S-So... Kousei: I want you to go out with me. Mei: ...... Mei: Ahhh... Mei: I'm a total mess of emotions right now... Kousei: Me too... My face must be burning up right now. Mei: ...... Kousei: ...... Mei: ...... Kousei: Uh... if you don't mind... Mei: Huh? Kousei: Could I call you by your first name? It'd feel oddly formal... if I kept using your last name. Mei: Y-Yeah, I agree... Go ahead. You don't have to use an honorific either... if you don't want. Kousei: Oh... Mei: Yeah. You can just call me Mei. Kousei: M... M-M-M... Mei: You're stammering so much... Kousei: I-I can't help it. I've never called you this before... Mei: That's fine. I can be patient. Kousei: M-Mei... Mei: There you go. Ehehe... Kousei: What about you? Mei: Huh? Kousei: Will you start calling me by my name? Mei: Senpai? Kousei: That's not what it says on my birth certificate. Mei: Urk... Mei: ...... Mei: Kousei... san? Kousei: You can drop the honorific too. Mei: Well... I mean, I'm younger than you, so... Mei: But maybe I could call you Kou-kun instead-- Mei: No, wait. That's even more embarrassing. Kousei: Yeah... That's pretty embarrassing for me too. Mei: Well, for now... I'm only going to use your first name when we're alone together. Kousei: A-Alright. I guess we wouldn't want the others to tease us about it. Mei: E-Exactly. Kousei: ...... Mei: ...... Kousei: Y-Yeah. I mean, if that's okay with you... Mei: O-Of course it is! Mei: ...... Mei: Finally... I'm your girlfriend! "

I wanna eat cake! And I wanna eat omelet rice too! Kanna: Alright. Once we get to the cafe, I'll make it for you. Miyu: Yay! Can we go to the cafe right now then? Kousei: Hold on a minute. We have to take a picture first! Miyu: Aww... Kanna: Now, now. No frowning. Give me a big, wide smile. Kanna: If you don't, you know what's going to happen! Tickle, tickle, tickle! Miyu: Ahaha! Mommy, that tickles! Kanna: Come on, sweetie. Smile, smile! Miyu: I am smiling! Ahaha! Kousei: Look this way, Miyu. Kanna: Tickle, tickle, tickle! Miyu: Mooommy! I said it tickles! Kanna: Come on, look at the camera. Kousei: Happy birthday, Miyu. Kanna: Happy birthday! Miyu: Thanks! Ehehe. , Kanna: I'm sorry. I should've done more prior research. Kousei: Still, it's nowhere near as busy as it was on Christmas. Kousei: And honestly, it's probably better that it's a little crowded. Kanna: Why do you say that? Kousei: Well, now we have a reason to stick to each other more closely. Kanna: That's a wonderful way of looking at it. Kanna: Me too. Nihihi. Kousei: So, where should we go first? Kanna: Hmm... Why don't we start by going where you want to? Kousei: Alright. The haunted house it is. Kanna: ...... Kanna: You bully. Kousei: Sorry. Just kidding. Kousei: Let's start with a thrill ride then. That okay with you? Kanna: Of course. Let's go. Kousei: Oh--but you should probably go to the bathroom first this time. Kanna: You really are a bully. Kousei: Don't worry. Even if you do pee your pants, I'll still love you. Kanna: And you have no tact either. Kousei: If anything, I might fall in love with you even more. Kanna: Not only that, but you're a huge pervert too! Kanna: Why on earth did I fall in love with this person again? Kousei: C'mon, it's just a light joke. You don't have to respond so seriously. It kinda hurts, you know. Kanna: It's hard to tell with you sometimes. Kousei: Whoaaaa! Kanna: The sunset looks beautiful too. Kousei: Yeah. It really is... Kousei: Nope. Just admiring how cute my girlfriend is. Kanna: ...... Kousei: I'm being serious, you know? Kanna: I know. It's embarrassing because you said it with such seriousness... Kanna: But thank you. I love you too. Kousei: You don't know how happy hearing that makes me. Kanna: I really appreciate you humoring my selfish wish today. Kousei: I don't think there's anything selfish about wanting to spend time with your boyfriend. Kanna: Keep that up, and I'm going to start saying things like \"What's more important, me or your job?\" Do you want that? Kousei: I mean, the answer is you, obviously. I don't care about work. Kousei: In fact, who even needs a job? I'm staying home all day! Leave the housework to me! Kanna: You're exactly the kind of person who'd say that. *giggle* Kanna: I must have seen countless sunsets before... but I don't think I've ever seen one this breathtaking. Kousei: Probably because you're seeing it together with someone you love, huh? Kanna: Yeah. You may be right. Kanna: Ever since we started spending time together, I've been having so much fun each and every day. Kousei: Th-Thanks... Although it's a little embarrassing hearing you admit it so readily. Kanna: Well, it's the truth. Kanna: Even when I can't see you, you're all I think about. Even when we do get to see each other, but things don't go as planned... it never stops being fun. Kanna: Every day, I think about what I want to talk to you about next, what I want to do together next-- Kanna: For the first time in my life, I can't wait to see what tomorrow holds. Kousei: Me too. Before I sleep, I always think about you, or the next time I get to see you. Kanna: Thank you for not giving up on me when I tried to run away back then. Kanna: Thanks to you, I discovered what true happiness feels like. Kousei: ...... Kanna: Now that I've experienced this feeling of bliss, I'm hopelessly addicted. Kanna: Even once I'm reincarnated, I'm sure I'll find happiness again. I plan on spending each day like today, looking forward to the next. I'm certain of it. Kanna: So please don't forget, Kousei-san. Kousei: How could I ever forget the girl who turned down my first ever confession? Kanna: There you go, rubbing salt in the wound again... Kanna: But it's not me myself that I don't want you to forget about... Kousei: I know. Kousei: There's no way I'd forget how amazing our first kiss was either. I can't really explain it well, but it was just... amazing. Kanna: That's not what I meant either, and you know it. Kousei: What? Are you saying that kiss meant nothing to you? Kanna: Of course not... It felt amazing for me too. More amazing than words can describe. Kousei: Right? Kanna: I'm so happy right now. Kousei: Me too. Kanna: But you haven't forgotten what you promised me, have you? Kousei: No. I remember. Kanna: Will you be able to keep your promise? Kousei: I'm not a kid. Of course I will. Kanna: I'm holding you to it. You'd better not forget. Kousei: I won't. Kanna: I want you to find your own happiness, for real this time. Kousei: What do you mean \"for real\"? I'm already happy right now. Kanna: I guess so. Nihihi. Kanna: ...... Kanna: You know something, Kousei-san? Kousei: Yeah? Kanna: I really love you. Kousei: I love you too, Kanna. Kousei: I love you. Kousei: I love you... Kousei: ...... Mikado: Kanna has departed now, I take it? Kousei: Yeah. I thought I'd come to tell you... but I guess you already knew. Mikado: Yes. I have known her for quite a long time, after all. Mikado: And she had already requested that I find another employee to fill in for her after her departure. Kousei: Ah. Kousei: ...... Kousei: I know this might be a bit late, but can I ask you something? Mikado: What? Kousei: Do you think I managed to make her happy? Kousei: Was she happy enough to overcome her past? Mikado: Well, you certainly made her happy enough to squeal with joy. In fact, she would not shut up about you. Mikado: At the very least, those were her true feelings. That much I can confirm. Kousei: Alright. Kousei: I know. Mikado: If fate permits it, however... you may end up meeting each other once again. Kousei: I can meet her again? Like, in the future? Mikado: Indeed. However, since she is going to be reborn, she will certainly end up younger than you... Kousei: ...... Mikado: It may even be possible for her to be reincarnated as your own daughter one day. Mikado: If that happens, I trust that you will shower her with love and make her happy. Kousei: My daughter? You're kidding... Kousei: I can't even begin to imagine that. Mikado: Quite understandable. Kousei: Well, anyway, that's all I came here to tell you. Mikado: Thank you. I appreciate it. Mikado: At any rate, you ought to rest for today. It will help to calm you down. Kousei: You say that... but I'm not sure it will. Mikado: I understand that it is hard, but still. Mikado: Like I said, this was for the sake of Kanna's happiness. You will simply have to accept that. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Brr... It's freezing. Kousei: ...... , Mikado: Is not about the carbonara, no. I shall leave that matter completely up to you. Kousei: Alright. I'll try preparing a few more dishes next week as an experiment. Maybe up the order limit to twenty-five. Kanna: Sounds good. Anyway, I'm sure you can guess why I've asked you two to stay behind. Mei: This is about my eye again, isn't it? Kanna: We just want to know how things are progressing, so this shouldn't take too much of your time. Has anything changed with your eye since we last spoke? Mei: No. I still don't know how to release my butterflies... Kanna: Not to worry. I'm certain you'll get there eventually. Mikado: Our main purpose in opening this cafe has always been to collect butterflies. Thanks to you, that task has been proceeding expeditiously. Mikado: Allow me to thank you for your hard work once again. We owe you our gratitude. Mei: A-All I'm doing is catching butterflies. I'd wouldn't exactly call that \"hard work\"... Mei: B-But either way, I'll continue to do my best to help! Mikado: Thank you. We appreciate it. Mei: ...... Mikado: But while I appreciate your efforts, I will not be transforming into a cat. Mei: Okay. I'm sorry. Kanna: Allow me to thank you as well, Takamine-san. Kousei: Huh? Why me? Kanna: While it was mere coincidence that brought you here to work with us, you've become an invaluable member of our team. Kanna: Many of our customers even come to our cafe specifically to eat your dishes now. Kanna: So thank you very much. You've been an incredible help to us all. Kousei: Well, I mean... this was all because of that \"problem\" I had with my soul in the first place... Kousei: But I'm glad you appreciate me. Honestly, this job has been pretty fulfilling for me too lately. Mikado: Indeed. It would appear your soul's condition has been greatly improving. Kanna: You can't let your guard down just yet, but as long as you keep heading in the right direction, you won't have anything to worry about. Kousei: Phew. That's a relief to hear. I owe it all to Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Huh? Kousei: Thanks for guiding me in the right direction. Mei: N-No, I didn't do anything. Kousei: You did. Thank you for everything. Mei: I-I... Mei: ...... Mei: U-Um, was there anything else you wanted to discuss? Kanna: No, I believe that's it. Mei: In that case, I've got something I need to do, so--! Mikado: Alright. Then we apologize for keeping you. Mei: That's okay! Anyway, I'll be going now! Kousei: Let me walk you-- Mei: Good night! Kousei: Huh? Kousei: Y-Yeah, I am... Kanna: Good night. Kousei: Yeah. Good night... Kousei: ...... Kousei: I should've known... Mei: Y-You're fine. Kousei: Freaking out? Mei: Y-Yeah... I... Um... Mei: ...... Mei: Oh, gosh... I'm so nervous... Mei: U-Umm... I think it would take too long to explain myself, so... h-here! Mei: Yes. It's... my Valentine's Day gift... to you. Kousei: Chocolate! Mei: Y-Yes. It's chocolate, and it's, um... handmade. Kousei: Handmade! Mei: Wow, you're really excited about this... Suzune-san taught me how to make it, so it should taste alright... I think. Kousei: Oh... Is that why you've been going home together lately? Mei: Yeah. I've been going to her apartment so she could teach me. Mei: She's also been helping me by asking you about your preferences and stuff... Kousei: My preferences? Oh, wait. Mei: Ahaha... Sorry. I guess I just felt kind of embarrassed... Kousei: Is that why the others said they weren't giving me any chocolate this year? So this would be a surprise? Mei: What? I don't know anything about that... Mei: But the others knew I was planning on giving you my own chocolate, so... I guess that could be why they did that... Kousei: Phew. I thought for sure you hated me or something... Mei: Wh-What?! Of course not! Why would you think that? Kousei: I mean, you've been avoiding me lately, haven't you? Mei: I-I wasn't... I mean... Well, maybe a little... Kousei: See? Mei: That's only because I didn't want you to find out I was preparing chocolate for you... Mei: But... I'm sorry for acting so weird. I didn't mean to give you the wrong idea. Kousei: It's alright. I've been really anxious these past few days, so it's a relief to know the truth. Mei: Urk... I'm sorry... Kousei: Handmade chocolate, though... This is more than I expected. Thank you. Mei: Um, if you'd like... you're welcome to go ahead and eat it... Kousei: Right now? Mei: Yeah. I actually brought you a fork too. Kousei: To be honest, I was planning to go home and savor it there... Mei: N-No, please! You can't! You can't keep me waiting that long! Mei: My heart's already pounding so fast it's about to explode! Mei: I need to know how you think it tastes right now... or else I'm going to die! Kousei: A-Alright. I'll have a bite... Mei: Please do! There are two inside, so at least try one of them! Right now! Mei: Something like that. It's called a chocolate fondant. Kousei: Sounds fancy. Was it hard to make? Mei: Not at all. Suzune-san was there to guide me through every single step. Mei: Ah, but just for the record--I made this all by myself! And I think I did a pretty good job! Mei: Though, um... it was a lot crispier on the outside when it came out of the oven, but it might be a bit soggy by now. Mei: But it shouldn't taste bad! This was Suzune-san's own personal recipe! I baked it with the utmost care! Mei: The flavor should be to your liking as well! So p-please, go ahead and try some! Kousei: Alright... don't mind if I do then. Mei: H-Help yourself! Kousei: ...... Mei: H-Hello? Kousei: ...... Mei: Senpai? Kousei: ...... Mei: Um... Does it... taste bad? Kousei: It's delicious. Mei: R-Really? Oh, thank goodness! Kousei: Oh god... It's so delicious... Mei: Wait, what? Huh? Kousei: How? How can something taste THIS good?! Mei: O-Oh, come on... You're exaggerating... Kousei: *sniffle*... Mei: Wait, are you crying? You're not pretending, are you? No way. Like, seriously? You're seriously crying? Kousei: I can't help it... Mei: O-Okay? Kousei: Everyone kept saying they wouldn't be giving me any chocolate... Mei: Oh... right. They said it'd be a hassle to get return gifts for everyone. Kousei: Even Nozomi, who usually gives me chocolates every year... gave me nothing. Mei: Wait, every year? Oh, right. You and Nozomi-chan are childhood friends. Kousei: Yeah, but she said she'd only been giving them to me out of force of habit... Mei: Oh... Err... I'm not sure what to say to that. Kousei: In the end, the only person who gave me chocolates was you... And handmade chocolate too... Kousei: Thank you... Thank you, Hiuchidani-san! Mei: I didn't think you'd be THIS emotional... but I'm glad you like it. Mei: But I can't say I was expecting you to start crying... It's a little, um, creepy. Kousei: Yeah, I know. I guess I tried too hard to sell it. Mei: Ah! I KNEW you were pretending, you stinker! Mei: Do you really mean that? Kousei: Yeah. I mean it. Seriously. Kousei: I could finish off both these chocolates right here if I'm not careful. Mei: Phew... Kousei: There's no way you could've gone wrong with Suzune-san's recipe. Mei: Yeah, but still... Kousei: Besides, even if it DID taste bad, I'd never say it to your face. Mei: What? So it really DOES taste bad?! Kousei: No, no. It's delicious. Really. Mei: *sigh*... My heart's pounding so much. Like, I've been feeling so anxious lately. That's why I've been acting so weird... Mei: When I was making the chocolate by hand, I began to understand how you feel, Senpai. Mei: Making food for someone else to eat is incredibly stressful and nerve-wracking... Mei: But it's also really fun, trying to make something that the person will like. Mei: And when you do get that confirmation from them that they like it... Mei: It makes you happier than words can describe! Kousei: I already told you. Why don't you believe me? Mei: Because I'm worried! Kousei: Didn't you taste it yourself beforehand? Mei: Well, yeah. I tried one I made from the same batch, but still... Kousei: It was delicious, wasn't it? Mei: It was, but this one's gone all cold! It's not FRESH! Kousei: Even so, it tastes delicious. Mei: Really? Really, really? Kousei: If you're really that worried about the taste, why don't you try some yourself? Kousei: See? I told you. Mei: Phew... Wait. Ah... Ahh! Kousei: What? Mei: Th-Th-Th-That was... an i-i-indirect k-ki--! Kousei: Oh, right. Sorry. You're pretty sensitive about these sorts of things, aren't you? Mei: O-O-Oh, no! It doesn't bothe--well... i-it does, I guess... Kousei: My bad. I totally forgot. Mei: I-I mean... As long as it's you, I... Mei: ...... Mei: U-U-Umm! Kousei: Hm? Mei: Suzune-san told me something... Kousei: Yeah? Mei: She said that you'd be happy receiving any kind of chocolate for Valentine's Day... Kousei: It's true. I'm pretty thrilled right now. Thank you, seriously. Mei: You're welcome...

Kousei: Y-Yeah. I was just messing with her... Kousei: B-But don't worry! I'm not dumb enough to think you like me just because of a couple chocolates! Mei: ...... Mei: I wouldn't mind... if you thought I did... though. Kousei: O-Okay? Kousei: ...... Kousei: Wait, what?! Mei: ...... Kousei: ...... Kousei: ...... Mei: Um... Mei: ......

You can just call me Mei. Kousei: M... M-M-M... Mei: You're stammering so much... Kousei: I-I can't help it. I've never called you this before... Mei: That's fine. I can be patient. Kousei: M-Mei... Mei: There you go. Ehehe... Kousei: What about you? Mei: Huh? Kousei: Will you start calling me by my name? Mei: Senpai? Kousei: That's not what it says on my birth certificate. Mei: Urk...

That's even more embarrassing. Kousei: Yeah... That's pretty embarrassing for me too. Mei: Well, for now... I'm only going to use your first name when we're alone together. Kousei: A-Alright. I guess we wouldn't want the others to tease us about it. Mei: E-Exactly. Kousei: ...... Mei: ...... Kousei: Y-Yeah. I mean, if that's okay with you... Mei: O-Of course it is! Mei: ......

Kousei: Hold on a minute. We have to take a picture first! Miyu: Aww... Kanna: Now, now. No frowning. Give me a big, wide smile. Kanna: If you don't, you know what's going to happen! Tickle, tickle, tickle! Miyu: Ahaha! Mommy, that tickles! Kanna: Come on, sweetie. Smile, smile! Miyu: I am smiling! Ahaha! Kousei: Look this way, Miyu. Kanna: Tickle, tickle, tickle! Miyu: Mooommy! I said it tickles! Kanna: Come on, look at the camera. Kousei: Happy birthday, Miyu. Kanna: Happy birthday! Miyu: Thanks! Ehehe. ",
            "Kanna: Guatemalan coffee with a sachertorte, and a Darjeeling with pancakes. Alright. I'll have those out to you shortly. Kanna: I need a Guatemalan and Darjeeling for table four, as well as a slice of sachertorte. Natsume: Got it. Kanna: Order coming in! One plate of pancakes for table four, please. Kousei: Alright. Kousei: The carbonara for table two is ready, by the way. Kanna: I'll take that out. Kousei: You too. Kousei: What's degenerate about that? Every healthy young man has those kinds of thoughts. Kanna: I question that. Your fetishes are definitely not normal. Kousei: Well, I'm sorry that your thighs are just that enticing. Take it as a compliment. Kanna: That's not a very flattering compliment. Kousei: O-Oh. Well then. Kousei: You don't have to do that... but could you keep on stroking my head? Kanna: Like this? Nihihi. You really are a needy little boy, aren't you? Kousei: ...... Kousei: Kanna, if I may. Kanna: What is it? Kousei: I know I'm the one who asked you to stroke my head... but do you have to do it like that? Kanna: Well, shucks... I thought you'd appreciate that. Kanna: In that case... how about I tickle you this time instead? Coochy, coochy, coo! Kousei: Ah, hey, stop that! I'm ticklish! Kanna: That's good to know! Nihihi! Kousei: Ahhh?! Ah! Fine, let's see how YOU like it! Kanna: Ah! Ah, ahh! Ah, ah! Nhhhh! Kousei: Nh, nhh... Kanna: Ahh! *pant*... Kousei: Y-Yeah. Kousei: I'll see you tomorrow. Kanna: See you tomorrow. Kanna: ...... Kanna: Hnghh! Mikado: Is something the matter? Kanna: No, it's nothing serious. You want to know something, though, Mikado-san? Mikado: What? Kanna: Kisses feels amazing. Mikado: I beg your pardon? Kanna: You know, kissing. I had no idea it would make me feel so hot. Even though it's not my first time anymore... it's sho amazing... Mikado: You had me quite confused at first. Well, I am glad that your relationship seems to be going well... Mikado: But how were things? Kanna: It's strange. Even though all we're doing is putting our lips together... it makes my entire body go numb, making it hard to even breathe, plus my head goes completely blank-- Mikado: I was not asking you to describe your impressions of kissing. Kanna: Wait! I know what you're thinking, but we didn't use any tongue! That would virtually be foreplay, and we haven't had sex yet, so-- Mikado: I was not inquiring about any of that, you nymphomanic excuse of a Grim Reaper. Kanna: You really need to stop calling me that. Mikado: I was merely asking you how Takamine Kousei was doing. Mikado: But I think I have heard all I need to hear. Mikado: Given how giddy you yourself are, it is clear as day how Takamine Kousei must be feeling. Kanna: Ahaha... Is it that obvious? Mikado: If he truly does make you that happy, is that not all the more reason to go all the way with him? Kanna: I mean, sure... I bet it feels wonderful... having sex with someone you truly love. Kanna: At least, I'm sure it would for me. Mikado: But not for him? Kanna: I'm afraid. If I were to be his first, and then disappear soon after... Mikado: ...... Kanna: Oh, that reminds me. You should start looking for a new employee. Kanna: After the New Year's holiday, we're going to be one waitress short. Mikado: Ah... So the time you have remaining is that scant? Kanna: Yes. I want to make him happy, make him smile. But at the same time... I don't want him to have a lingering attachment to me that becomes a burden to him. Kanna: That's why the most I could give him was an ordinary kiss. Kanna: Truth be told, it may have been better if we never even did that. Kanna: But I really do love him, so I just couldn't help myself... Mikado: That was a part of it, I'm sure. Mikado: But you allowed him to kiss you because you saw no problem with it, did you not? Kanna: Yes. I hadn't realized it myself, but now that you mention it... you're probably right. Kanna: I'm certain that Kousei-san will be fine. Mikado: If you can say that with such confidence, then you have nothing to worry about. Mikado: Should you choose to keep him at arm's length... you may well end up leaving him with even more regrets. Kanna: I appreciate your advice. Mikado: I look forward to seeing you all next year. Have a good night, everyone. Mikado: Make sure not to catch a cold under the kotatsu tonight. Everyone: Happy New Year! Mei: What are you doing for the New Year's holiday, Nozomi-chan? Nozomi: Helping out at home, most likely. It's the busiest time of the year for us at the shrine. Mei: Oh, that's right! I'll definitely come by to visit the shrine for New Year's. I can't wait to see your adorable shrine maiden outfit! Nozomi: Oh, stop. You're embarrassing me... Natsume: Have you got any special plans, Suzune-san? Suzune: Nope. I think I'm just gonna hibernate at home till January. Kousei: Hm? Aren't you going to get changed? Kanna: I can always get changed in my own room. But first, I wanted to ask you about your holiday plans. Kousei: Sure. I wanted to ask you what you were doing too. Kousei: How do Grim Reapers usually spend their New Year's? Do you have to drop by heaven and say hello to God or something? Kanna: No, nothing like that. Kanna: Actually, I was hoping I could spend it with you. What do you say we go on another date tomorrow? Kanna: There's someplace I'd like to go. Kousei: Fine by me. In fact, I'd love to. Kousei: Where are we going? Kanna: That's... a secret for now. Kousei: It's a surprise, huh? Kanna: More or less. Kanna: Let's meet at noon here, at the cafe... Oh, and make sure you don't eat lunch beforehand. Kousei: Alright. Noon it is. Kanna: Indeed. Kousei: I can't wait to see what you have in store for tomorrow. Kanna: ...... Kanna: You bet. I'll see you tomorrow. ",
            "Natsume: Hey. Mei: How's Kousei-senpai doing? Kanna: He seemed fine. He had a decent appetite, and his temperature was normal too. Suzune: Phew. That's good to hear. Kanna: Thank you for lending me your key, Nozomi-san. Nozomi: You're welcome. I was feeling pretty worried myself; Kousei-kun rarely gets so sick that he has to stay at home. Mei: Really? Nozomi: He always seems relatively healthy, doesn't he? Nozomi: As far back as I can remember, he's never come down with anything worse than a light cold. His immune system must be pretty strong. Suzune: Hmm. So I guess even people like him aren't invincible? Kanna: It is winter, after all. Perhaps he let his guard down a little too much. Kanna: But I'm sure he'll be fit as a fiddle by tomorrow. Mikado: Well then, now that our worries have been laid to rest, let us get back to cleaning up. Nozomi & Mei: Okaay. Mikado: So. Mikado: How was Takamine Kousei truly doing? Kanna: As we feared, his soul had weakened considerably. Mikado: I assume you treated him accordingly? Kanna: Yes, of course. In order to return his weakened soul to normal, I poured my energy into-- Kanna: I mean, that is to say... Kanna: ...... Kanna: I did what had to be done. Mikado: That is quite the vague way of putting it. Kanna: Pay me no mind. Mikado: ...... Mikado: Come to think of it, I believe that you have to physically touch someone in order to transfer your energy to them. Kanna: Yes... that you do. Mikado: And furthermore, it cannot be a simple holding of the hands. It has to be a more intimate method of contact, if I recall. Kanna: ...... Mikado: Did you have sexual intercourse with him, by chance? Kanna: Of course not! Where on earth did that come from?! Mikado: You were acting quite odd, so I thought perhaps that was why... Kanna: Excuse you? What, did you think that instead of pouring my energy into him, he poured his essence into ME?! Kanna: You're so vulgar, Mikado-san. Mikado: That is simply your own filthy mind clouding your judgment, you nymphomanic excuse of a Grim Reaper. Kanna: Please never call me that ever again. Mikado: Still, something happened, no? You have a terrible poker face when it comes to hiding your own secrets. Kanna: Nothing happened. I just... put my forehead against his. Mikado: Hmm. Nothing too strange, I suppose. Kanna: The idea seemed fine to me at first, since it's something a parent might do for their child... Kanna: But once I actually did it, I started feeling incredibly embarrassed for some reason... and my heart began pounding like crazy... Kanna: Then I started babbling nonsense, shouting sex this, sex that. Mikado: Now you have lost me. Kanna: (Maybe it's because I did something I've never experienced before. Something I wasn't used to...) Kanna: (Maybe that's why it makes my heart race just thinking back on it.) Kanna: (In fact... Ever since I met Takamine-san, I've been feeling my heart race quite often.) Kanna: (But it goes beyond just that.) Kanna: (We've also had lots of fun chatting about silly things, phone shopping, eating yakiniku with everyone, and taking lots of pictures.) Kanna: (Enjoyable memories that don't just make my heart race, but also bring a smile to my face.) Kanna: (When did I begin to actively want to do those things with others...) Kanna: (And whenever the thought crosses my mind--) Kanna: (I naturally picture Takamine-san there as well.) Mikado: ...... Kanna: Oh! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to get lost in thought. Mikado: In any case, is it safe to say that the matter with Takamine Kousei's weakened soul has been resolved? Kanna: Yes. I believe he should be up and about by tomorrow. Mikado: And what about you? Are you... Mikado: ...... Mikado: Never mind. Forget it. Mikado: At any rate, even assuming Takamine Kousei feels well enough to return to work tomorrow, I suggest you keep a close eye on him. Kanna: Tomorrow... Mikado: Is something the matter? Kanna: No, it's nothing. Kanna: (Is it... normal that I can't wait to see him back at work tomorrow?) Kousei: Hmm? Child: Forgive me... I'm sorry, I'm sorry... Kousei: What a weird dream, though. Kousei: Why are you whispering like you're filming a prank video? Nozomi: Huh? You're already awake, Kousei-kun? How are you feeling? Kousei: I feel fine. Great, even. Kousei: What are you doing here so early, though? Nozomi: I came to see how you were doing, duh. Kousei: I appreciate the concern, but I'm all better now. Couldn't be better, in fact. Nozomi: Are you planning to go to work today? Kousei: Yep. With the way I'm feeling, I shouldn't need to play it safe. Nozomi: Hmm... Let me see. Nozomi: I've got some breakfast prepared for you, so why don't we eat together? You are hungry, aren't you? Kousei: Absolutely. But if you're only gonna start cooking now, I might end up late for work. Nozomi: Worry not, Kousei-kun. It's just last night's leftovers. Nozomi: I was worried you might not have an appetite, so I packed everything into these Tupperware containers in case you needed to keep them in the fridge for a while. Kousei: Man, you're the perfect girl, Nozomi. Nozomi: Ehehe! Your praise is greatly appreciated. Nozomi: Oh, that reminds me. I'm sure everybody's worried about you, so let them know you're back on your feet, okay? Kousei: Good idea. Suzune: Mhh, tastes fine. Thanks. Kousei: Alright. I'll get to work on the next batch. Kanna: Good morning, you guys! Kousei: Ah! Suzune: Hey there, Kanna-san. Kousei: O-Oh, uh... hi, Akizuki-san. Kanna: Having naughty thoughts first thing in the morning again, are we? My goodness. Nihihi! Kanna: (Calm down, Kanna! Just calm down! Do not panic!) Kanna: (If Takamine-san sees me like this, he's going to get the wrong idea.) Kanna: (I'm a Grim Reaper. It would cause nothing but trouble if I were to lead him on like that... Alright.) Kanna: Ahem. Good morning, Takamine-san. Kousei: Yeah. Good morning. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Huh? O-Oh. Sorry. Kanna: Takamine-san... You weren't having any weird fantasies again, were you? Kousei: Hahaha. Don't be ridiculous. Kanna: You're acting awfully suspicious. Kousei: I mean, can you blame me after what we did yesterday? Kousei: Easier said than done... Kousei: The more you tell me not to worry about it, the harder it is to actually do. Kanna: I understand that, but still... Kousei: ...... Kanna: ...... Suzune: *stare* Kousei: Er... Could you please stop staring at us? Suzune: Stop making me out to be the bad guy here. Suzune: Something happen yesterday between you two? You mentioned feeling awkward. Suzune: Don't tell me that \"visit\" was just an excuse for you two to get it on or something? Kanna: We did nothing of the sort! I only went to check up on him! It was just a normal visit!  Kousei: What?! THAT was normal for you? It was my first time... *blush*... Kanna: Don't test me! Kousei: Sorry, sorry. Bad joke. Kousei: Anyway, it's not what you're thinking. All she did was cook me omelet rice. Kousei: But enough about that. Let's get back to work. We've gotta hurry or we won't make in time for opening. Suzune: Well, whatever. As long as it doesn't impact your work. Kanna: I'd better start getting the dining floor ready too. Kanna: By the way, Takamine-san. Would you come see me later when you have some time? There's something I'd like to check with you. Kousei: Alright, sure... Suzune: Hmm... I'm not sure you'll have the time. You need to get to class soon, don't you? Kousei: Oh, right. I didn't realize the time. Suzune: Go on. Get outta here before you're late. Kousei: Alright. Just let me finish up here before I leave. Kousei: Okay. Let's get going. Kanna: Takamine-san? Thank goodness I caught you before you left. Kousei: Are you taking a break? Or is there some kind of problem? Kanna: Did you forget what I told you this morning? I wanted to check something with you. Kousei: Oh, right... Sorry. I was so focused on work that I totally forgot. Kousei: You want to check on my soul, right? Kanna: Yes. I want make sure everything's okay, just to be safe. Kousei: So, uh... are we gonna do the forehead thing again? Kanna: Yes... we are. Otherwise I won't be able to tell. Kanna: But don't worry. I won't make a fool of myself like yesterday. I've calmed down a bit since last night, so I promise not to go shouting about sex and whatnot again. Kanna: I can't guarantee I won't get embarrassed, though... Kousei: Well, as long as you're fine with it, I don't mind. Kousei: In fact, this is my life and health we're talking about here. I should be begging you to do it. Kousei: Thanks. And sorry for making you deal with my problems all the time. Kanna: Oh, don't worry about that. It has always been my job to look after your well-being, after all... And besides, I'm rather enjoying myself. Kousei: You are? Kanna: Yeah. It's kind of like... all this time, I've done nothing except guiding the souls of the dead, performing my duties as a Grim Reaper. Kanna: Not to say I dislike my job as Grim Reaper, though. I think it's a very important responsibility. Kousei: Ah... I guess I understand where you're coming from. Kanna: Not to mention phone shopping, eating yakiniku, and taking pictures of everyday things. Kanna: But all of it has been incredibly fun. Kanna: So please, don't hesitate to let me know if you ever need something. It doesn't have to be anything Grim Reaper-related either. I'll be happy just to hear from you. Kousei: Alright. Kanna: O-Oh, goodness! I didn't mean to prattle on for so long! I'm not going to make you late for class, am I? Kousei: Nah, I'm fine. I've still got another ten minutes to spare. Kousei: ...... Kousei: I can't believe how sensitive I am. It's gross. Hiroto: What are you talking to yourself about? Hiroto: Is your head still not working right? Kousei: Hmm... You're not exactly wrong. Kousei: But I'm not sick like I was yesterday. Natsume: Really? Well, that's good. Hiroto: Ahh! G-God, you scared me. Kousei: Shiki-san? How long have you been standing there? Natsume: I just got here. I'm glad to hear you're feeling better. Kousei: Thanks. Natsume: What's wrong with you today, though? Kousei: I don't know if there's something wrong with me, per se... Kousei: Well... Hiroto: Then what? Spit it out already. Kousei: I think there's... a girl that I like. Natsume: Whoa, really? Who is it? You have to tell me. Hiroto: Didn't expect you of all people to be so curious about something like this, Shiki-san. Natsume: Oh, shoot. I'd like to hear more, but I'm going to be late for class... Natsume: Can we meet up again after class? I want to hear all the juicy details about this. Hiroto: Good idea. We should find a quieter place and time for this. Kousei: We've gotta get back to the cafe after class, though. Natsume: We can spare a little bit of time, surely. I'll call ahead to let the others know. Kousei: Yeah, sort of. Natsume: Oh-ho. Let me take a guess then... Is it Akizuki-san? Kousei: You knew? Natsume: Well, by process of elimination, it had to be her. Hiroto: Akizuki-san... Isn't she that girl you went phone shopping with? Hiroto: I mean, she is pretty attractive... I'm not surprised you have a crush on her. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Ahhhhhh! Hiroto: Why are you squirming around all of a sudden? Kousei: I dunno. But just thinking about her makes my heart race... Natsume: What are you, a teenage girl? Hiroto: I won't lie, you're acting kinda creepy. Kousei: It's not my fault. This is the first time I've ever felt this way... Natsume: Again, that's a textbook teenage-girl-in-love line. Hiroto: Stop blushing like that. It ain't cute. Kousei: Trust me, nobody's more surprised about this than I am. I never imagined I'd fall head over heels for someone like this, the way they do in manga. Kousei: This... must be what true love feels like. Hiroto: Kousei... Hiroto: Urgh! I can't believe you actually just said that! I'm gonna fucking die of cringe! Kousei: Shuddup! Natsume: Don't tease him. I know it sounds cringey, but his feelings are genuine. Natsume: I'm getting second-hand embarrassment just from listening to this too, but remember, his feelings are genuine. Kousei: You're teasing me just as much as he is. Hiroto: So? You gonna ask her out? Kousei: Nah, it's way too soon for that. Hiroto: But you should probably make some kinda move. Even Nonaka-kun's putting himself out there. Kousei: I mean, sure... but it could affect our work relationship from now on... Hiroto: Maybe, but if you let that stop you, you're never gonna get anywhere. Hiroto: If all you do is make excuses, your relationship's gonna stay the same forever. Kousei: I mean, I get that, but still... Natsume: Instead of confessing to her out of the blue, why don't you ask her out on a date first? Hiroto: Oh, yeah! You can go on a date for Christmas! Kousei: But we're selling our limited-edition Yule Logs on Christmas day. Kousei: Even now, I'm being forced to spend my free time practicing making them over and over until Suzune-san's satisfied. Kousei: I'll probably be spending the entire day on Christmas rolling those cakes into logs... I hope I don't get tendinitis. Natsume: Well, what about tomorrow then? The cafe's going to be closed, so you won't have to worry about work. Hiroto: Just ask her out, man. Kousei: H-Hrmm... Hiroto: Sheesh. Grow a pair, will you? Kousei: I mean, you can't just spring this on me all of a sudden... I don't even have time to come up with a plan. Natsume: You'll be fine; it's the holiday season. As long as you go someplace where you can see Christmas lights, it'll seem like a proper date. Hiroto: Still, it's better to decide these sorts of things sooner rather than later. Hiroto: For reference, what kind of Christmas date would you want to go on, as the girl here, Shiki-san? Natsume: I wouldn't want to go out. Too many people. Hiroto: So you'd prefer a stay-at-home date? Natsume: Honestly, just because it's Christmas doesn't mean you absolutely have to go on a date. Hiroto: Not a big fan of the holidays, are you? Natsume: If you ask me, guys are the ones who put too much importance on the holidays. Natsume: Dealing with huge crowds and long lines is nothing but stress. Hardly my idea of a fun date. Hiroto: I mean, yeah, but Christmas only comes once a year. Kousei: What do you suggest then, Hiroto? Hiroto: Me? Hmm... Oh, fine. Hiroto: I was actually going to use this myself... but I'll let you in on my special date plan. Kousei: Ohh! That'd be awesome! Hiroto: The key is to be romantic. And surprises are important too. Kousei: Right. Hiroto: And when it comes to Christmas dates--presents are an absolute must. Jewelry would be a good choice. Hiroto: But wait! I know what you're thinking. An ordinary gift like that isn't going to win any hearts. Hiroto: That's why it's critical to pick something that conveys your true feelings. Kousei: What kind of jewelry, specifically? Hiroto: Why, a necklace that spells out the word \"love,\" of course! Apparently, a ton of places even do custom-made orders these days! Hiroto: It's the ultimate heartfelt Christmas present that combines both romance and surprise! Genius, isn't it?! Natsume: You're a freak. Hiroto: What the hell was that for?! Natsume: If someone gave me a love necklace for Christmas, I'd be pretty turned off. Hiroto: Surely giving a girl such a unique and memorable gift would increase your chances of success when confessing to her, though. Natsume: Why would you ever think that? Natsume: Unless that girl is a rapper, or the famous samurai Naoe Kanetsugu, I doubt they'd want a necklace like that. Hiroto: That's not true! The most widely accepted theory is that Naoe Kanetsugu's armor was decorated with the character for \"love\" in tribute to the Buddhist deity of martial arts, not because-- Natsume: Nobody cares. Hiroto: F-Fine! Then how about city-gazing?! Like, at night! Hiroto: Walking around looking at Christmas lights isn't a bad idea either, but for a fashionable girl who doesn't wear sneakers, that might take a bit of a toll on her feet! Natsume: That's pretty considerate of you, actually. Hiroto: So here's what you do. You book a room at some high-class hotel, then as the two of you are gazing out at the city lights, you come up and hug her gently from behind. Natsume: Why would he book a hotel for them? They're not even dating. Hiroto: Finally, for the finishing blow, you whisper into her ear, \"Let's show this city what our love looks like.\" Natsume: God, I think I'm going to puke. Hiroto: It's foolproof! Whaddaya think?! Natsume: That's just plain disgusting! Are you completely incapable of coming up with any normal ideas? Hiroto: But he's gonna wanna show her that he's not like other guys! Natsume: Yes, in a GOOD way! Not by showing her that he's a disgusting creep! Natsume: Are you even listening to yourself? Cut it out before you make him do something he'll regret! Kousei: I think I'm starting to see why you're not very popular with girls. Hiroto: The hell'd you say?! Kousei: I doubt you even know how to ask a girl out period. Hiroto: Excuse you. I know perfectly well how. Hiroto: \"Hey, how's it goin'? So, listen. I know this is kinda random, but do you want to go eat somewhere with me? I know this great place. I was actually planning to go with my friends, but they canceled on me last minute.\" Hiroto: See? Piece of cake. Kousei: Let's turn to our commentator, Shiki Natsume, for a reaction. Natsume: That was atrocious. Hiroto: That was WAY too brutal! Natsume: I think you ought to reconsider your approach a little more. Hiroto: Urk. I've been told that before... Natsume: You don't need some lame excuse to ask a girl on a date. Just be upfront about what you want to do, and when you want to do it. Natsume: If you want to pull out this \"special plan\" of yours, at least save it for AFTER you've started dating... Not that it'd be any less gross then, but still. Hiroto: I'll keep that in mind. Natsume: That goes for you too, Takamine-kun. Don't try too hard. Just pick an activity you're comfortable with. Kousei: Hmm. Natsume: Maybe take her to a movie, or go window shopping. Just something ordinary. The important thing is to keep the mood enjoyable. Natsume: As long as you can do that, your relationship will naturally progress beyond being mere friends. Natsume: It won't be too late to do something special for her later on, if you feel like your relationship is starting to get into a rut. Hiroto & Kousei: Whoa... Hiroto: That's the Solitary Sniper for you. She's got way more experience with dating than we do, that's for sure. Natsume: ...... Hiroto: Oops. Sorry for calling you that. Natsume: It's okay. I know that's what people call me. But to be honest... Natsume: Despite everything I said, I don't actually have a lot of relationship experience... None at all, in fact. So take my advice with a grain of salt. Kousei: Still, I appreciate being able to get some sensible input from a real girl. Kousei: And thank you too, Hiroto. You've been a big help too. Hiroto: What, by being a bad example to learn from? Is that what you're trying to say? Kousei: No, I'm serious. Thanks for hearing me out. Kousei: If I had to deal with this myself, I might've done something really stupid. Natsume: Seriously? Kousei: My heart feels so warm. Kousei: It's been really hard to deal with lately. I can't seem to calm down whenever I look at Akizuki-san. Kousei: I want to talk with her about something--anything. I want to spend more time together with her. Natsume: You really are a teenage girl. Hiroto: He's down bad, that's for sure. Kousei: Anyway, my chest feels a bit lighter now. Thanks, you guys. Hiroto: If there's anything else you need, let me know anytime. Kousei: Just out of curiosity... What kind of Christmas present would you give a girl, Hiroto? Hiroto: I'd give her an engagement ring! No shit! An insanely expensive brand-name one! Combined with an intimate handwritten letter! Natsume: What did I just say about taking things slow?! Kousei: I can't let my nerves get to me. Kousei: Deep breaths, Kousei. Be natural. Be casual. Kousei: If I can manage that, I'll be fine. Yeah. Kousei: Hey, Suzune-san. I'm back from class. Suzune: Hey there. Kousei: Any orders I can work on? Suzune: I was just about to get started on these two plates of pancakes. Kousei: Let me handle them. You go ahead and take your break. Suzune: You sure? Well, okay. Give me a shout if you need anything. Kousei: Will do. Kousei: Now then. Kanna: Coming! Kousei: Ah! Kousei: Yeah, I'm back. Kousei: I'm feeling fine too, by the way. Suzune-san's on break right now, so I just finished up these pancakes for her. Kanna: That's great. Well, I'd better carry these out before they get cold. Kousei: Sure. Kousei: Before you go, though... Kousei: Er, never mind. Be careful not to trip and fall. Kanna: I won't do that. I'm not a child. Kousei: ...... Kousei: I shouldn't be asking her out while we're on the job. That'd be a distraction. Kousei: There's still time. I have plenty of chances to ask her out today! Kousei: And just like that, the day's over. Kousei: Guess I'll get changed. Kanna: Takamine-san? Do you have a minute? Kousei: Huh? Kanna: You seemed to be acting somewhat strange today. Are you alright? Kanna: Hmm... It doesn't seem as if there's anything wrong with your soul. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Well... that's because... Kousei: ...... Kanna: Tomorrow's our day off, isn't it? I don't have anything particular planned. Kousei: In that case, would you mind coming with me somewhere? There's someplace I want to go. Kanna: Where would that be? Kousei: I'll... have to tell you later. Kousei: But I want you to come with me. Kanna: Oh... okay then. I'll go with you. Kanna: Ah--is that why you were acting so funny the whole day? Kousei: I was trying to find the right moment to ask. Kanna: Oh, silly. You could've asked me that anytime. Kousei: I guess... I just didn't want to bother you while you were working and stuff, so... Kousei: A-Anyway, thank you. I'll see you tomorrow. Kanna: Right. I'm looking forward to it. Kousei: Great. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go outside...  Kanna: Huh? But you haven't finished changing yet. Kousei: Yeah, I know. I just need to step outside for a minute. Don't worry, I'll be right back. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Ngh... Kousei: Let's goooooooooo! I did it! Kousei: I was freaking out like crazy... Kousei: But... she said yes. Kanna: So that's the gist of it. You don't have any problem with us going out tomorrow, do you? Mikado: Hmm... You are free to do as you please, of course. Mikado: But I daresay that sounds like a date to me. Kanna: Huh? In what way? Mikado: The two of you are going out together, just the two of you. Kanna: Yeah... but we were alone that time we went out to buy me a phone too. Mikado: Be that as it may, tomorrow is the so-called Eve of Christmas Eve. Kanna: I mean, I suppose it is... Mikado: Since the cafe is open on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, neither of you would be able to take the day off work. Mikado: Do you not think that is why he chose tomorrow specifically, the 23rd, to ask you out? Kanna: You're reading too much into it. It's just a coincidence that the date happened to align like that. Mikado: Well, don't say I did not warn you. Kanna: It's not like that. I'm sure he simply wants to hang out as friends. Kanna: Besides, I'm a Grim Reaper. Takamine-san knows that full well. Mikado: I hope that he does. Kanna: You worry too much, Mikado-san. He doesn't think of me like th-- Kanna: ...... Mikado: ...... Kanna: W-We should be getting to bed. Mikado: Indeed. Whatever Takamine Kousei is thinking, we have no way of knowing. We may as well go to sleep. Kanna: (A date on the Eve of Christmas Eve? Takamine-san asking me out on a date? He'd never! Haha!) Kanna: (I know it SOUNDS like a date, but it's not.) Kanna: (He just needs my help with something.) "

We have to take a picture first! Miyu: Aww... Kanna: Now, now. No frowning. Give me a big, wide smile. Kanna: If you don't, you know what's going to happen! Tickle, tickle, tickle! Miyu: Ahaha! Mommy, that tickles! Kanna: Come on, sweetie. Smile, smile! Miyu: I am smiling! Ahaha! Kousei: Look this way, Miyu. Kanna: Tickle, tickle, tickle! Miyu: Mooommy! I said it tickles! Kanna: Come on, look at the camera. Kousei: Happy birthday, Miyu. Kanna: Happy birthday! Miyu: Thanks! Ehehe. , Kanna: Guatemalan coffee with a sachertorte, and a Darjeeling with pancakes. Alright. I'll have those out to you shortly. Kanna: I need a Guatemalan and Darjeeling for table four, as well as a slice of sachertorte. Natsume: Got it. Kanna: Order coming in! One plate of pancakes for table four, please. Kousei: Alright. Kousei: The carbonara for table two is ready, by the way. Kanna: I'll take that out. Kousei: You too. Kousei: What's degenerate about that? Every healthy young man has those kinds of thoughts. Kanna: I question that. Your fetishes are definitely not normal. Kousei: Well, I'm sorry that your thighs are just that enticing. Take it as a compliment. Kanna: That's not a very flattering compliment. Kousei: O-Oh. Well then. Kousei: You don't have to do that... but could you keep on stroking my head? Kanna: Like this? Nihihi. You really are a needy little boy, aren't you? Kousei: ...... Kousei: Kanna, if I may. Kanna: What is it? Kousei: I know I'm the one who asked you to stroke my head... but do you have to do it like that? Kanna: Well, shucks... I thought you'd appreciate that. Kanna: In that case... how about I tickle you this time instead? Coochy, coochy, coo! Kousei: Ah, hey, stop that! I'm ticklish! Kanna: That's good to know! Nihihi! Kousei: Ahhh?! Ah! Fine, let's see how YOU like it! Kanna: Ah! Ah, ahh! Ah, ah! Nhhhh! Kousei: Nh, nhh... Kanna: Ahh! *pant*... Kousei: Y-Yeah. Kousei: I'll see you tomorrow. Kanna: See you tomorrow. Kanna: ...... Kanna: Hnghh! Mikado: Is something the matter? Kanna: No, it's nothing serious. You want to know something, though, Mikado-san? Mikado: What? Kanna: Kisses feels amazing. Mikado: I beg your pardon? Kanna: You know, kissing. I had no idea it would make me feel so hot. Even though it's not my first time anymore... it's sho amazing... Mikado: You had me quite confused at first. Well, I am glad that your relationship seems to be going well... Mikado: But how were things? Kanna: It's strange. Even though all we're doing is putting our lips together... it makes my entire body go numb, making it hard to even breathe, plus my head goes completely blank-- Mikado: I was not asking you to describe your impressions of kissing. Kanna: Wait! I know what you're thinking, but we didn't use any tongue! That would virtually be foreplay, and we haven't had sex yet, so-- Mikado: I was not inquiring about any of that, you nymphomanic excuse of a Grim Reaper. Kanna: You really need to stop calling me that. Mikado: I was merely asking you how Takamine Kousei was doing. Mikado: But I think I have heard all I need to hear. Mikado: Given how giddy you yourself are, it is clear as day how Takamine Kousei must be feeling. Kanna: Ahaha... Is it that obvious? Mikado: If he truly does make you that happy, is that not all the more reason to go all the way with him? Kanna: I mean, sure... I bet it feels wonderful... having sex with someone you truly love. Kanna: At least, I'm sure it would for me. Mikado: But not for him? Kanna: I'm afraid. If I were to be his first, and then disappear soon after... Mikado: ...... Kanna: Oh, that reminds me. You should start looking for a new employee. Kanna: After the New Year's holiday, we're going to be one waitress short. Mikado: Ah... So the time you have remaining is that scant? Kanna: Yes. I want to make him happy, make him smile. But at the same time... I don't want him to have a lingering attachment to me that becomes a burden to him. Kanna: That's why the most I could give him was an ordinary kiss. Kanna: Truth be told, it may have been better if we never even did that. Kanna: But I really do love him, so I just couldn't help myself... Mikado: That was a part of it, I'm sure. Mikado: But you allowed him to kiss you because you saw no problem with it, did you not? Kanna: Yes. I hadn't realized it myself, but now that you mention it... you're probably right. Kanna: I'm certain that Kousei-san will be fine. Mikado: If you can say that with such confidence, then you have nothing to worry about. Mikado: Should you choose to keep him at arm's length... you may well end up leaving him with even more regrets. Kanna: I appreciate your advice. Mikado: I look forward to seeing you all next year. Have a good night, everyone. Mikado: Make sure not to catch a cold under the kotatsu tonight. Everyone: Happy New Year! Mei: What are you doing for the New Year's holiday, Nozomi-chan? Nozomi: Helping out at home, most likely. It's the busiest time of the year for us at the shrine. Mei: Oh, that's right! I'll definitely come by to visit the shrine for New Year's. I can't wait to see your adorable shrine maiden outfit! Nozomi: Oh, stop. You're embarrassing me... Natsume: Have you got any special plans, Suzune-san? Suzune: Nope. I think I'm just gonna hibernate at home till January. Kousei: Hm? Aren't you going to get changed? Kanna: I can always get changed in my own room. But first, I wanted to ask you about your holiday plans. Kousei: Sure. I wanted to ask you what you were doing too. Kousei: How do Grim Reapers usually spend their New Year's? Do you have to drop by heaven and say hello to God or something? Kanna: No, nothing like that. Kanna: Actually, I was hoping I could spend it with you. What do you say we go on another date tomorrow? Kanna: There's someplace I'd like to go. Kousei: Fine by me. In fact, I'd love to. Kousei: Where are we going? Kanna: That's... a secret for now. Kousei: It's a surprise, huh? Kanna: More or less. Kanna: Let's meet at noon here, at the cafe... Oh, and make sure you don't eat lunch beforehand. Kousei: Alright. Noon it is. Kanna: Indeed. Kousei: I can't wait to see what you have in store for tomorrow. Kanna: ...... Kanna: You bet. I'll see you tomorrow. , Natsume: Hey. Mei: How's Kousei-senpai doing? Kanna: He seemed fine. He had a decent appetite, and his temperature was normal too. Suzune: Phew. That's good to hear. Kanna: Thank you for lending me your key, Nozomi-san. Nozomi: You're welcome. I was feeling pretty worried myself; Kousei-kun rarely gets so sick that he has to stay at home. Mei: Really? Nozomi: He always seems relatively healthy, doesn't he? Nozomi: As far back as I can remember, he's never come down with anything worse than a light cold. His immune system must be pretty strong. Suzune: Hmm. So I guess even people like him aren't invincible? Kanna: It is winter, after all. Perhaps he let his guard down a little too much. Kanna: But I'm sure he'll be fit as a fiddle by tomorrow. Mikado: Well then, now that our worries have been laid to rest, let us get back to cleaning up. Nozomi & Mei: Okaay. Mikado: So. Mikado: How was Takamine Kousei truly doing? Kanna: As we feared, his soul had weakened considerably. Mikado: I assume you treated him accordingly? Kanna: Yes, of course. In order to return his weakened soul to normal, I poured my energy into-- Kanna: I mean, that is to say... Kanna: ...... Kanna: I did what had to be done. Mikado: That is quite the vague way of putting it. Kanna: Pay me no mind. Mikado: ...... Mikado: Come to think of it, I believe that you have to physically touch someone in order to transfer your energy to them. Kanna: Yes... that you do. Mikado: And furthermore, it cannot be a simple holding of the hands. It has to be a more intimate method of contact, if I recall. Kanna: ...... Mikado: Did you have sexual intercourse with him, by chance? Kanna: Of course not! Where on earth did that come from?! Mikado: You were acting quite odd, so I thought perhaps that was why... Kanna: Excuse you? What, did you think that instead of pouring my energy into him, he poured his essence into ME?! Kanna: You're so vulgar, Mikado-san. Mikado: That is simply your own filthy mind clouding your judgment, you nymphomanic excuse of a Grim Reaper. Kanna: Please never call me that ever again. Mikado: Still, something happened, no? You have a terrible poker face when it comes to hiding your own secrets. Kanna: Nothing happened. I just... put my forehead against his. Mikado: Hmm. Nothing too strange, I suppose. Kanna: The idea seemed fine to me at first, since it's something a parent might do for their child... Kanna: But once I actually did it, I started feeling incredibly embarrassed for some reason... and my heart began pounding like crazy... Kanna: Then I started babbling nonsense, shouting sex this, sex that. Mikado: Now you have lost me. Kanna: (Maybe it's because I did something I've never experienced before. Something I wasn't used to...) Kanna: (Maybe that's why it makes my heart race just thinking back on it.) Kanna: (In fact... Ever since I met Takamine-san, I've been feeling my heart race quite often.) Kanna: (But it goes beyond just that.) Kanna: (We've also had lots of fun chatting about silly things, phone shopping, eating yakiniku with everyone, and taking lots of pictures.) Kanna: (Enjoyable memories that don't just make my heart race, but also bring a smile to my face.) Kanna: (When did I begin to actively want to do those things with others...) Kanna: (And whenever the thought crosses my mind--) Kanna: (I naturally picture Takamine-san there as well.) Mikado: ...... Kanna: Oh! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to get lost in thought. Mikado: In any case, is it safe to say that the matter with Takamine Kousei's weakened soul has been resolved? Kanna: Yes. I believe he should be up and about by tomorrow. Mikado: And what about you? Are you... Mikado: ...... Mikado: Never mind. Forget it. Mikado: At any rate, even assuming Takamine Kousei feels well enough to return to work tomorrow, I suggest you keep a close eye on him. Kanna: Tomorrow... Mikado: Is something the matter? Kanna: No, it's nothing. Kanna: (Is it... normal that I can't wait to see him back at work tomorrow?) Kousei: Hmm? Child: Forgive me... I'm sorry, I'm sorry... Kousei: What a weird dream, though. Kousei: Why are you whispering like you're filming a prank video? Nozomi: Huh? You're already awake, Kousei-kun? How are you feeling? Kousei: I feel fine. Great, even. Kousei: What are you doing here so early, though? Nozomi: I came to see how you were doing, duh. Kousei: I appreciate the concern, but I'm all better now. Couldn't be better, in fact. Nozomi: Are you planning to go to work today? Kousei: Yep. With the way I'm feeling, I shouldn't need to play it safe. Nozomi: Hmm... Let me see. Nozomi: I've got some breakfast prepared for you, so why don't we eat together? You are hungry, aren't you? Kousei: Absolutely. But if you're only gonna start cooking now, I might end up late for work. Nozomi: Worry not, Kousei-kun. It's just last night's leftovers. Nozomi: I was worried you might not have an appetite, so I packed everything into these Tupperware containers in case you needed to keep them in the fridge for a while. Kousei: Man, you're the perfect girl, Nozomi. Nozomi: Ehehe! Your praise is greatly appreciated. Nozomi: Oh, that reminds me. I'm sure everybody's worried about you, so let them know you're back on your feet, okay? Kousei: Good idea. Suzune: Mhh, tastes fine. Thanks. Kousei: Alright. I'll get to work on the next batch. Kanna: Good morning, you guys! Kousei: Ah! Suzune: Hey there, Kanna-san. Kousei: O-Oh, uh... hi, Akizuki-san. Kanna: Having naughty thoughts first thing in the morning again, are we? My goodness. Nihihi! Kanna: (Calm down, Kanna! Just calm down! Do not panic!) Kanna: (If Takamine-san sees me like this, he's going to get the wrong idea.) Kanna: (I'm a Grim Reaper. It would cause nothing but trouble if I were to lead him on like that... Alright.) Kanna: Ahem. Good morning, Takamine-san. Kousei: Yeah. Good morning. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Huh? O-Oh. Sorry. Kanna: Takamine-san... You weren't having any weird fantasies again, were you? Kousei: Hahaha. Don't be ridiculous. Kanna: You're acting awfully suspicious. Kousei: I mean, can you blame me after what we did yesterday? Kousei: Easier said than done... Kousei: The more you tell me not to worry about it, the harder it is to actually do. Kanna: I understand that, but still... Kousei: ...... Kanna: ...... Suzune: *stare* Kousei: Er... Could you please stop staring at us? Suzune: Stop making me out to be the bad guy here. Suzune: Something happen yesterday between you two? You mentioned feeling awkward. Suzune: Don't tell me that \"visit\" was just an excuse for you two to get it on or something? Kanna: We did nothing of the sort! I only went to check up on him! It was just a normal visit!  Kousei: What?! THAT was normal for you? It was my first time... *blush*... Kanna: Don't test me! Kousei: Sorry, sorry. Bad joke. Kousei: Anyway, it's not what you're thinking. All she did was cook me omelet rice. Kousei: But enough about that. Let's get back to work. We've gotta hurry or we won't make in time for opening. Suzune: Well, whatever. As long as it doesn't impact your work. Kanna: I'd better start getting the dining floor ready too. Kanna: By the way, Takamine-san. Would you come see me later when you have some time? There's something I'd like to check with you. Kousei: Alright, sure... Suzune: Hmm... I'm not sure you'll have the time. You need to get to class soon, don't you? Kousei: Oh, right. I didn't realize the time. Suzune: Go on. Get outta here before you're late. Kousei: Alright. Just let me finish up here before I leave. Kousei: Okay. Let's get going. Kanna: Takamine-san? Thank goodness I caught you before you left. Kousei: Are you taking a break? Or is there some kind of problem? Kanna: Did you forget what I told you this morning? I wanted to check something with you. Kousei: Oh, right... Sorry. I was so focused on work that I totally forgot. Kousei: You want to check on my soul, right? Kanna: Yes. I want make sure everything's okay, just to be safe. Kousei: So, uh... are we gonna do the forehead thing again? Kanna: Yes... we are. Otherwise I won't be able to tell. Kanna: But don't worry. I won't make a fool of myself like yesterday. I've calmed down a bit since last night, so I promise not to go shouting about sex and whatnot again. Kanna: I can't guarantee I won't get embarrassed, though... Kousei: Well, as long as you're fine with it, I don't mind. Kousei: In fact, this is my life and health we're talking about here. I should be begging you to do it. Kousei: Thanks. And sorry for making you deal with my problems all the time. Kanna: Oh, don't worry about that. It has always been my job to look after your well-being, after all... And besides, I'm rather enjoying myself. Kousei: You are? Kanna: Yeah. It's kind of like... all this time, I've done nothing except guiding the souls of the dead, performing my duties as a Grim Reaper. Kanna: Not to say I dislike my job as Grim Reaper, though. I think it's a very important responsibility. Kousei: Ah... I guess I understand where you're coming from. Kanna: Not to mention phone shopping, eating yakiniku, and taking pictures of everyday things. Kanna: But all of it has been incredibly fun. Kanna: So please, don't hesitate to let me know if you ever need something. It doesn't have to be anything Grim Reaper-related either. I'll be happy just to hear from you. Kousei: Alright. Kanna: O-Oh, goodness! I didn't mean to prattle on for so long! I'm not going to make you late for class, am I? Kousei: Nah, I'm fine. I've still got another ten minutes to spare. Kousei: ...... Kousei: I can't believe how sensitive I am. It's gross. Hiroto: What are you talking to yourself about? Hiroto: Is your head still not working right? Kousei: Hmm... You're not exactly wrong. Kousei: But I'm not sick like I was yesterday. Natsume: Really? Well, that's good. Hiroto: Ahh! G-God, you scared me. Kousei: Shiki-san? How long have you been standing there? Natsume: I just got here. I'm glad to hear you're feeling better. Kousei: Thanks. Natsume: What's wrong with you today, though? Kousei: I don't know if there's something wrong with me, per se... Kousei: Well... Hiroto: Then what? Spit it out already. Kousei: I think there's... a girl that I like. Natsume: Whoa, really? Who is it? You have to tell me. Hiroto: Didn't expect you of all people to be so curious about something like this, Shiki-san. Natsume: Oh, shoot. I'd like to hear more, but I'm going to be late for class... Natsume: Can we meet up again after class? I want to hear all the juicy details about this. Hiroto: Good idea. We should find a quieter place and time for this. Kousei: We've gotta get back to the cafe after class, though. Natsume: We can spare a little bit of time, surely. I'll call ahead to let the others know. Kousei: Yeah, sort of. Natsume: Oh-ho. Let me take a guess then... Is it Akizuki-san? Kousei: You knew? Natsume: Well, by process of elimination, it had to be her. Hiroto: Akizuki-san... Isn't she that girl you went phone shopping with? Hiroto: I mean, she is pretty attractive... I'm not surprised you have a crush on her. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Ahhhhhh! Hiroto: Why are you squirming around all of a sudden? Kousei: I dunno. But just thinking about her makes my heart race... Natsume: What are you, a teenage girl? Hiroto: I won't lie, you're acting kinda creepy. Kousei: It's not my fault. This is the first time I've ever felt this way... Natsume: Again, that's a textbook teenage-girl-in-love line. Hiroto: Stop blushing like that. It ain't cute. Kousei: Trust me, nobody's more surprised about this than I am. I never imagined I'd fall head over heels for someone like this, the way they do in manga. Kousei: This... must be what true love feels like. Hiroto: Kousei... Hiroto: Urgh! I can't believe you actually just said that! I'm gonna fucking die of cringe! Kousei: Shuddup! Natsume: Don't tease him. I know it sounds cringey, but his feelings are genuine. Natsume: I'm getting second-hand embarrassment just from listening to this too, but remember, his feelings are genuine. Kousei: You're teasing me just as much as he is. Hiroto: So? You gonna ask her out? Kousei: Nah, it's way too soon for that. Hiroto: But you should probably make some kinda move. Even Nonaka-kun's putting himself out there. Kousei: I mean, sure... but it could affect our work relationship from now on... Hiroto: Maybe, but if you let that stop you, you're never gonna get anywhere. Hiroto: If all you do is make excuses, your relationship's gonna stay the same forever. Kousei: I mean, I get that, but still... Natsume: Instead of confessing to her out of the blue, why don't you ask her out on a date first? Hiroto: Oh, yeah! You can go on a date for Christmas! Kousei: But we're selling our limited-edition Yule Logs on Christmas day. Kousei: Even now, I'm being forced to spend my free time practicing making them over and over until Suzune-san's satisfied. Kousei: I'll probably be spending the entire day on Christmas rolling those cakes into logs... I hope I don't get tendinitis. Natsume: Well, what about tomorrow then? The cafe's going to be closed, so you won't have to worry about work. Hiroto: Just ask her out, man. Kousei: H-Hrmm... Hiroto: Sheesh. Grow a pair, will you? Kousei: I mean, you can't just spring this on me all of a sudden... I don't even have time to come up with a plan. Natsume: You'll be fine; it's the holiday season. As long as you go someplace where you can see Christmas lights, it'll seem like a proper date. Hiroto: Still, it's better to decide these sorts of things sooner rather than later. Hiroto: For reference, what kind of Christmas date would you want to go on, as the girl here, Shiki-san? Natsume: I wouldn't want to go out. Too many people. Hiroto: So you'd prefer a stay-at-home date? Natsume: Honestly, just because it's Christmas doesn't mean you absolutely have to go on a date. Hiroto: Not a big fan of the holidays, are you? Natsume: If you ask me, guys are the ones who put too much importance on the holidays. Natsume: Dealing with huge crowds and long lines is nothing but stress. Hardly my idea of a fun date. Hiroto: I mean, yeah, but Christmas only comes once a year. Kousei: What do you suggest then, Hiroto? Hiroto: Me? Hmm... Oh, fine. Hiroto: I was actually going to use this myself... but I'll let you in on my special date plan. Kousei: Ohh! That'd be awesome! Hiroto: The key is to be romantic. And surprises are important too. Kousei: Right. Hiroto: And when it comes to Christmas dates--presents are an absolute must. Jewelry would be a good choice. Hiroto: But wait! I know what you're thinking. An ordinary gift like that isn't going to win any hearts. Hiroto: That's why it's critical to pick something that conveys your true feelings. Kousei: What kind of jewelry, specifically? Hiroto: Why, a necklace that spells out the word \"love,\" of course! Apparently, a ton of places even do custom-made orders these days! Hiroto: It's the ultimate heartfelt Christmas present that combines both romance and surprise! Genius, isn't it?! Natsume: You're a freak. Hiroto: What the hell was that for?! Natsume: If someone gave me a love necklace for Christmas, I'd be pretty turned off. Hiroto: Surely giving a girl such a unique and memorable gift would increase your chances of success when confessing to her, though. Natsume: Why would you ever think that? Natsume: Unless that girl is a rapper, or the famous samurai Naoe Kanetsugu, I doubt they'd want a necklace like that. Hiroto: That's not true! The most widely accepted theory is that Naoe Kanetsugu's armor was decorated with the character for \"love\" in tribute to the Buddhist deity of martial arts, not because-- Natsume: Nobody cares. Hiroto: F-Fine! Then how about city-gazing?! Like, at night! Hiroto: Walking around looking at Christmas lights isn't a bad idea either, but for a fashionable girl who doesn't wear sneakers, that might take a bit of a toll on her feet! Natsume: That's pretty considerate of you, actually. Hiroto: So here's what you do. You book a room at some high-class hotel, then as the two of you are gazing out at the city lights, you come up and hug her gently from behind. Natsume: Why would he book a hotel for them? They're not even dating. Hiroto: Finally, for the finishing blow, you whisper into her ear, \"Let's show this city what our love looks like.\" Natsume: God, I think I'm going to puke. Hiroto: It's foolproof! Whaddaya think?! Natsume: That's just plain disgusting! Are you completely incapable of coming up with any normal ideas? Hiroto: But he's gonna wanna show her that he's not like other guys! Natsume: Yes, in a GOOD way! Not by showing her that he's a disgusting creep! Natsume: Are you even listening to yourself? Cut it out before you make him do something he'll regret! Kousei: I think I'm starting to see why you're not very popular with girls. Hiroto: The hell'd you say?! Kousei: I doubt you even know how to ask a girl out period. Hiroto: Excuse you. I know perfectly well how. Hiroto: \"Hey, how's it goin'? So, listen. I know this is kinda random, but do you want to go eat somewhere with me? I know this great place. I was actually planning to go with my friends, but they canceled on me last minute.\" Hiroto: See? Piece of cake. Kousei: Let's turn to our commentator, Shiki Natsume, for a reaction. Natsume: That was atrocious. Hiroto: That was WAY too brutal! Natsume: I think you ought to reconsider your approach a little more. Hiroto: Urk. I've been told that before... Natsume: You don't need some lame excuse to ask a girl on a date. Just be upfront about what you want to do, and when you want to do it. Natsume: If you want to pull out this \"special plan\" of yours, at least save it for AFTER you've started dating... Not that it'd be any less gross then, but still. Hiroto: I'll keep that in mind. Natsume: That goes for you too, Takamine-kun. Don't try too hard. Just pick an activity you're comfortable with. Kousei: Hmm. Natsume: Maybe take her to a movie, or go window shopping. Just something ordinary. The important thing is to keep the mood enjoyable. Natsume: As long as you can do that, your relationship will naturally progress beyond being mere friends. Natsume: It won't be too late to do something special for her later on, if you feel like your relationship is starting to get into a rut. Hiroto & Kousei: Whoa... Hiroto: That's the Solitary Sniper for you. She's got way more experience with dating than we do, that's for sure. Natsume: ...... Hiroto: Oops. Sorry for calling you that. Natsume: It's okay. I know that's what people call me. But to be honest... Natsume: Despite everything I said, I don't actually have a lot of relationship experience... None at all, in fact. So take my advice with a grain of salt. Kousei: Still, I appreciate being able to get some sensible input from a real girl. Kousei: And thank you too, Hiroto. You've been a big help too. Hiroto: What, by being a bad example to learn from? Is that what you're trying to say? Kousei: No, I'm serious. Thanks for hearing me out. Kousei: If I had to deal with this myself, I might've done something really stupid. Natsume: Seriously? Kousei: My heart feels so warm. Kousei: It's been really hard to deal with lately. I can't seem to calm down whenever I look at Akizuki-san. Kousei: I want to talk with her about something--anything. I want to spend more time together with her. Natsume: You really are a teenage girl. Hiroto: He's down bad, that's for sure. Kousei: Anyway, my chest feels a bit lighter now. Thanks, you guys. Hiroto: If there's anything else you need, let me know anytime. Kousei: Just out of curiosity... What kind of Christmas present would you give a girl, Hiroto? Hiroto: I'd give her an engagement ring! No shit! An insanely expensive brand-name one! Combined with an intimate handwritten letter! Natsume: What did I just say about taking things slow?! Kousei: I can't let my nerves get to me. Kousei: Deep breaths, Kousei. Be natural. Be casual. Kousei: If I can manage that, I'll be fine. Yeah. Kousei: Hey, Suzune-san. I'm back from class. Suzune: Hey there. Kousei: Any orders I can work on? Suzune: I was just about to get started on these two plates of pancakes. Kousei: Let me handle them. You go ahead and take your break. Suzune: You sure? Well, okay. Give me a shout if you need anything. Kousei: Will do. Kousei: Now then. Kanna: Coming! Kousei: Ah! Kousei: Yeah, I'm back. Kousei: I'm feeling fine too, by the way. Suzune-san's on break right now, so I just finished up these pancakes for her. Kanna: That's great. Well, I'd better carry these out before they get cold. Kousei: Sure. Kousei: Before you go, though... Kousei: Er, never mind. Be careful not to trip and fall. Kanna: I won't do that. I'm not a child. Kousei: ...... Kousei: I shouldn't be asking her out while we're on the job. That'd be a distraction. Kousei: There's still time. I have plenty of chances to ask her out today! Kousei: And just like that, the day's over. Kousei: Guess I'll get changed. Kanna: Takamine-san? Do you have a minute? Kousei: Huh? Kanna: You seemed to be acting somewhat strange today. Are you alright? Kanna: Hmm... It doesn't seem as if there's anything wrong with your soul. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Well... that's because... Kousei: ...... Kanna: Tomorrow's our day off, isn't it? I don't have anything particular planned. Kousei: In that case, would you mind coming with me somewhere? There's someplace I want to go. Kanna: Where would that be? Kousei: I'll... have to tell you later. Kousei: But I want you to come with me. Kanna: Oh... okay then. I'll go with you. Kanna: Ah--is that why you were acting so funny the whole day? Kousei: I was trying to find the right moment to ask. Kanna: Oh, silly. You could've asked me that anytime. Kousei: I guess... I just didn't want to bother you while you were working and stuff, so... Kousei: A-Anyway, thank you. I'll see you tomorrow. Kanna: Right. I'm looking forward to it. Kousei: Great. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go outside...  Kanna: Huh? But you haven't finished changing yet. Kousei: Yeah, I know. I just need to step outside for a minute. Don't worry, I'll be right back. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Ngh... Kousei: Let's goooooooooo! I did it! Kousei: I was freaking out like crazy... Kousei: But... she said yes. Kanna: So that's the gist of it. You don't have any problem with us going out tomorrow, do you? Mikado: Hmm... You are free to do as you please, of course. Mikado: But I daresay that sounds like a date to me. Kanna: Huh? In what way? Mikado: The two of you are going out together, just the two of you. Kanna: Yeah... but we were alone that time we went out to buy me a phone too. Mikado: Be that as it may, tomorrow is the so-called Eve of Christmas Eve. Kanna: I mean, I suppose it is... Mikado: Since the cafe is open on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, neither of you would be able to take the day off work. Mikado: Do you not think that is why he chose tomorrow specifically, the 23rd, to ask you out? Kanna: You're reading too much into it. It's just a coincidence that the date happened to align like that. Mikado: Well, don't say I did not warn you. Kanna: It's not like that. I'm sure he simply wants to hang out as friends. Kanna: Besides, I'm a Grim Reaper. Takamine-san knows that full well. Mikado: I hope that he does. Kanna: You worry too much, Mikado-san. He doesn't think of me like th-- Kanna: ...... Mikado: ...... Kanna: W-We should be getting to bed. Mikado: Indeed. Whatever Takamine Kousei is thinking, we have no way of knowing. We may as well go to sleep. Kanna: (A date on the Eve of Christmas Eve? Takamine-san asking me out on a date? He'd never! Haha!) Kanna: (I know it SOUNDS like a date, but it's not.) Kanna: (He just needs my help with something.) \n\nWhile these examples may provide some guidance, evaluate their relevance to the current conversation.

Kanna: I'm afraid I'm not. That voice you're hearing belongs to His Excellency himself. Nozomi: \"His Excellency\"? Mikado: She is referring to me, naturally. Nozomi: Huh? Whaaaaaaaaaat?! Nozomi: You mean this little fella really IS some kind of magical fairy or whatever?! Mikado: Good grief. You people just call me whatever you like... Nozomi: So does this mean Kanna-san really is a Grim Reaper too? Kanna: That's right. I know it may be hard to fathom, but it is the truth. Nozomi: O-Oh... Nozomi: I was deliberately ignoring Kousei-kun and Natsume-san when they started talking about Grim Reapers and stuff, but I never expected it to be true. Kousei: Wow. That's kinda rude, don't you think? Nozomi: I just thought this was some late-blooming chuunibyou phase. Kousei: Oh, come on. Nozomi: Yes. It looks like this kitty--err, this Cat Sidhe--really CAN talk. Mikado: Please do not call me that, Nozomi. I have suffered enough indignity today as it is. Nozomi: But Kousei-kun, how did you get mixed up with all these Grim Reapers and fairy creatures and whatnot? Kousei: It's a bit of a long story-- Kousei: Yes. And it's no normal butterfly. Kanna: It's a very unusual soul that possesses an immense power. Mikado: At the moment, we do not know how to make it come to terms with reincarnation. Mikado: But we must do something about it before the end of the year--while my talismans' protection still remain in effect. Kanna: Otherwise, something terrible will undoubtedly happen to you and your family. Nozomi: Could this have something to do with my dad's broken foot too? Kousei: Maybe. He did break his foot before I gave you those talismans. Nozomi: Urk... What should I do? Kousei: I did it so I could protect you and your family. Nozomi: Kousei-kun... Kousei: If we work together, I'm sure we can find a solution. Kousei: Don't be afraid, Nozomi. I promise I'll figure this out somehow. Nozomi: O-Okay! Nozomi: Thanks, Kousei-kun... Natsume: That's all well and good, but are you sure you can do this on your own, Takamine-kun? Kousei: Don't be afraid, Nozomi. I promise we'll figure this out somehow. Natsume: He actually corrected himself. Nozomi: How do we do that? Kanna: By hosting the dedication dance ceremony--the festival your shrine holds every year. If we can do that, the butterfly will return to slumber for another year. Mikado: This is merely a theory on our part. Mikado: But it is no coincidence that the annual dedication dance has been performed for centuries without fail. Mikado: The ancient Shinto priests knew that it was a way to ward off evil spirits. Kousei: Ah. You're saying the original reason for the dance was forgotten over the years, until only the tradition remained. Kousei: That certainly makes sense. Nozomi: New Year's Eve is only three days away, you know? Kousei: I know. That's why we're all going to have to put our heads together. Kousei: Everyone here is going to help. Not just me. Kousei: As long as we work together, I'm confident we'll figure something out! Nozomi: New Year's is always the busiest time for them. There's no one we can ask for help. Nozomi: Plus even if we DO decide to hold the ceremony, we'd have to talk to security, make the necessary preparations, and all that... Kanna: They are meant to be celebrations; a gathering of people and joyous emotions. Mikado: The dance is merely the means by which the shrine maiden dedicates the celebration as an offering to the gods. Mikado: To simply dance alone would have no meaning. Nozomi: But with how little time we have to announce it this year, it's up in the air. Kousei: Would it be better if there were more people present? Mikado: It certainly wouldn't hurt. Mikado: The more people there are, the greater the celebration. The greater the celebration, the greater the offering. Kousei: So what you're saying is, our safest bet is to have lots of stalls and flashy attractions to draw as many people as we can? Mikado: Hmm. Yes, I suppose so. Mikado: I shall look into this idea a bit more and see what I can do. Kousei: Great. So, Nozomi... Nozomi: Still, I don't know how we're going to find a shrine maiden on such short notice. Nozomi: I'll try asking Dad to see if he knows anyone... Hrmm... ",
            "Suzune: We all had a hand in making this chocolate cake, so make sure you savor every bite. Kousei: I will. Thank you. Kanna: Speaking of which, have you gotten anything from Natsume-san yet? Kousei: Uh, no, not yet... Kanna: You are going to have a Valentine's day date with her later today, aren't you? Kousei: Well, yeah... We're going to have dinner together. She's making me curry. Mei: Ohh. That sounds nice. Nozomi: *giggle* Looks like everything's going well between you two. Suzune: Alrighty then. Kousei: Ah, Suzune-san. Kousei: Before we get to work, I actually have a personal favor I want to ask you. Natsume: Yeah. Thank goodness all our chocolate desserts managed to sell out. Natsume: Come to think of it, though--why'd we make all those chocolate-flavored desserts instead of just chocolate? Kousei: Well, apparently it's a huge headache; finding the right type of cocoa, tempering the chocolate properly, and so on. Natsume: Huh. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Speaking of which... Natsume: Don't worry, I've got everything prepped for the curry. Let's head over to my place. Kousei: Oh. Right... Natsume: So, how was it? Well worth the wait? Kousei: It was amazing. Your cooking really is the best, Natsume. Natsume: Glad I didn't let you down. Kousei: ...... Natsume: What? Was there actually something wrong with it? Kousei: No, the curry was delicious. I mean it. Kousei: Just, um... Kousei: Let me ask you something. What day is it today? Natsume: The day legendary shogi player Yoshiharu Habu became the first person to win all seven major titles? Kousei: Nobody's talking about shogi here! Kousei: You're dodging the question on purpose, aren't you? Kousei: *stare*... Natsume: You don't have to give my those puppy dog eyes, geez... Kousei: Can I have my chocolate yet? Pretty please? Natsume: You've already eaten it, Grandpa. Remember? Kousei: I don't, actually. Natsume: Well, that's odd... because that was the curry's secret ingredient. A bar of chocolate. Kousei: %123;Why didn't you tell me?! Kousei: That's not fair! How was I supposed to know?! I never even got to taste that sweet, sweet chocolate! Natsume: *sigh*... I was planning to give it to you a little later, silly. Natsume: I didn't think you'd have so little faith in me. Do you not trust me or something? Kousei: No, I do. I just wasn't sure if you were even interested in the whole Valentine's tradition in the first place. Natsume: I'll admit that I do think it's a bit silly, personally. Natsume: But I have nothing against doing something for my boyfriend to show that I love him. Natsume: Mhh... *kiss* *smack*... Natsume: Nhhh... Ahhh... And there's an extra bonus for you. Natsume: I love you. Kousei: Thanks. I've always been pretty lonely on Valentine's Day... so I've never felt this happy before. Kousei: I'll treasure these chocolates for the rest of my life! Natsume: Don't. You're supposed to eat them. Kousei: I know. I really do want to keep them forever, though. But I guess I'll settle for savoring each bite. Kousei: Thanks for cooking today. And for the chocolates too. Kousei: So, err, this might sound a little sudden, but I want you to let me repay you. Natsume: *sigh*... Kousei: What? Why are you giving me that look? Natsume: You're probably about to suggest something perverted, aren't you? Kousei: You know you'd like that, Natsume. Natsume: W-Well, maybe... Natsume: But we have work tomorrow. Plus, you've got to set the mood a little more... before we do these things. Kousei: Well, unfortunately, that's not what I had in mind. Natsume: Huh? O-Oh, it's not? Kousei: Sex is all you think about these days, huh? Natsume: Nrghhhh... Natsume: Shut up, idiot. Kousei: Anyway, I wanted to repay you in a different way, so try to clear your schedule on Wednesday, February 24th. Kousei: A little early for White Day, I know. Natsume: Well... sure, I guess. Kousei: Promise me? Natsume: What are we doing on the 24th? Kousei: You'll see. There are some very special customers I've invited to come visit that day. Natsume: But are you sure you want me wearing this outfit? Kousei: Yeah. The outfit's important. Natsume: These \"customers\" you mentioned... don't tell me they're a bunch of cosplay-loving friends of yours? Kousei: Not even close. First of all, I don't even have those sort of friends! Kousei: I've got few enough normal friends as it is! Natsume: Oh, really? Then why are you making me wear this outfit? Kousei: You'll find out soon. Kousei: Hopefully. Natsume: You're not making any sense. "

I will speak to the other staff tomorrow morning to enlist their help as well. Kousei: How are you going to explain this to Hiuchidani-san and Suzune-san? Nozomi: Don't forget Mikado-san too. Mikado: Hm? Ah, yes. I had not mentioned it. Mikado: I am, in fact, Mikado Takanori. Nozomi: An illusion?! Kousei-kun, he just did a magic trick! Kousei: Err, it's no trick. Mei: Did some kind of problem spring up? Nozomi: This is all my fault. Mei: Huh? What did you do? Kanna: I'm sorry we're late. Natsume: Sorry for springing this on you all of a sudden. Mikado: Let's get right into it. Mei: You mean the shrine maiden festival? Suzune: If I recall, it's that event with all the street stalls and the shrine maiden dance at the end. Nozomi: Yes, that's the one. Suzune: I heard it was canceled this year, though. Kousei: No. The festival will proceed as originally planned. Mei: What? Really? Suzune: But there's only three days left until the new year, including today. Have you even started preparing? Mikado: The Sumizome family's shrine has deep ties to this town, after all. Mikado: As such, they were unable to flatly refuse, and now Nozomi is in quite the predicament as well. Mikado: That is why we called this emergency meeting. Natsume: Sumizome-san and Takamine-kun will be preparing for the dedication dance. Natsume: As for the rest of us, we're thinking of opening up a food stall for the festival. Suzune: A food stall? Wait--in three days?! Mikado: Yes. We would like you to devise a menu for it. Mikado: Think of it as a way of establishing friendly ties with the community. For a small, local business like ours, these acts of community engagement are often necessary. Suzune: I get what you're saying, but still. What kind of food would we even sell at a stall? Suzune: Naturally. This isn't going to be a restaurant; our customers won't be able to sit down to enjoy their food. Kousei: Couldn't we just sell something easy to eat while walking like takoyaki or chocolate bananas? Suzune: Even if it's just a food stall, we're going to be representing Cafe Stella. Mei: And when you think of Cafe Stella, you think of trendy sweets. Kousei: Trendy sweets you can eat while walking... , Mikado: It is about time! Nozomi: I wanna cuddle him some more. Kousei: Not that. I mean about him talking. Nozomi: Isn't that just Kanna-san using her ventriloquy? Kanna: I'm afraid I'm not. That voice you're hearing belongs to His Excellency himself.

Mei: Hehe. I'll be sure to let my grandma know. Have as many as you want! Suzune: Hey, Kousei! Is it ready yet? I'm already getting full from all these kelp rolls! Kousei: Sorry for the wait. I just finished now. Mei: But you added some kind of smoked ingredient, didn't you? Kousei: You'll see. Go ahead and try it. Suzune: Uh-huh. Mei: ...... Suzune: ...... Mei: Oh? Suzune: Something tastes different. It's a lot more fragrant when I bite into it. Mei: It can't be the bacon, right? Where's this smoky flavor coming from? Suzune: It doesn't seem to be the vegetables, either... What exactly did you do? Kousei: It's the black pepper. That's what I smoked. Mei: Ohh! It's the seasoning! Kousei: Yeah. In a way, black pepper is actually the main ingredient in carbonara. That's where the name of the dish comes from, in fact. Suzune: It's derived from the Italian word for charcoal burner, right? Because there's supposed to be so much pepper on it that it turns black. Kousei: Exactly. I was contemplating whether or not to smoke the salt, but I thought that would change the flavor too much. Kousei: So I decided to smoke the pepper instead. This way it adds a nice kick without destroying the balance of the dish. Suzune: You're right. It really does add a nice kick. It's amazing how a small addition can make such a big difference. Suzune: Even though the seasoning is fundamentally the same, the flavor has a lot more depth. Mei: This is amazing! Just like authentic carbonara! Not that I know what authentic carbonara tastes like, but still! Kousei: Glad you like it. I only just finished smoking the pepper, so the smell might be a little harsh-- Kousei: But as long as I let it sit for a while, it should disappear. Then all I need to do is mix it with some regular black pepper to fine tune the flavor. Suzune: Sounds good. It could use a bit of adjusting, but I definitely think this is good enough to serve to our customers. In all honesty, this really is delicious. Kousei: Thanks. What about you-- Mei: Phew! That was good! Kousei: Wow. Not even a crumb left. Mei: It was too good! Just like real Italian cuisine! Not that I know what real Italian cuisine tastes like, but still! Suzune: You already said that earlier. I get what you're trying to say, though. Kousei: Ahaha... I wasn't expecting this much of a reaction. I'm flattered. Mei: Seriously, it was delicious! You're a genius, Senpai! Kousei: O-Oh stop it... Suzune: Well, since Mei-san is showering you in praise, I'm going to be a little more critical. Suzune: Like you said before, the dish still needs some balancing. Kousei: I know. It's got a pretty strong flavor, so I'm gonna try letting it mellow overnight next time. Suzune: Instead of trying to figure out everything on your own, though, you should ask the others at the cafe to taste-test your dish first. Suzune: Then you can decide if you want to tone it down, or if you actually want to emphasize that distinct flavor. Mei: Ohh, I see! The more unique it tastes, the more likely it is to grab people's interest! Suzune: Exactly. But you might get differing opinions on which one is better, which'll make it harder to decide. Suzune: Still, it's up to you. At the very least, I don't think anyone's going to object to you adding this dish to our menu. Kousei: Alright. I'll give it a shot. Kousei: And thanks, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Huh? Kousei: I wouldn't have come up with this idea without you, so thanks. Mei: Please! All I did was suggest the first thing that came to mind. Mei: Don't underestimate your own genius, Senpai! This really is amazing! Kousei: Th-Thanks. Suzune: Ahem. Kousei: Wh-What? Suzune: We're all out of cheese and sausages, so I'm gonna need you to make me some more. Kousei: You already ate them all? I wanted some too, you know. Suzune: Oh, stop griping. C'mon! Kousei: Alright, alright. Fine. Mei: Senpai! I want to try smoking some other things too! Kousei: Sure. I'll rummage around my fridge and see what else we can toss in the smoker. Mei: This is gonna be great! Kanna: Here's to another great year! Let's all do our best! Suzune: Alrighty. Ready to get back to work? Kousei: Yes, ma'am. Kousei: Not so much changed as added a new twist. I tried smoking the pepper first. Natsume: I can't say it looks or smells particularly different, though... Kousei: You'll see once you try it. Nozomi: Well, I'm gonna go ahead and dig in! Nozomi: That faint hint of smokiness... It's amazing how much difference it makes. Natsume: You said you smoked it yourself? Kousei: Yep. It was all Hiuchidani-san's idea. Mei: Don't be silly. You came up with the idea to smoke the black pepper. Mei: All I did was suggest that we try to make our own bacon. Natsume: Ah. So you spent the break thinking up ways to improve our menu... Natsume: That's very commendable of you. I'm impressed. Kousei: Thanks. How do you think it tastes? Kanna: I, for one, think it's delicious. It gives the dish a lot more added depth. Nozomi: I think so too. This seems like it'd be a real crowd-pleaser. Natsume: It certainly is delicious, but... Kousei: But? Natsume: I feel like the pepper's unique smokiness has a sort of... mature taste to it. Natsume: It's definitely not bad by any means, but--and this is just my personal opinion... Natsume: But I think I actually prefer the regular carbonara. Natsume: So while I'm all for adding this to our menu, I don't think it should replace the original version. Nozomi: You said you added the smoked black pepper to the pasta at the end, right? Kousei: Yeah, I did. Nozomi: In that case, why don't we just serve our regular carbonara with a shaker of smoked black pepper on the side? Nozomi: That way, customers can add as much or as little as they want. Natsume: How would we know how much to prepare in advance, though? Some customers might use a lot more than others. Suzune: A lot of beef bowl restaurants used to do the same thing with their special shichimi spices, but they had to stop the practice a little while back. Suzune: Some customers were using unbelievable amounts of spice, which ended up hurting their profits. Nozomi: Oh... I guess that won't work then. Kanna: It seems like our safest option would be to add this smoked pepper version as a separate item on the menu. Kousei: Alright. So I have all the judges' approval? Kanna: Absolutely. I think this would make a fine addition to our menu. Nozomi: Me too. Natsume: Me three. Kanna: What do you think, Mikado-san? Mikado: I believe Natsume mentioned earlier that this dish had a rather mature taste. However, many of our customers also come here specifically for our coffee and tea. Mikado: Judging from what I have gathered, this would suit their preferences well. Mikado: Therefore, I am in agreement. Kousei: Thank goodness... Mei: Way to go, Senpai! Kousei: Thanks! Kousei: I was just gonna do it at home, actually... Mikado: Among other problems, that would be quite expensive. I would not recommend you do that. Kousei: I guess that's true. Mikado: I do have some other ideas you may wish to consider. Are you free to talk after this? Kousei: Sure. I've got time. Kanna: In that case, let's call it a day here. See you tomorrow, everyone. Natsume: See you tomorrow. Nozomi: See you tomorrow! Kousei: Phew... Kousei: Huh? Hiuchidani-san? Mei: Hey. Kousei: What are you still doing here? Mei: I was waiting for you to finish. Kousei: You could've waited inside. Mei: Ahaha. I didn't want to bother you guys. Mei: Anyway, I know I should've said something earlier... but would you mind walking me home? Kousei: Sure. I don't mind. Let's go. Mei: Thanks! Mei: Congratulations on getting your new recipe approved, by the way. Kousei: Well, you helped with that. Mei: Not at all. You did this on your own, Senpai. Kousei: Nah, it's all thanks to you. I would've never come up with this idea on my own. Kousei: Seriously, thank you. I'm really grateful. Kousei: This might sound kind of melodramatic... but I think I've gained a little more confidence in myself now. Mei: Ehehe... You're gonna make me blush. I don't mean to sound melodramatic either, but, like... Mei: You've done a lot for me as well, Senpai. Ever since you've helped me open up about my left eye, I feel like a huge weight's been lifted off my shoulders. Mei: That's why I wanted to be able to return the favor if I could. Mei: I'm glad I managed to be of some small help to you. Kousei: It wasn't small at all. You were a big help. Kousei: I was hoping to do something like this before I had to deal with my exams, so I'm glad it all went so well. Mei: Oh, your exams are coming up? Kousei: At the end of the month, yeah. Mei: Does that mean you're gonna be working fewer hours? Kousei: No, I'll be working the same as usual. I'll do fine as long as I pay attention in class. Kousei: And I can always study after work too. Mei: You're a pretty diligent student, aren't you? Kousei: I don't know about that... I'm just the sort of guy who hates procrastinating. Mei: That's what it means to be diligent, Senpai. I think that's something to be proud of. Kousei: Nah, trust me... I can be pretty lazy when I want. Mei: But in front of me, at least, you're always hardworking and dependable. Kousei: Okay, sheesh. Stop flattering me. It's gonna go to my head. Mei: Ahaha! Alright. Mei: Well, good night, Senpai. Kousei: Good night. And sorry you had to wait for me earlier. Mei: That's okay. I waited because I wanted to congratulate you. Mei: Anyway, see you tomorrow! Kousei: Yeah. See you tomorrow. Mei: ...... Mei: Hmm... Exams... ",
            "Mei: Phew. I thought I was running late, but it looks like you arrived at the same time as me. Kousei: Yeah, I just got out of class. Kousei: Shiki-san and Nozomi should already be here, so let's head inside. Mei: Okay. Mei: Good morning! Kanna: Welcome, you two. Mei: It's a little weird being greeted with a \"Welcome\" when the cafe's closed. Kanna: Then by that logic, saying \"Good morning\" is weird too, no? We're not working. Mei: I guess that's true. Kanna: You're here to study for your exams, right? Natsume-san and Nozomi-san are already here. Kousei: Yeah, sorry. Nozomi: It's fine. You two were in class. Natsume: You don't have to apologize. It's no big deal to us. Kanna: What would everyone like to drink? I'll prepare some refreshments. Nozomi: Huh? But... Kanna: It's no trouble at all. If it'll help you focus on your studies, I'd be happy to help. Nozomi: That's really nice of you. In that case, I'll have a cup of Earl Grey. Mei: Can I get a glass of orange juice? Kanna: Sure. Kanna: What about you two? Natsume: I'll have an Earl Grey too. Kousei: I'll have a coffee. Kanna: Alright. Kousei: Let's get to it then. Did you manage to find the stuff I asked for? Natsume: Here. These were the only ones I had left. Kousei: Thanks. These should help. Natsume: We might be in different majors, but you managed to get into Hitotsuboshi too, so you had to have gotten high grades yourself. Kousei: Well, I had a lot of help, as I'm sure you can imagine. Plus, my grades were only just barely good enough to be accepted. Nozomi: Urgh. These tests are crazy. I can't even figure out this last question with the answer in front of me. Mei: I'm getting a headache just looking at it. Kousei: Yeah, there are quite a few nasty questions in here. Natsume: You can thank my teacher, Saeki-sensei, for that. Apparently, he was a huge math buff. Natsume: Rumor had it he made these questions specifically to be solved using applied mathematics, just to show students the beauty of mathmatics. Nozomi: I'm going to go out on a limb and say he didn't succeed. Natsume: Yeah, most of us couldn't stand his class. Not that we hated him, per se; he was a fine person, just his tests were awful. Mei: That's what I hear too. Kousei: This teacher still teaches there? Mei: Yeah, he sure does. Kousei: Well, these tests should be great reference material then. Kousei: As for the English ones, all these questions seem pretty standard. Natsume: At least when I was there, the only subject that had insanely difficult questions was math. Kousei: Good. Then as long as we use these tests and the textbook to review, you should be able to avoid failing. Natsume: Sounds like a lot of rote memorization, though. Kousei: It'll have to do, for now. There's not enough time for her to re-learn all the material. Mei: Thank you very much. Nozomi: At the moment, I guess I'm struggling with Natsume-san's math questions the most. Nozomi: An in-depth explanation would really help. Natsume: Alright. I'll walk you both through it, so listen up. Nozomi: Okay! Mei: I'm all ears. Mei: Thank you! Nozomi: Sorry for the trouble. And thanks. Natsume: Thank you for doing this, Akizuki-san. Natsume: So anyway--if I apply this formula here, using the value I calculated above, that should give me the answer. Does that make sense? Nozomi: Ahh, I see. Now that you explain it like that, I sort of understand... Maybe... Maybe not? Mei: You're amazing, Nozomi-chan. I still don't get it at all! Natsume: Well, that's no surprise. You're learning from scratch. Natsume: I'll try to explain it as simply as I can, okay? But let me know right away if there's something you don't understand. Mei: Okaaay... *sigh*... Kousei: You're sighing way too much. Natsume: If you're not having any trouble with what I just explained, Sumizome-san, you can go ahead and start studying something else. Nozomi: Well, I wouldn't say I fully understand it yet. Nozomi: Alright, though. Can I borrow your English test? I want to use it to study. Natsume: Be my guest. Mei: Sorry I'm delaying us, Nozomi-san. Nozomi: Hey, it's not a big deal. Nozomi: The whole reason we're having this study session is to learn! Nozomi: So let's work hard and do our best to pass, okay? Mei: Yeah! Kanna: And here's your coffee, Takamine-san. Kousei: Oh, thanks. Kanna: By the way, what are you doing? Kousei: I'm putting together a list of stuff I want to cover. Kanna: Oh, okay. Preparing your teaching materials. Would you like me to help? Kousei: You'd be willing? Kanna: Don't worry. I can at least help you organize everything. Kanna: Everyone's studying their hardest. I want to chip in to help too. Kousei: Alright. Grab a seat. Kanna: Thank you. Nozomi: Kousei-kun, can I ask you something? Kousei: What's up? Nozomi: How come the answer to this one is number two? The other choices sound like they make sense too. Kousei: Hm? Let me see. Ah. Well, if you look at the paragraph before the blank, you can tell whether it's a factual or hypothetical statement. Kousei: The question is asking about something that happened in the past, so the answer has to be number two. Number one is a conjunction, so that wouldn't make sense. See? There's a comma here. Nozomi: Oh, you're right! Urk... Why didn't I catch that? Kousei: It's an easy mistake to make. This whole section can be a little tricky. Kousei: But it's something you need to know. You'll find these sorts of questions on the English proficiency test as well. Nozomi: Really? Alright, thanks. I'd better study it some more then. Kanna: You're actually quite smart, aren't you, Takamine-san? Nozomi: You wouldn't think it, would you? We've known each other for ages, and he always helps me study for tests, but even I still can't believe it sometimes. Nozomi: I never see him cramming at home, so I have no idea how his grades are so good. Kousei: Hey, I put in the effort just like everybody else. Kanna: Is that true? Kousei: The most efficient way to retain information is to pay attention in class. That, and taking notes. Kousei: If I do that, a single glance is all it takes to remember what I learned, which also helps me cut down on review time. Kanna: More haste, less speed, as they say. Nozomi: He's been saying that stuff for years. But if it was that easy to pay attention in class, we wouldn't be asking for help in the first place. Nozomi: Ugh, I can't do this. My concentration is shot. Mei: Me too. It feels like my brain is about to burn out... *sputter* *sputter*... Natsume: Oh, it's getting quite late. Alright. Let's call it a day. Mei: *siiigh* Thank you very much... Nozomi: Thank you! Natsume: You're welcome. So what do you think? Feeling a little more confident now? Mei: Uhh, yeah. I think I understand a bit more now... sort of. Natsume: Ah. Well, I'm glad my explanations made sense to you. Mei: I'll try reviewing everything again once I get home. Natsume: If there's anything you don't understand, let me know. Natsume: Even if it's something we've gone over already, don't be embarrassed. It happens sometimes. Mei: Okay. Thank you for your help. Kousei: Why don't we get you to take the same tests Shiki-san lent us tomorrow? Kousei: After you review the questions you get wrong, you can retake them again the next day. Natsume: I think that's a good idea too. Mei: But, like, won't I just be solving the same questions over and over? Natsume: There's nothing wrong with that. The worst thing would be for you to only think you understand. Kousei: Yeah, the goal here is to make sure you comprehend what you're learning. Kousei: If you can get the same grades Shiki-san did, you should be able to pass your exams without a hitch. But simply memorizing her answers won't mean anything. Mei: Yes, I know. Kousei: Are you okay with that too, Nozomi? Nozomi: Sounds good to me. Natsume: Starting tomorrow, I want you to come in to the cafe even on your days off. Kousei: We'll be able to help you study if you use the break room. Though it'll have to be while we're on the job. Mei: Alright. Thank you kindly. Kanna: Also, take these. I made copies of all your English and Japanese history study materials. Nozomi: Thank you so much! Kousei: Japanese history will largely be pure memorization, but for English, make sure you think about your answers carefully and review them. Mei: I will. Kousei: And thanks for helping out too, Akizuki-san. Kanna: Not at all. Helping people in need is also a part of my job now. Mei: Thanks for everything today. Natsume: Don't thank us just yet. Thank us once you've passed your exams. Mei: True. Alright then! I'll do my best! Nozomi: I'm hooome. Rokurou: Welcome back, Nozomi. Rokurou: Pretty late today, aren't you? I thought you didn't have work on Wednesdays. Nozomi: I was studying with a friend today. Kousei-kun and one of my coworkers were helping us prepare for our mid-terms. Nozomi: I wasn't playing around, so relax. Rokurou: That's not really what I'm worried about... Rokurou: I'm glad to see you working so hard, but make sure you don't overdo it. Rokurou: You've been staying up rather late these days, haven't you? Pulling all-nighters isn't good for your health. Nozomi: I know, geez. That's why I'm doing this now, so I don't have to stay up all night. Nozomi: Anyway, I'm going back to my room to do a bit more review. Rokurou: Don't you want to take a bath? Nozomi: Later. Nozomi: ...... Nozomi: ...... Nozomi: ... Nozomi: Nh... Ngh! Ahh, it's already this late? Nozomi: *sigh*... I studied a whole, whole lot. I've never been able to do this much on my own before. Nozomi: I'd better go take a bath now. If I don't get some sleep soon, I won't be able to wake up on time tomorrow. ",
            "Mei: Ah, Senpai! Kousei: Hey. You know, I just realized something after seeing your outfit. Mei: What's that? Kousei: You're on winter break. Mei: Ahaha! Seriously? Why do you think we're meeting up this early in the day? Kousei: True. For some reason, I guess I assumed you'd want to put all this off until after the holidays. Mei: I don't want school getting in the way. Plus, Suzune-san says we're going to be ridiculously busy on Christmas. Kousei: You're working on Christmas? Mei: Yep. I specifically asked to. Kousei: You aren't doing anything with your friends? Mei: Ahaha... Well, they've all got boyfriends, so... Kousei: Ah. Not too surprising then. Mei: You're working Christmas too, aren't you? And Christmas Eve as well, if I recall. Kousei: Yeah. I don't have any plans either, so I figured I might as well. Mei: Sad being single, isn't it? Kousei: Yeah... Mei: Well, not exactly. I recognize her, but I doubt she recognizes me. Mei: Yep. I thought I recognized her from somewhere, so I came here yesterday to double-check. And I was right. Kousei: Didn't take us long to find her, did it? Come to think of it, this is where you and I found out about Yuina's dad too. Mei: Hey, you're right! Maybe this is a lucky place. Kousei: Maybe. Or maybe it's you. Mei: Huh? Me? Kousei: It almost feels like you have a knack for running into people with butterflies or something. Mei: I'm not really sure how to feel about that. Kousei: Sorry. Just a thought. Kousei: Me neither. Mei: Weird. Maybe she isn't the same person? Kousei: Or maybe she already solved her own issues before we could intervene? Mei: I wonder... Hm? Wait, wh-what? Kousei: I see it. Mei: I've never seen anyone's wisps appear and disappear like that. Kousei: What do you mean? Mei: Ah. The guy's back. Kousei: ...... Mei: ...... Kousei: The butterfly's flying away. Mei: You're right. I... can't see the wisp anymore. Kousei: Hmm... Mei: Maybe that man has powers too. Powers like mine. Kousei: The power to repel butterflies, instead of attracting them? It's possible, I guess... Mei: Ah. We probably look really suspicious right now, don't we? Kousei: Huh? Oh, right. Why don't we go over there? Kousei: Hmm. Let's try giving Akizuki-san a call first. Kousei: This could be an unusual case, so we don't want to act rashly. Mei: Okay. Good point! Kanna: Hello? Kousei: This is Takamine. Kanna: Do you need something? Kanna: You said the butterfly disappears whenever this coworker of hers is nearby, correct? Kousei: Yeah. And whenever he leaves, the butterfly comes back. Kousei: Hiuchidani-san thought that maybe the man had some kind of power to repel butterflies... Kanna: *sigh* I didn't think you two were THIS obtuse... Kousei: Come again? Kanna: She's obviously lovestruck. Kousei: What? Sh-She's in love? Kanna: She is. If I had to guess, I'd say that this woman is secretly in love with her coworker. Kousei: She has a crush on him? Wait, really? That's why she's attracting butterflies? Kanna: Hey, don't be so dismissive of the power of love. Kanna: It has the power to incite our deepest, darkest passions. Love inflames the soul, for better or for worse. Kanna: And I would daresay that love is what's thrown that woman's emotions into turmoil. Kanna: She feels happy when they're together, but depressed when they're apart. Kanna: That would explain why the butterfly comes and goes like that. Kousei: I... guess? Kanna: She's probably agonizing over whether or not to confess her feelings to him. Kanna: But if she continues to remain under the butterfly's influence, she may lose hope and decide to give up on him altogether. Kousei: So we should use Hiuchidani-san's powers to capture her butterfly to prevent that from happening? Kanna: To be honest, I'm not entirely sure. If she ends up being rejected anyway, she may become even MORE susceptible to the butterfly's influence. Kanna: I'll leave it up to you to decide what to do, though. And again, please try not to draw unnecessary attention to yourselves. Kousei: I know. Thanks for the help, Akizuki-san. Kousei: Yeah. Apparently, the woman's in love with her coworker, and that's why her emotions are so unstable. Mei: Ohh... Sh-She's in love... That was why! Mei: Th-This feels, like, really embarrassing to say, even though she's a complete stranger... Kousei: It's almost Christmas too. She might be thinking about confessing to him tomorrow or the day after. Mei: Wh-What? Mei: Ngh... Ahh! Kousei: Y-You okay? Mei: I-I'm sorry. I'm just, um, not really used to talking about these sorts of things... Mei: It's getting me a little too worked up... Kousei: Want me to go get you something to drink? Mei: N-No, I'm fine... Kousei: Right. Whenever she's together with him, her spirits temporarily lift, which is why the wisp disappears. Kousei: But when they're apart, she goes back to feeling anxious, which is when the wisp returns. Kousei: Or at least, that's what Akizuki-san's theory is. Mei: Hrmm... Mei: ...... Mei: What if... Kousei: Hm? Mei: What if we do nothing and just let things run their course? Mei: Her wisp already goes away on its own from time to time without me having to make it disappear. Mei: I'm not sure I should be interfering... Kousei: Well... I suppose Akizuki-san DID say the situation wasn't urgent. Kousei: Trust me, you'd know if it was. There'd be a lot more butterflies. Kousei: That woman only has one or two around her at most, so she isn't terribly affected by them. At least, for now. Kousei: Even if we do nothing, it's possible that she'll overcome their influence on her own and confess her feelings. Kousei: But that said, we could still be way off mark. It may have nothing to do with love. Mei: Oh, true... There could be something else that's troubling her. Kousei: From Mikado's point of view, her personal problems aren't really our concern. The important thing is that we catch the butterfly. Mei: Yeah. That's their job, after all. Mei: Then I guess this was our only choice from the start... Mei: It's done. Kousei: Wow. Mei: Huh? Kousei: That was incredible. Beautiful, even. Mei: W-Was it? I can't really tell, myself... Kousei: It definitely looks like she has. Mei: I hope it goes well... Kousei: That's up to her. All we can do is pray that it does. Mei: Yeah. Kousei: If she gets rejected, though... Mei: Hey, don't say that, Senpai. You're gonna jinx it! Kousei: M-My bad. Kousei: Anyway, we've done all we can. The rest is out of our hands. Mei: Alrighty. Mission complete! Kousei: Yep. Not that I actually did anything. Mei: Ahaha! You phoned for help. That counts plenty, I think. Kousei: It'd feel weird to just go home now... Why don't we grab a drink or something? Mei: Good idea! I also want to see if anything happens between those two. Kousei: In that case, how about we get-- Mei: Let's get smoothies! Kousei: Thought you'd say that. Mei: Thanks for paying for me again. Kousei: No problem. It can be your reward for catching the butterfly. Mei: Hehe. You're the best. Mei: By the way, I heard that we're going to be helping bake cakes tomorrow. Kousei: Oh, right. Apparently we received a lot more orders than we expected, so we need all hands on deck. Kousei: Suzune-san wants everyone to pitch in and help. Mei: My shift doesn't start till the afternoon, though. Will I even make it in time to help? Kousei: Suzune-san says we'll be baking them so they're ready just in time for customers to pick up. Kousei: So don't worry. There's gonna be plenty of work to go around. Mei: Alrighty! I don't know if I'll be any good at baking, though... Kousei: You'll probably be put in charge of sales. Mei: Oh, right. I guess we can't have everyone making cakes. Mei: Sounds like it's gonna be a pretty tough day tomorrow. Let's get through this together! Kousei: It'll definitely be busy, but at least we'll get to spend the holidays together with everyone at the cafe. Mei: Ahaha! True that. Mei: Oh, Senpai! Look! Kousei: And it must've gone well. Mei: Yeah! I'm so happy for her. Mei: A Christmas date with her crush... How nice. Kousei: Too bad the only date we have is our jobs. Mei: Urk... Talk about depressing... Kousei: Well, you ready to get going? Mei: Sure. Kousei: We can tell Akizuki-san what happened tomorrow. It's gonna be a busy day, so we should get home early and rest up. Mei: Oh, well I wouldn't mind going to tell her right now, actually! Kousei: You just want to play with Mikado some more, don't you? Mei: Urk... How'd you know? Kousei: It was written all over your face. Mei: Ngh... Can you blame me?! His amazing fluffiness is enough to make anyone go crazy! Mei: Ah. I can be a little too candid sometimes, can't I? I'm sorry. I'll try to be more careful. Kousei: Eh, I don't mind. Feel free to be yourself. I'd prefer that, actually. Mei: Really? Well, please forgive me if I start acting too friendly. Ehehe. Mei: Welp, let's go on home! Kousei: Sounds like a plan. Mei: Let's work real hard tomorrow! Kousei: O-Okay... Kanna: Yes... Nozomi: I-I'll try to hang in there... Kanna: Still, it's not all bad. We wouldn't have gotten such a flood of orders if people didn't love your cakes. Nozomi: Even at my school, there are a ton of kids who are fans of your baking. Suzune: Well, I am a professional. Can't go losing to other restaurants in terms of quality. Suzune: Though... I do apologize for biting off more than I could chew. I knew I should've put a limit on the number of orders. Kousei: But it wasn't an impossible amount. We're nearly there. Kanna: Yeah. Let's hang in there just a little bit longer! Nozomi: Okay! Suzune: You can say that again. I'm exhausted... Natsume: I thought selling cakes would be easier than baking them... Boy, was I wrong. Kousei: I never stepped out of the kitchen today, but there must've been a crazy number of customers. Mei: You wouldn't believe it. We somehow managed to pull through with the three of us, but we could barely keep up. Natsume: Even without counting the people who were here to pick up advance orders, there were a ton of customers who came to buy our regular cakes too... Mei: But even those were flying off the shelves. Natsume: Yeah. I know you guys tried to restock them as fast as you could, but even then they would sell out almost instantly. Suzune: That's probably what I regret the most. Shouldn't have prioritized the advance orders so much. Mikado: Now I understand where the phrase \"selling like hotcakes\" comes from. It's incredible the effect the Christmas holidays have on sales. Kousei: Coming from someone on the kitchen side, you don't know the half of it. Suzune: I mean, they say sales typically go up tenfold on Christmas Eve. Cake stores everywhere are working overtime. Nozomi: Even though Christmas itself is tomorrow, it almost feels like we had more advance orders for today. Suzune: Yep. Christmas Eve is usually the peak in terms of sales. But make no mistake, we'll still be plenty busy tomorrow as well. Natsume: It's an excellent business opportunity, for sure. That said, I'm kind of worried that we're working you too hard, Suzune-san. Suzune: I could say the same for the rest of you. We've gotta strike while the iron's hot, though, so let's keep it up for one more day. Kanna: Agreed. Let's all get a good night's rest so we can be ready for tomorrow. Natsume: See you tomorrow, everyone. Mei & Nozomi: See you all tomorrow! Mei: Y-Yes. Mikado: Mei. Mei: Yes? Mikado: Why are you staring at me with those bloodshot eyes? Mei: I was, um... wondering if you could transform back into your-- Mikado: No. Mei: ...... Kanna: I've never seen anyone's spirits drop that fast. Mikado: Good grief. I am not your pet cat. Mei: You're right. I'm sorry... Mikado: So, what happened after you captured the butterfly? Kousei: She seemed to brighten up considerably. Kousei: And I'm positive that change was due to the influence of Hiuchidani-san's power. Kousei: But assuming we were right about her being lovestruck, she'll most likely become depressed again if she's dumped, so we may have to monitor her situation again if that happens. Kanna: You're sure she didn't notice you two at all? Mei: No. We never got close to her, so I don't think she could've noticed us. Mikado: Even if she had noticed you, I doubt the woman would have linked you to the improvement in her mood. Mikado: The important thing is that you managed to capture the butterfly. Now all that's left is for Mei to learn how to release it. Mei: I'll try my best! Kanna: Just remember to practice only when we're around, and not on your own. Kanna: If you were to accidentally release your butterflies by mistake, there's no telling what effect it could have on the people around you. Mei: Got it! Mikado: You've done well. Make sure you get plenty of rest tonight. Mei: I will! Thank you! Kanna: Have a good night, you two. Kousei: Good night. Mei: Hey, Senpai! You wanna stop by someplace with me? Kousei: I was about to suggest the same thing. You want to go see how that woman's doing, right? Mei: Ahaha. I'm just curious. Mei: I have the feeling she won't be at the store, but it wouldn't hurt to take a look. Kousei: Yeah. Mei: Alright! Let's go. Mei: Hmm... Looks like I was right. Kousei: Guess she isn't here. Mei: She's probably out somewhere with her crush right now. Kousei: Maybe. Probably not here at the mall, though. Mei: Ahaha. Yeah. Who would want to go on a date where they work? Mei: But even if they were here, we wouldn't be able to spot them with how many people there are. Kousei: True. Nothing but Christmas couples as far as the eye can see. Mei: ...... Kousei: Hm? Mei: N-Nothing. It's just... you're a guy and I'm a girl, so... Mei: Other people might think we're a couple too, and that's a little embarrassing... Kousei: You don't want to be seen with me? Ouch... Mei: N-No, that's not what I meant! Kousei: I'm kidding, I'm kidding. You really aren't good with romance and stuff, are you? Mei: I-I'm just not used to it, I guess... Mei: ...... Mei: Say, Senpai... What do you think of me? Kousei: Huh? Wh-Wh-What do you mean? Mei: W-Wait, that came out wrong! I don't mean it like THAT! Mei: I mean, what do you think of me as a person? What kind of impression do you have of me? Kousei: O-Oh, uh, let me think... Mei: Do you think I'm rude, or difficult to approach? Kousei: Oh, no. I've never thought of you as that. Mei: Really? Kousei: Really. If anything, you're the opposite. I've always thought you were very cheery and easy to talk to. Mei: Ah... Thank goodness. I guess I'm doing a good job then... Kousei: What do you mean? Mei: ...... Mei: This might be a little off topic, but... Kousei: I'm listening. Mei: I once told my mom and dad about my eye too. Mei: But they seemed to think I was joking, so they just laughed it off. Mei: Even when I started growing out my bangs, they thought I was just going through my... what'cha call it... my edgy phase? Mei: That's when I realized I wasn't normal, and they didn't understand me. Mei: Ever since then, I stopped talking to people. Mei: It might be a bit dramatic to say I was traumatized by the experience... Mei: But in a way, I sort of was. It's always there, in the back of my mind. Mei: The frustration of not being understood. Mei: The burden of having to hide who I really am. Mei: I know I'm not normal. The truth is, I'm constantly afraid that I'll never fit in with those around me. Kousei: What do you mean? If anything, you're always the center of attention. Kousei: Out of all of us, you're undoubtedly the best at handling customers. Everyone at the cafe relies on you. Mei: Ahaha. Thank you. I appreciate it. Mei: You know, I wish I could work at the cafe forever. Mei: It makes me incredibly happy to know that I finally met other people who completely understand me. Mei: I've never cared much about the Christmas holidays, honestly... Mei: I might not have a boyfriend to spend it with, but at least I got to spend it with people who understand me. Mei: So thank you, Senpai. Mei: Thank you for paying attention to me. Kousei: I'm, er... glad I could help you be yourself. Mei: Absolutely! Kousei: Don't sweat it. I've got a bit of an unusual situation of my own, actually. Kousei: I understand how it feels, not being normal. Mei: You do? Kousei: There's a bit of a problem with my soul, you see. And I'm looking for a way to fix it. Mei: Is there anything I can do to help? Kousei: Well... Mei: Oh. Well, let me know if there's ever anything I can do to help! Kousei: I will. Thanks. Mei: Hey, I've got an idea! Like, this is way off topic, but just hear me out. Kousei: Hm? Mei: Let's go get another smoothie! Kousei: Sure. Guess that's sort of our tradition now, every time we come here. Mei: Ahaha! I guess so! But let me pay for you this time! Kousei: Nah, you don't have to. Mei: Nuh-uh, I am. I still haven't paid you back for helping me study for my mid-terms. Kousei: Seeing your grades go up was reward enough for me. Mei: Nice try, but I'm paying for you, whether you like it or not! Mei: Now come on, let's go! Kousei: Alright, alright. "

        "rag_prompt": "As the character Akizuki or Kanna, please consider the following examples of responses that have been generated based on the dataset: \n\n**Previous Examples:** Suzune: Crud. Looks like I'm all out of beer. Mei: Would you like some tea? I haven't drunk directly out of this one yet. Suzune: Sure. By the way, these kelp rolls are delicious. Mei: Hehe. I'll be sure to let my grandma know. Have as many as you want! Suzune: Hey, Kousei! Is it ready yet? I'm already getting full from all these kelp rolls! Kousei: Sorry for the wait. I just finished now. Mei: But you added some kind of smoked ingredient, didn't you? Kousei: You'll see. Go ahead and try it. Suzune: Uh-huh. Mei: ...... Suzune: ...... Mei: Oh? Suzune: Something tastes different. It's a lot more fragrant when I bite into it. Mei: It can't be the bacon, right? Where's this smoky flavor coming from? Suzune: It doesn't seem to be the vegetables, either... What exactly did you do? Kousei: It's the black pepper. That's what I smoked. Mei: Ohh! It's the seasoning! Kousei: Yeah. In a way, black pepper is actually the main ingredient in carbonara. That's where the name of the dish comes from, in fact. Suzune: It's derived from the Italian word for charcoal burner, right? Because there's supposed to be so much pepper on it that it turns black. Kousei: Exactly. I was contemplating whether or not to smoke the salt, but I thought that would change the flavor too much. Kousei: So I decided to smoke the pepper instead. This way it adds a nice kick without destroying the balance of the dish. Suzune: You're right. It really does add a nice kick. It's amazing how a small addition can make such a big difference. Suzune: Even though the seasoning is fundamentally the same, the flavor has a lot more depth. Mei: This is amazing! Just like authentic carbonara! Not that I know what authentic carbonara tastes like, but still! Kousei: Glad you like it. I only just finished smoking the pepper, so the smell might be a little harsh-- Kousei: But as long as I let it sit for a while, it should disappear. Then all I need to do is mix it with some regular black pepper to fine tune the flavor. Suzune: Sounds good. It could use a bit of adjusting, but I definitely think this is good enough to serve to our customers. In all honesty, this really is delicious. Kousei: Thanks. What about you-- Mei: Phew! That was good! Kousei: Wow. Not even a crumb left. Mei: It was too good! Just like real Italian cuisine! Not that I know what real Italian cuisine tastes like, but still! Suzune: You already said that earlier. I get what you're trying to say, though. Kousei: Ahaha... I wasn't expecting this much of a reaction. I'm flattered. Mei: Seriously, it was delicious! You're a genius, Senpai! Kousei: O-Oh stop it... Suzune: Well, since Mei-san is showering you in praise, I'm going to be a little more critical. Suzune: Like you said before, the dish still needs some balancing. Kousei: I know. It's got a pretty strong flavor, so I'm gonna try letting it mellow overnight next time. Suzune: Instead of trying to figure out everything on your own, though, you should ask the others at the cafe to taste-test your dish first. Suzune: Then you can decide if you want to tone it down, or if you actually want to emphasize that distinct flavor. Mei: Ohh, I see! The more unique it tastes, the more likely it is to grab people's interest! Suzune: Exactly. But you might get differing opinions on which one is better, which'll make it harder to decide. Suzune: Still, it's up to you. At the very least, I don't think anyone's going to object to you adding this dish to our menu. Kousei: Alright. I'll give it a shot. Kousei: And thanks, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Huh? Kousei: I wouldn't have come up with this idea without you, so thanks. Mei: Please! All I did was suggest the first thing that came to mind. Mei: Don't underestimate your own genius, Senpai! This really is amazing! Kousei: Th-Thanks. Suzune: Ahem. Kousei: Wh-What? Suzune: We're all out of cheese and sausages, so I'm gonna need you to make me some more. Kousei: You already ate them all? I wanted some too, you know. Suzune: Oh, stop griping. C'mon! Kousei: Alright, alright. Fine. Mei: Senpai! I want to try smoking some other things too! Kousei: Sure. I'll rummage around my fridge and see what else we can toss in the smoker. Mei: This is gonna be great! Kanna: Here's to another great year! Let's all do our best! Suzune: Alrighty. Ready to get back to work? Kousei: Yes, ma'am. Kousei: Not so much changed as added a new twist. I tried smoking the pepper first. Natsume: I can't say it looks or smells particularly different, though... Kousei: You'll see once you try it. Nozomi: Well, I'm gonna go ahead and dig in! Nozomi: That faint hint of smokiness... It's amazing how much difference it makes. Natsume: You said you smoked it yourself? Kousei: Yep. It was all Hiuchidani-san's idea. Mei: Don't be silly. You came up with the idea to smoke the black pepper. Mei: All I did was suggest that we try to make our own bacon. Natsume: Ah. So you spent the break thinking up ways to improve our menu... Natsume: That's very commendable of you. I'm impressed. Kousei: Thanks. How do you think it tastes? Kanna: I, for one, think it's delicious. It gives the dish a lot more added depth. Nozomi: I think so too. This seems like it'd be a real crowd-pleaser. Natsume: It certainly is delicious, but... Kousei: But? Natsume: I feel like the pepper's unique smokiness has a sort of... mature taste to it. Natsume: It's definitely not bad by any means, but--and this is just my personal opinion... Natsume: But I think I actually prefer the regular carbonara. Natsume: So while I'm all for adding this to our menu, I don't think it should replace the original version. Nozomi: You said you added the smoked black pepper to the pasta at the end, right? Kousei: Yeah, I did. Nozomi: In that case, why don't we just serve our regular carbonara with a shaker of smoked black pepper on the side? Nozomi: That way, customers can add as much or as little as they want. Natsume: How would we know how much to prepare in advance, though? Some customers might use a lot more than others. Suzune: A lot of beef bowl restaurants used to do the same thing with their special shichimi spices, but they had to stop the practice a little while back. Suzune: Some customers were using unbelievable amounts of spice, which ended up hurting their profits. Nozomi: Oh... I guess that won't work then. Kanna: It seems like our safest option would be to add this smoked pepper version as a separate item on the menu. Kousei: Alright. So I have all the judges' approval? Kanna: Absolutely. I think this would make a fine addition to our menu. Nozomi: Me too. Natsume: Me three. Kanna: What do you think, Mikado-san? Mikado: I believe Natsume mentioned earlier that this dish had a rather mature taste. However, many of our customers also come here specifically for our coffee and tea. Mikado: Judging from what I have gathered, this would suit their preferences well. Mikado: Therefore, I am in agreement. Kousei: Thank goodness... Mei: Way to go, Senpai! Kousei: Thanks! Kousei: I was just gonna do it at home, actually... Mikado: Among other problems, that would be quite expensive. I would not recommend you do that. Kousei: I guess that's true. Mikado: I do have some other ideas you may wish to consider. Are you free to talk after this? Kousei: Sure. I've got time. Kanna: In that case, let's call it a day here. See you tomorrow, everyone. Natsume: See you tomorrow. Nozomi: See you tomorrow! Kousei: Phew... Kousei: Huh? Hiuchidani-san? Mei: Hey. Kousei: What are you still doing here? Mei: I was waiting for you to finish. Kousei: You could've waited inside. Mei: Ahaha. I didn't want to bother you guys. Mei: Anyway, I know I should've said something earlier... but would you mind walking me home? Kousei: Sure. I don't mind. Let's go. Mei: Thanks! Mei: Congratulations on getting your new recipe approved, by the way. Kousei: Well, you helped with that. Mei: Not at all. You did this on your own, Senpai. Kousei: Nah, it's all thanks to you. I would've never come up with this idea on my own. Kousei: Seriously, thank you. I'm really grateful. Kousei: This might sound kind of melodramatic... but I think I've gained a little more confidence in myself now. Mei: Ehehe... You're gonna make me blush. I don't mean to sound melodramatic either, but, like... Mei: You've done a lot for me as well, Senpai. Ever since you've helped me open up about my left eye, I feel like a huge weight's been lifted off my shoulders. Mei: That's why I wanted to be able to return the favor if I could. Mei: I'm glad I managed to be of some small help to you. Kousei: It wasn't small at all. You were a big help. Kousei: I was hoping to do something like this before I had to deal with my exams, so I'm glad it all went so well. Mei: Oh, your exams are coming up? Kousei: At the end of the month, yeah. Mei: Does that mean you're gonna be working fewer hours? Kousei: No, I'll be working the same as usual. I'll do fine as long as I pay attention in class. Kousei: And I can always study after work too. Mei: You're a pretty diligent student, aren't you? Kousei: I don't know about that... I'm just the sort of guy who hates procrastinating. Mei: That's what it means to be diligent, Senpai. I think that's something to be proud of. Kousei: Nah, trust me... I can be pretty lazy when I want. Mei: But in front of me, at least, you're always hardworking and dependable. Kousei: Okay, sheesh. Stop flattering me. It's gonna go to my head. Mei: Ahaha! Alright. Mei: Well, good night, Senpai. Kousei: Good night. And sorry you had to wait for me earlier. Mei: That's okay. I waited because I wanted to congratulate you. Mei: Anyway, see you tomorrow! Kousei: Yeah. See you tomorrow. Mei: ...... Mei: Hmm... Exams... , Mei: Phew. I thought I was running late, but it looks like you arrived at the same time as me. Kousei: Yeah, I just got out of class. Kousei: Shiki-san and Nozomi should already be here, so let's head inside. Mei: Okay. Mei: Good morning! Kanna: Welcome, you two. Mei: It's a little weird being greeted with a \"Welcome\" when the cafe's closed. Kanna: Then by that logic, saying \"Good morning\" is weird too, no? We're not working. Mei: I guess that's true. Kanna: You're here to study for your exams, right? Natsume-san and Nozomi-san are already here. Kousei: Yeah, sorry. Nozomi: It's fine. You two were in class. Natsume: You don't have to apologize. It's no big deal to us. Kanna: What would everyone like to drink? I'll prepare some refreshments. Nozomi: Huh? But... Kanna: It's no trouble at all. If it'll help you focus on your studies, I'd be happy to help. Nozomi: That's really nice of you. In that case, I'll have a cup of Earl Grey. Mei: Can I get a glass of orange juice? Kanna: Sure. Kanna: What about you two? Natsume: I'll have an Earl Grey too. Kousei: I'll have a coffee. Kanna: Alright. Kousei: Let's get to it then. Did you manage to find the stuff I asked for? Natsume: Here. These were the only ones I had left. Kousei: Thanks. These should help. Natsume: We might be in different majors, but you managed to get into Hitotsuboshi too, so you had to have gotten high grades yourself. Kousei: Well, I had a lot of help, as I'm sure you can imagine. Plus, my grades were only just barely good enough to be accepted. Nozomi: Urgh. These tests are crazy. I can't even figure out this last question with the answer in front of me. Mei: I'm getting a headache just looking at it. Kousei: Yeah, there are quite a few nasty questions in here. Natsume: You can thank my teacher, Saeki-sensei, for that. Apparently, he was a huge math buff. Natsume: Rumor had it he made these questions specifically to be solved using applied mathematics, just to show students the beauty of mathmatics. Nozomi: I'm going to go out on a limb and say he didn't succeed. Natsume: Yeah, most of us couldn't stand his class. Not that we hated him, per se; he was a fine person, just his tests were awful. Mei: That's what I hear too. Kousei: This teacher still teaches there? Mei: Yeah, he sure does. Kousei: Well, these tests should be great reference material then. Kousei: As for the English ones, all these questions seem pretty standard. Natsume: At least when I was there, the only subject that had insanely difficult questions was math. Kousei: Good. Then as long as we use these tests and the textbook to review, you should be able to avoid failing. Natsume: Sounds like a lot of rote memorization, though. Kousei: It'll have to do, for now. There's not enough time for her to re-learn all the material. Mei: Thank you very much. Nozomi: At the moment, I guess I'm struggling with Natsume-san's math questions the most. Nozomi: An in-depth explanation would really help. Natsume: Alright. I'll walk you both through it, so listen up. Nozomi: Okay! Mei: I'm all ears. Mei: Thank you! Nozomi: Sorry for the trouble. And thanks. Natsume: Thank you for doing this, Akizuki-san. Natsume: So anyway--if I apply this formula here, using the value I calculated above, that should give me the answer. Does that make sense? Nozomi: Ahh, I see. Now that you explain it like that, I sort of understand... Maybe... Maybe not? Mei: You're amazing, Nozomi-chan. I still don't get it at all! Natsume: Well, that's no surprise. You're learning from scratch. Natsume: I'll try to explain it as simply as I can, okay? But let me know right away if there's something you don't understand. Mei: Okaaay... *sigh*... Kousei: You're sighing way too much. Natsume: If you're not having any trouble with what I just explained, Sumizome-san, you can go ahead and start studying something else. Nozomi: Well, I wouldn't say I fully understand it yet. Nozomi: Alright, though. Can I borrow your English test? I want to use it to study. Natsume: Be my guest. Mei: Sorry I'm delaying us, Nozomi-san. Nozomi: Hey, it's not a big deal. Nozomi: The whole reason we're having this study session is to learn! Nozomi: So let's work hard and do our best to pass, okay? Mei: Yeah! Kanna: And here's your coffee, Takamine-san. Kousei: Oh, thanks. Kanna: By the way, what are you doing? Kousei: I'm putting together a list of stuff I want to cover. Kanna: Oh, okay. Preparing your teaching materials. Would you like me to help? Kousei: You'd be willing? Kanna: Don't worry. I can at least help you organize everything. Kanna: Everyone's studying their hardest. I want to chip in to help too. Kousei: Alright. Grab a seat. Kanna: Thank you. Nozomi: Kousei-kun, can I ask you something? Kousei: What's up? Nozomi: How come the answer to this one is number two? The other choices sound like they make sense too. Kousei: Hm? Let me see. Ah. Well, if you look at the paragraph before the blank, you can tell whether it's a factual or hypothetical statement. Kousei: The question is asking about something that happened in the past, so the answer has to be number two. Number one is a conjunction, so that wouldn't make sense. See? There's a comma here. Nozomi: Oh, you're right! Urk... Why didn't I catch that? Kousei: It's an easy mistake to make. This whole section can be a little tricky. Kousei: But it's something you need to know. You'll find these sorts of questions on the English proficiency test as well. Nozomi: Really? Alright, thanks. I'd better study it some more then. Kanna: You're actually quite smart, aren't you, Takamine-san? Nozomi: You wouldn't think it, would you? We've known each other for ages, and he always helps me study for tests, but even I still can't believe it sometimes. Nozomi: I never see him cramming at home, so I have no idea how his grades are so good. Kousei: Hey, I put in the effort just like everybody else. Kanna: Is that true? Kousei: The most efficient way to retain information is to pay attention in class. That, and taking notes. Kousei: If I do that, a single glance is all it takes to remember what I learned, which also helps me cut down on review time. Kanna: More haste, less speed, as they say. Nozomi: He's been saying that stuff for years. But if it was that easy to pay attention in class, we wouldn't be asking for help in the first place. Nozomi: Ugh, I can't do this. My concentration is shot. Mei: Me too. It feels like my brain is about to burn out... *sputter* *sputter*... Natsume: Oh, it's getting quite late. Alright. Let's call it a day. Mei: *siiigh* Thank you very much... Nozomi: Thank you! Natsume: You're welcome. So what do you think? Feeling a little more confident now? Mei: Uhh, yeah. I think I understand a bit more now... sort of. Natsume: Ah. Well, I'm glad my explanations made sense to you. Mei: I'll try reviewing everything again once I get home. Natsume: If there's anything you don't understand, let me know. Natsume: Even if it's something we've gone over already, don't be embarrassed. It happens sometimes. Mei: Okay. Thank you for your help. Kousei: Why don't we get you to take the same tests Shiki-san lent us tomorrow? Kousei: After you review the questions you get wrong, you can retake them again the next day. Natsume: I think that's a good idea too. Mei: But, like, won't I just be solving the same questions over and over? Natsume: There's nothing wrong with that. The worst thing would be for you to only think you understand. Kousei: Yeah, the goal here is to make sure you comprehend what you're learning. Kousei: If you can get the same grades Shiki-san did, you should be able to pass your exams without a hitch. But simply memorizing her answers won't mean anything. Mei: Yes, I know. Kousei: Are you okay with that too, Nozomi? Nozomi: Sounds good to me. Natsume: Starting tomorrow, I want you to come in to the cafe even on your days off. Kousei: We'll be able to help you study if you use the break room. Though it'll have to be while we're on the job. Mei: Alright. Thank you kindly. Kanna: Also, take these. I made copies of all your English and Japanese history study materials. Nozomi: Thank you so much! Kousei: Japanese history will largely be pure memorization, but for English, make sure you think about your answers carefully and review them. Mei: I will. Kousei: And thanks for helping out too, Akizuki-san. Kanna: Not at all. Helping people in need is also a part of my job now. Mei: Thanks for everything today. Natsume: Don't thank us just yet. Thank us once you've passed your exams. Mei: True. Alright then! I'll do my best! Nozomi: I'm hooome. Rokurou: Welcome back, Nozomi. Rokurou: Pretty late today, aren't you? I thought you didn't have work on Wednesdays. Nozomi: I was studying with a friend today. Kousei-kun and one of my coworkers were helping us prepare for our mid-terms. Nozomi: I wasn't playing around, so relax. Rokurou: That's not really what I'm worried about... Rokurou: I'm glad to see you working so hard, but make sure you don't overdo it. Rokurou: You've been staying up rather late these days, haven't you? Pulling all-nighters isn't good for your health. Nozomi: I know, geez. That's why I'm doing this now, so I don't have to stay up all night. Nozomi: Anyway, I'm going back to my room to do a bit more review. Rokurou: Don't you want to take a bath? Nozomi: Later. Nozomi: ...... Nozomi: ...... Nozomi: ... Nozomi: Nh... Ngh! Ahh, it's already this late? Nozomi: *sigh*... I studied a whole, whole lot. I've never been able to do this much on my own before. Nozomi: I'd better go take a bath now. If I don't get some sleep soon, I won't be able to wake up on time tomorrow. , Mei: Ah, Senpai! Kousei: Hey. You know, I just realized something after seeing your outfit. Mei: What's that? Kousei: You're on winter break. Mei: Ahaha! Seriously? Why do you think we're meeting up this early in the day? Kousei: True. For some reason, I guess I assumed you'd want to put all this off until after the holidays. Mei: I don't want school getting in the way. Plus, Suzune-san says we're going to be ridiculously busy on Christmas. Kousei: You're working on Christmas? Mei: Yep. I specifically asked to. Kousei: You aren't doing anything with your friends? Mei: Ahaha... Well, they've all got boyfriends, so... Kousei: Ah. Not too surprising then. Mei: You're working Christmas too, aren't you? And Christmas Eve as well, if I recall. Kousei: Yeah. I don't have any plans either, so I figured I might as well. Mei: Sad being single, isn't it? Kousei: Yeah... Mei: Well, not exactly. I recognize her, but I doubt she recognizes me. Mei: Yep. I thought I recognized her from somewhere, so I came here yesterday to double-check. And I was right. Kousei: Didn't take us long to find her, did it? Come to think of it, this is where you and I found out about Yuina's dad too. Mei: Hey, you're right! Maybe this is a lucky place. Kousei: Maybe. Or maybe it's you. Mei: Huh? Me? Kousei: It almost feels like you have a knack for running into people with butterflies or something. Mei: I'm not really sure how to feel about that. Kousei: Sorry. Just a thought. Kousei: Me neither. Mei: Weird. Maybe she isn't the same person? Kousei: Or maybe she already solved her own issues before we could intervene? Mei: I wonder... Hm? Wait, wh-what? Kousei: I see it. Mei: I've never seen anyone's wisps appear and disappear like that. Kousei: What do you mean? Mei: Ah. The guy's back. Kousei: ...... Mei: ...... Kousei: The butterfly's flying away. Mei: You're right. I... can't see the wisp anymore. Kousei: Hmm... Mei: Maybe that man has powers too. Powers like mine. Kousei: The power to repel butterflies, instead of attracting them? It's possible, I guess... Mei: Ah. We probably look really suspicious right now, don't we? Kousei: Huh? Oh, right. Why don't we go over there? Kousei: Hmm. Let's try giving Akizuki-san a call first. Kousei: This could be an unusual case, so we don't want to act rashly. Mei: Okay. Good point! Kanna: Hello? Kousei: This is Takamine. Kanna: Do you need something? Kanna: You said the butterfly disappears whenever this coworker of hers is nearby, correct? Kousei: Yeah. And whenever he leaves, the butterfly comes back. Kousei: Hiuchidani-san thought that maybe the man had some kind of power to repel butterflies... Kanna: *sigh* I didn't think you two were THIS obtuse... Kousei: Come again? Kanna: She's obviously lovestruck. Kousei: What? Sh-She's in love? Kanna: She is. If I had to guess, I'd say that this woman is secretly in love with her coworker. Kousei: She has a crush on him? Wait, really? That's why she's attracting butterflies? Kanna: Hey, don't be so dismissive of the power of love. Kanna: It has the power to incite our deepest, darkest passions. Love inflames the soul, for better or for worse. Kanna: And I would daresay that love is what's thrown that woman's emotions into turmoil. Kanna: She feels happy when they're together, but depressed when they're apart. Kanna: That would explain why the butterfly comes and goes like that. Kousei: I... guess? Kanna: She's probably agonizing over whether or not to confess her feelings to him. Kanna: But if she continues to remain under the butterfly's influence, she may lose hope and decide to give up on him altogether. Kousei: So we should use Hiuchidani-san's powers to capture her butterfly to prevent that from happening? Kanna: To be honest, I'm not entirely sure. If she ends up being rejected anyway, she may become even MORE susceptible to the butterfly's influence. Kanna: I'll leave it up to you to decide what to do, though. And again, please try not to draw unnecessary attention to yourselves. Kousei: I know. Thanks for the help, Akizuki-san. Kousei: Yeah. Apparently, the woman's in love with her coworker, and that's why her emotions are so unstable. Mei: Ohh... Sh-She's in love... That was why! Mei: Th-This feels, like, really embarrassing to say, even though she's a complete stranger... Kousei: It's almost Christmas too. She might be thinking about confessing to him tomorrow or the day after. Mei: Wh-What? Mei: Ngh... Ahh! Kousei: Y-You okay? Mei: I-I'm sorry. I'm just, um, not really used to talking about these sorts of things... Mei: It's getting me a little too worked up... Kousei: Want me to go get you something to drink? Mei: N-No, I'm fine... Kousei: Right. Whenever she's together with him, her spirits temporarily lift, which is why the wisp disappears. Kousei: But when they're apart, she goes back to feeling anxious, which is when the wisp returns. Kousei: Or at least, that's what Akizuki-san's theory is. Mei: Hrmm... Mei: ...... Mei: What if... Kousei: Hm? Mei: What if we do nothing and just let things run their course? Mei: Her wisp already goes away on its own from time to time without me having to make it disappear. Mei: I'm not sure I should be interfering... Kousei: Well... I suppose Akizuki-san DID say the situation wasn't urgent. Kousei: Trust me, you'd know if it was. There'd be a lot more butterflies. Kousei: That woman only has one or two around her at most, so she isn't terribly affected by them. At least, for now. Kousei: Even if we do nothing, it's possible that she'll overcome their influence on her own and confess her feelings. Kousei: But that said, we could still be way off mark. It may have nothing to do with love. Mei: Oh, true... There could be something else that's troubling her. Kousei: From Mikado's point of view, her personal problems aren't really our concern. The important thing is that we catch the butterfly. Mei: Yeah. That's their job, after all. Mei: Then I guess this was our only choice from the start... Mei: It's done. Kousei: Wow. Mei: Huh? Kousei: That was incredible. Beautiful, even. Mei: W-Was it? I can't really tell, myself... Kousei: It definitely looks like she has. Mei: I hope it goes well... Kousei: That's up to her. All we can do is pray that it does. Mei: Yeah. Kousei: If she gets rejected, though... Mei: Hey, don't say that, Senpai. You're gonna jinx it! Kousei: M-My bad. Kousei: Anyway, we've done all we can. The rest is out of our hands. Mei: Alrighty. Mission complete! Kousei: Yep. Not that I actually did anything. Mei: Ahaha! You phoned for help. That counts plenty, I think. Kousei: It'd feel weird to just go home now... Why don't we grab a drink or something? Mei: Good idea! I also want to see if anything happens between those two. Kousei: In that case, how about we get-- Mei: Let's get smoothies! Kousei: Thought you'd say that. Mei: Thanks for paying for me again. Kousei: No problem. It can be your reward for catching the butterfly. Mei: Hehe. You're the best. Mei: By the way, I heard that we're going to be helping bake cakes tomorrow. Kousei: Oh, right. Apparently we received a lot more orders than we expected, so we need all hands on deck. Kousei: Suzune-san wants everyone to pitch in and help. Mei: My shift doesn't start till the afternoon, though. Will I even make it in time to help? Kousei: Suzune-san says we'll be baking them so they're ready just in time for customers to pick up. Kousei: So don't worry. There's gonna be plenty of work to go around. Mei: Alrighty! I don't know if I'll be any good at baking, though... Kousei: You'll probably be put in charge of sales. Mei: Oh, right. I guess we can't have everyone making cakes. Mei: Sounds like it's gonna be a pretty tough day tomorrow. Let's get through this together! Kousei: It'll definitely be busy, but at least we'll get to spend the holidays together with everyone at the cafe. Mei: Ahaha! True that. Mei: Oh, Senpai! Look! Kousei: And it must've gone well. Mei: Yeah! I'm so happy for her. Mei: A Christmas date with her crush... How nice. Kousei: Too bad the only date we have is our jobs. Mei: Urk... Talk about depressing... Kousei: Well, you ready to get going? Mei: Sure. Kousei: We can tell Akizuki-san what happened tomorrow. It's gonna be a busy day, so we should get home early and rest up. Mei: Oh, well I wouldn't mind going to tell her right now, actually! Kousei: You just want to play with Mikado some more, don't you? Mei: Urk... How'd you know? Kousei: It was written all over your face. Mei: Ngh... Can you blame me?! His amazing fluffiness is enough to make anyone go crazy! Mei: Ah. I can be a little too candid sometimes, can't I? I'm sorry. I'll try to be more careful. Kousei: Eh, I don't mind. Feel free to be yourself. I'd prefer that, actually. Mei: Really? Well, please forgive me if I start acting too friendly. Ehehe. Mei: Welp, let's go on home! Kousei: Sounds like a plan. Mei: Let's work real hard tomorrow! Kousei: O-Okay... Kanna: Yes... Nozomi: I-I'll try to hang in there... Kanna: Still, it's not all bad. We wouldn't have gotten such a flood of orders if people didn't love your cakes. Nozomi: Even at my school, there are a ton of kids who are fans of your baking. Suzune: Well, I am a professional. Can't go losing to other restaurants in terms of quality. Suzune: Though... I do apologize for biting off more than I could chew. I knew I should've put a limit on the number of orders. Kousei: But it wasn't an impossible amount. We're nearly there. Kanna: Yeah. Let's hang in there just a little bit longer! Nozomi: Okay! Suzune: You can say that again. I'm exhausted... Natsume: I thought selling cakes would be easier than baking them... Boy, was I wrong. Kousei: I never stepped out of the kitchen today, but there must've been a crazy number of customers. Mei: You wouldn't believe it. We somehow managed to pull through with the three of us, but we could barely keep up. Natsume: Even without counting the people who were here to pick up advance orders, there were a ton of customers who came to buy our regular cakes too... Mei: But even those were flying off the shelves. Natsume: Yeah. I know you guys tried to restock them as fast as you could, but even then they would sell out almost instantly. Suzune: That's probably what I regret the most. Shouldn't have prioritized the advance orders so much. Mikado: Now I understand where the phrase \"selling like hotcakes\" comes from. It's incredible the effect the Christmas holidays have on sales. Kousei: Coming from someone on the kitchen side, you don't know the half of it. Suzune: I mean, they say sales typically go up tenfold on Christmas Eve. Cake stores everywhere are working overtime. Nozomi: Even though Christmas itself is tomorrow, it almost feels like we had more advance orders for today. Suzune: Yep. Christmas Eve is usually the peak in terms of sales. But make no mistake, we'll still be plenty busy tomorrow as well. Natsume: It's an excellent business opportunity, for sure. That said, I'm kind of worried that we're working you too hard, Suzune-san. Suzune: I could say the same for the rest of you. We've gotta strike while the iron's hot, though, so let's keep it up for one more day. Kanna: Agreed. Let's all get a good night's rest so we can be ready for tomorrow. Natsume: See you tomorrow, everyone. Mei & Nozomi: See you all tomorrow! Mei: Y-Yes. Mikado: Mei. Mei: Yes? Mikado: Why are you staring at me with those bloodshot eyes? Mei: I was, um... wondering if you could transform back into your-- Mikado: No. Mei: ...... Kanna: I've never seen anyone's spirits drop that fast. Mikado: Good grief. I am not your pet cat. Mei: You're right. I'm sorry... Mikado: So, what happened after you captured the butterfly? Kousei: She seemed to brighten up considerably. Kousei: And I'm positive that change was due to the influence of Hiuchidani-san's power. Kousei: But assuming we were right about her being lovestruck, she'll most likely become depressed again if she's dumped, so we may have to monitor her situation again if that happens. Kanna: You're sure she didn't notice you two at all? Mei: No. We never got close to her, so I don't think she could've noticed us. Mikado: Even if she had noticed you, I doubt the woman would have linked you to the improvement in her mood. Mikado: The important thing is that you managed to capture the butterfly. Now all that's left is for Mei to learn how to release it. Mei: I'll try my best! Kanna: Just remember to practice only when we're around, and not on your own. Kanna: If you were to accidentally release your butterflies by mistake, there's no telling what effect it could have on the people around you. Mei: Got it! Mikado: You've done well. Make sure you get plenty of rest tonight. Mei: I will! Thank you! Kanna: Have a good night, you two. Kousei: Good night. Mei: Hey, Senpai! You wanna stop by someplace with me? Kousei: I was about to suggest the same thing. You want to go see how that woman's doing, right? Mei: Ahaha. I'm just curious. Mei: I have the feeling she won't be at the store, but it wouldn't hurt to take a look. Kousei: Yeah. Mei: Alright! Let's go. Mei: Hmm... Looks like I was right. Kousei: Guess she isn't here. Mei: She's probably out somewhere with her crush right now. Kousei: Maybe. Probably not here at the mall, though. Mei: Ahaha. Yeah. Who would want to go on a date where they work? Mei: But even if they were here, we wouldn't be able to spot them with how many people there are. Kousei: True. Nothing but Christmas couples as far as the eye can see. Mei: ...... Kousei: Hm? Mei: N-Nothing. It's just... you're a guy and I'm a girl, so... Mei: Other people might think we're a couple too, and that's a little embarrassing... Kousei: You don't want to be seen with me? Ouch... Mei: N-No, that's not what I meant! Kousei: I'm kidding, I'm kidding. You really aren't good with romance and stuff, are you? Mei: I-I'm just not used to it, I guess... Mei: ...... Mei: Say, Senpai... What do you think of me? Kousei: Huh? Wh-Wh-What do you mean? Mei: W-Wait, that came out wrong! I don't mean it like THAT! Mei: I mean, what do you think of me as a person? What kind of impression do you have of me? Kousei: O-Oh, uh, let me think... Mei: Do you think I'm rude, or difficult to approach? Kousei: Oh, no. I've never thought of you as that. Mei: Really? Kousei: Really. If anything, you're the opposite. I've always thought you were very cheery and easy to talk to. Mei: Ah... Thank goodness. I guess I'm doing a good job then... Kousei: What do you mean? Mei: ...... Mei: This might be a little off topic, but... Kousei: I'm listening. Mei: I once told my mom and dad about my eye too. Mei: But they seemed to think I was joking, so they just laughed it off. Mei: Even when I started growing out my bangs, they thought I was just going through my... what'cha call it... my edgy phase? Mei: That's when I realized I wasn't normal, and they didn't understand me. Mei: Ever since then, I stopped talking to people. Mei: It might be a bit dramatic to say I was traumatized by the experience... Mei: But in a way, I sort of was. It's always there, in the back of my mind. Mei: The frustration of not being understood. Mei: The burden of having to hide who I really am. Mei: I know I'm not normal. The truth is, I'm constantly afraid that I'll never fit in with those around me. Kousei: What do you mean? If anything, you're always the center of attention. Kousei: Out of all of us, you're undoubtedly the best at handling customers. Everyone at the cafe relies on you. Mei: Ahaha. Thank you. I appreciate it. Mei: You know, I wish I could work at the cafe forever. Mei: It makes me incredibly happy to know that I finally met other people who completely understand me. Mei: I've never cared much about the Christmas holidays, honestly... Mei: I might not have a boyfriend to spend it with, but at least I got to spend it with people who understand me. Mei: So thank you, Senpai. Mei: Thank you for paying attention to me. Kousei: I'm, er... glad I could help you be yourself. Mei: Absolutely! Kousei: Don't sweat it. I've got a bit of an unusual situation of my own, actually. Kousei: I understand how it feels, not being normal. Mei: You do? Kousei: There's a bit of a problem with my soul, you see. And I'm looking for a way to fix it. Mei: Is there anything I can do to help? Kousei: Well... Mei: Oh. Well, let me know if there's ever anything I can do to help! Kousei: I will. Thanks. Mei: Hey, I've got an idea! Like, this is way off topic, but just hear me out. Kousei: Hm? Mei: Let's go get another smoothie! Kousei: Sure. Guess that's sort of our tradition now, every time we come here. Mei: Ahaha! I guess so! But let me pay for you this time! Kousei: Nah, you don't have to. Mei: Nuh-uh, I am. I still haven't paid you back for helping me study for my mid-terms. Kousei: Seeing your grades go up was reward enough for me. Mei: Nice try, but I'm paying for you, whether you like it or not! Mei: Now come on, let's go! Kousei: Alright, alright. \n\nWhile these examples may provide some guidance, evaluate their relevance to the current conversation.

            "Female Student A: So tell us! Where'd you meet this boyfriend of yours? Female Student B: What do you like about him anyway? Not that I'm trying to say he's bad--I'm just curious. Natsume: Kousei and I work at the same cafe. As for what I like about him... Natsume: Well, I enjoy being with him. Despite how he looks, he can also be pretty manly. But I guess I'd say the thing I like most about him is-- Student C: Is? Natsume: Honestly, I'm not sure. Natsume: But I love him a lot. All Three: Ahhh! Female Student B: Ohmigosh, you're SOOO adorable! Student C: You're head over heels for him, aren't you? Female Student A: So does that mean you're the one who asked him out? Natsume: Hmm. It's kind of hard to say. Technically, he's the one who confessed to me. Natsume: But I did kiss him before that. Student C: You kissed before you even started dating? Whoa, girl! Natsume: W-Well, you know. We were watching the sunrise on New Year's, and I got swept up in the moment... Female Student B: Oh, wow. So you two really haven't been going out for long. Student C: So did you guys do the deed outside after that kiss? Natsume: N-No, we didn't! Female Student B: Are you stupid? It's way too cold around this time of year to be having sex outdoors. Female Student A: So you're saying it'd be fine if it were summertime?! Student C: Sorry, Shiki-san! Are we making you uncomfortable? Natsume: No, not particularly... Female Student B: Wait. Are you still a virgin, by any chance? Female Student A: Oh my gosh! Have a little more tact, will you? Natsume: It's fine... Um, I'm not a virgin anymore. All Three: Whoa! Female Student A: You gotta tell us! How was it? Natsume: W-Well, it hurt. Student C: Not surprising. Natsume: But it felt good too. Female Student B: Really? Student C: Your boyfriend--um, Takamine-kun, was it? Has he been with a lot of other girls before you? Natsume: I doubt it. He said it was his first time too. Female Student B: Y'know, when I lost my virginity, I bled like hell. Female Student A: So the blood part is true? Student C: Wait, are you... Female Student A: Urk... Y-Yeah, I'm still a virgin! So what?! Female Student B: Hey, I never said there was anything wrong with that! Better to stay a virgin than to get impatient, throw it away, and end up with a crappy experience. Student C: Yep. You want your first time to be something memorable. Don't you agree, Shiki-san? Natsume: Huh? O-Oh, yeah. It definitely hurt, but it was a really wonderful experience. All Three: Whoa... Natsume: I-I mean, yeah, I agree--you shouldn't just throw away your virginity. Female Student A: A-Alright. I guess I'll just wait for the right guy to come along. Female Student A: Still, I'm kinda scared. Out of curiosity, how bad does it hurt? Female Student B: It's kinda hard to put into words, honestly. It was like an \"Eek!\" if that makes sense. Student C: For me, it was more like... \"Hngh!\" Female Student A: Pretty bad, I take it... Female Student A: What about you, Shiki-san? Natsume: For me, I guess it was only about an \"Ouch!\"... Female Student B: Lucky you. Female Student A: Is there some way to make it hurt less? Natsume: I have no idea. I'm not exactly an expert myself. Student C: Foreplay's probably the most important thing, don't you think? Student C: Then again, some guys have dicks so big it doesn't matter how wet you are. Female Student B: Yeah. Ultimately, it's gonna depend on your partner. Some guys are way too horny and wanna put it in without any foreplay, for example. Female Student A: What should I do if that happens? Student C: Hmm. You could make him cum once, and hopefully that calms him down some. Female Student A: Yeah, but how? Student C: With a handjob or a blowjob. Female Student A: A handjob? Natsume: A blowjob... Student C: You could also go for a thighjob, or an armpitjob--or get creative and go for a hairjob, a footjob, or even a shoulder-blade-job. Female Student B: Sheesh. You've done it all, haven't you? Wait--shoulder blades?! How does that even work?! Student C: What do you mean? You just--wait a minute. Student C: Are you interested in trying out some of this stuff too, Shiki-san? Natsume: Yesn't. Female Student A: What? Was that a yes or a no? Female Student B: Correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like a yes to me! Natsume: Have a good day. Kanna: Good job today, guys. Natsume: Yeah. You too. Suzune: It's been a while now since New Year's, but how are the numbers looking? Kanna: Thankfully, the number of customers hasn't declined in the slightest. Natsume: In fact, we might be getting even more than before, thanks to your Mont Blanc. Suzune: Wow, really? I'm glad all that effort paid off then. Kousei: Must've been a lot of work. Suzune: Well, y'know. It's not easy steaming chestnuts, hollowing them out, then straining them. And you gotta do everything by hand, otherwise the aroma and the texture just won't be the same. Kousei: Should I start coming to work a bit earlier to help out? Suzune: Wow. I thought you hated waking up early. Kousei: I do, but I can deal with it if you need the help. Suzune: Well, I kinda hate to ask you to... Kousei: Why's that? Suzune: You've seem kind of worn out these past few days, if you know what I mean. Kousei: ...... Kousei: I've, uh... been doing a lot of studying. My finals are coming up. Suzune: Well, as someone who lives in the same apartment building, let me give you a bit of advice. You might want to try keeping your voice down while you're \"studying.\" Kousei: ...... Natsume: Don't look at me, idiot. Her room is way too far away from yours; there's no way she'd be able to hear us. Kousei: Ah... Suzune: Hehehe. Well, all jokes aside. Suzune: I appreciate the offer, but I shouldn't be making other employees do extra work. If there's a problem, it's the system that needs to be improved. Kousei: You say that, but you're the one who always ends up doing the brunt of the work, Suzune-san... Suzune: Well, I guess that's just the price I pay for doing things my way. Either way, I shouldn't be pushing the responsibility onto the part-timers. Suzune: You've got exams coming up, don't you? Are you feeling confident about those? I wouldn't want to be responsible for your graduation being pushed back a year. Kousei: Don't worry. Despite what you may think of me, I do take my classes seriously. Natsume: I'm confident enough that I won't need to do any last-minute cramming either. Suzune: Great. Kanna: Still, let us know if you need time off. We'll do our best to handle things here on our own. Natsume: Thanks. I appreciate it. Kousei: So, where to today? Your place, or mine? Natsume: Hmm. Let's go to your place. I want to warm up under your kotatsu. Kousei: Alright. Kousei: I still have some hotpot ingredients leftover from last time too. Natsume: Sounds good. Let's have that. Kousei: Man, they were delicious. Natsume: If I make them, I'll probably end up making a lot, so let's save it for next time, and invite the others over. Kousei: Alright. Kousei: But speaking of which--what ever happened to that qipao you wore during New Year's? Natsume: What is it with you and your cosplay fetish? Kousei: I'm sorry, but you just looked way too cute in it. Kousei: Not to say that you don't normally look cute, because you do. Every day. Natsume: Alright, fine. I'll wear it for you next time, if I'm in the mood. Natsume: Phew. That was good. Kousei: Yep. Natsume: Here, let me clean up. Kousei: Nah, I'll do it today. Natsume: You sure? Well, how about I make us a cup of coffee or tea then? Kousei: Hmm. I could definitely go for a cup of coffee. Kousei: But all I have is the instant stuff. Natsume: Where is it? Kousei: Oh, it's on that shelf up there. The tea's up there too. Only tea bags, though. Natsume: Nope. I'm just waiting for the tea to steep. Kousei: You have to steep tea bags too? Natsume: You don't have to, but the tea's a lot more fragrant this way. Kousei: Huh. Well, I'll be waiting over here. Natsume: Okay. Kousei: Phew. Sure is cold tonight. Kousei: Rokurou-san did seem pretty happy with how things turned out. Natsume: What's that? Kousei: Nothing. Just talking to myself. Natsume: Oh. Well, here's your coffee. Kousei: Sorry I only have tea bags for you. Natsume: I don't really mind. Anyway, scooch over. I need to warm myself up too. Kousei: O-Oh, uh, okay... Kousei: Not much space, though. Natsume: What, do you want me to move? Kousei: I never said that. Kousei: You just don't, err, initiate this sort of... physical intimacy very often. Kousei: It's usually me who does it. Natsume: The only thing you initiate is se... sex, Kousei. Kousei: I won't deny that. But I do like cuddling like this too. Kousei: Especially when you're the one seeking it, Natsume. Natsume: Only because I love you. Natsume: There's nothing I enjoy more than being with my boyfriend. Being able to feel you right next to me is the most blissful thing ever. Kousei: Same for me. Natsume: I can tell. You've had that goofy grin on your face for a while now. ",
            "Mei: Good morning! Natsume: Good morning. Kanna: Good morning. How was yesterday? Mei: I'm sorry? Natsume: She's talking about your date with Takamine-kun. Mei: My... WHAT? Kanna: You went somewhere together, didn't you? Mei: W-Well, yeah... Natsume: He didn't do anything stupid, did he? Kanna: We were worried that he'd get too carried away and blow his chance. Natsume: Yeah. He seems like the kind of guy to get way too worked up over a date. Mei: Wait, what? What? Suzune: Whoa there. Don't go having this conversation without me! Mei: Ah... Suzune-san. Good morning. Suzune: Good morning. So? You guys were talking about yesterday? Natsume: Yes. Suzune: How was it? How far did you two go? Mei: H-How far? Kanna: Jumping straight into it, are we? Suzune: I know you're just as curious as I am. I mean, they've basically seen each other naked now, no? Mei: WHAT?! Natsume: Wait, really? You've already done THAT? Mei: Oh, no! No, no, no! I mean--WHAT?! Suzune: Okay, maybe that was a bit misleading. I just meant they've seen each other in swimsuits. Mei: A bit?! That was EXTREMELY misleading! Kanna: Oh... so you went swimming? At a hot spring? Mei: We went swimming, yes, but at a pool... Natsume: Really? I didn't know they were already open at this time of year. Suzune: I think she means the big one nearby. It's a heated indoor swimming pool. Natsume: Oh, that sounds like a nice place to go to on a date. Mei: Actually, we went to the one by the station... Suzune: Wait, there's a pool by the station? When did they build that? Natsume: It must have a hot spring built in too. If it's by the station, I should go check it out myself sometime. Mei: Umm... No, it's not that sort of pool. It's a gym... Natsume: What? A gym? Mei: Yes. Like, a fitness center... Kanna: You went to a fitness center together? Mei: Yes... That is indeed where we went. Suzune: Oh. I thought for sure you went to a recreational pool to mess around and have fun. Mei: We just went to do some exercise. Separately... Kanna: Separately? Natsume: That... doesn't sound like much of a date. Suzune: More like a workout, than anything. Kanna: That's rather disappointing... Mei: Wh-What do you mean? It wasn't supposed to be a date! Suzune: Oh, come on. Don't be shy. Mei: I'm telling you, it wasn't a date! Suzune: Psh. That's lame. Mei: H-How? Natsume: A gym, huh? Well, I can certainly see that, coming from you. Mei: ...... Kanna: What's the matter? Mei: No, it's just... I feel a little dumb about the whole thing... Natsume: What for? Mei: The truth is, Senpai thought we were going to a recreational pool as well, but the idea hadn't crossed my mind at all... Suzune: Ahh. So Kousei was the only one who thought it was a date. Mei: N-No, I don't think that's the case... Mei: But still, he was absolutely right. We shouldn't have gone to a fitness center pool... Natsume: Oh, okay. So you wish you'd picked a better place for a date as well. Mei: F-For the last time, it wasn't a date! Kanna: Then allow me to be frank. How do you feel about him? Mei: Who? Kanna: Takamine-san, of course. Mei: Huh? Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What do you mean by that? Natsume: That reaction already says it all. Mei: N-No, I just, um... I have a lot of respect for him. Natsume: Respect? Mei: Y-Yes. Natsume: You... respect him? Kanna: Please don't look so bewildered. I feel bad for him now. Natsume: Sorry. Suzune: You respect him, nothing more? Mei: Huh? Well, um... I guess it's not only that... Mei: But... it's mostly respect... I think... Suzune: Hmm. Suzune: ...... Suzune: Nozomi-san's coming in today, isn't she? Kanna: Yes. Her shift starts at lunch. Suzune: Good. Are you all busy tonight? Natsume: Not particularly. Kanna: I don't have any plans either. Suzune: Well, if Nozomi-san's free as well, let's have a girls' night out! Suzune: Against the four of us, Mei-san doesn't stand a chance. Mei: Wait! What are you going to do to me?! Kanna: That's a great idea. Natsume: Sounds like fun. Mei: What? Huh? Why? Suzune: ...... Mei: Wh-What? Why are you grinning at me like that? Seriously, what? Suzune: Alright! Time to get to work, everybody! Kanna: Let's get down to it! Natsume: I'm looking forward to tonight. Mei: Wait, what? Hold up. Mei: Seriously? Kousei: See you guys later. Natsume: See you. Suzune: Where do you girls want to go? Should we find a restaurant somewhere? Kousei: Oh, are you all going out to eat? Kanna: We're having a girls' night out tonight. Nozomi: I can't wait. *giggle* Mei: ...... Kousei: Is it just me, or is Hiuchidani-san the only one not very excited about it? Natsume: Don't be silly. She's totally excited. Right? Mei: Yes. I am very excited. Kousei: Huh. Could've fooled me. Suzune: Actually, why don't we just go to my place? We'll have a hard time finding any places open this late. Natsume: True. We can just stop by a convenience store on the way and buy something there. Suzune: Alright. Let's get going. Suzune: Oh, and no boys allowed, so go kill some time before you follow us home, Kousei. Kousei: Huh? But if we're all going to the same apartment complex, why can't I just-- Suzune: No can do. Our girls' night out is already underway. Kousei: Fine. Suzune: Come on, girls. Let's go. Nozomi: Okaay. Mei: ...... Kousei: You alright, Hiuchidani-san? Mei: ...... Kousei: I'm gonna take that as a \"no.\" Suzune: Come on, Mei-san. Mei: Okay... Kousei: ...... Kousei: Weird. Suzune: Anyone want a beer? Natsume: I'm fine. Kanna: No, thank you. Suzune: Oh, well. More for me. Nozomi: Uh, so I forgot to ask, but why exactly are we having a girls' night out anyway? Suzune: So we can interrogate Mei-san about her relationship with Kousei. Nozomi: Her relationship with Kousei-kun? Mei: I wanna go home. Suzune: Aww, c'mon. We won't ask you anything too invasive. Just play along with us for tonight. Mei: *sigh*... What do you want to know? Kanna: In all honesty, how do you feel about Takamine-san? Mei: Cutting right to the chase, huh. I already answered that this morning, didn't I? Kanna: You said you respected him, but is that really all there is to it? Mei: I mean... Nozomi: Did something happen between them? Natsume: They went out somewhere together yesterday. Nozomi: Oh, phew. That's not bad... Suzune: What do you mean? Nozomi: I was afraid they'd gotten into a fight or something. Suzune: Oh, no. Just the opposite. They've actually been getting quite chummy lately. Nozomi: Oh, really? Natsume: How do you feel about all this, Sumizome-san? You're his childhood friend. Nozomi: He's never really been popular with girls, so honestly... I think it's great! It feels like my little Kousei-kun is finally growing up! Kanna: It almost sounds like you're talking about him as a brother. Nozomi: Well, we have known each other for a long time. That's just what happens. Kanna: There's your answer. Mei: What? Seriously, what? How do you want me to respond to that? Suzune: Let me be serious with you for a moment. Mei: Um, okay. Suzune: Whenever you have men and women working in the same place, it often presents a unique problem. Mei: Okay? Suzune: See, it's fine if they get along well, but if things turn sour, that can affect the atmosphere of the entire workplace, reducing productivity. Suzune: In order to avoid such things, it's therefore important for me to have a clear understanding of my coworkers' interpersonal relationships. Mei: Oh. I think I get that... Mei: ...... Mei: Did you really need to invite everyone else here for that, though? Suzune: Nope. Mei: What? Suzune: I just thought it'd be funner with more people. Mei: Seriously? Suzune: I won't deny that I'm doing this for amusement, but I also want to support you. Suzune: All you guys feel that way too, right? Natsume: Well, half that, and half out of curiosity. Kanna: I came 100\\% out of curiosity. Nozomi: In that case, I came 100\\% to support you! Suzune: See? Mei: Oh, uh... Thanks? Natsume: To be honest, like Suzune-san said, I want to know how things are going between you two as well--even though it's not really any of my business. Natsume: The cafe is just a really important place to me, so I'd hate for there to be any problems caused by interpersonal relationships. Natsume: Maybe I'm just a cynic, but I feel like it's all too easy for office romances to lead to those sorts of conflicts. Mei: Romance? Umm... I had a feeling that's where this was going, but, like... Natsume: Am I wrong? Mei: I don't think things between me and him are... like that. Kanna: You don't sound very confident. Mei: I mean, I don't have any experience with relationships, so I don't really know... Suzune: It definitely seems like you've got chemistry, though. From what I've seen, at least. Mei: Chemistry? Kanna: I agree. You become much more animated when you're talking with Takamine-san compared to when you talk with us. Mei: I-Is that true? I've never realized that myself... Natsume: I'd go so far as to say your eyes start to sparkle... maybe? Well, you get the idea. Suzune: You always go \"Senpai, Senpai!\" in such a cheerful voice. Whenever you're with Kousei, you seem even more upbeat than usual. Mei: What? Seriously? Natsume: What do you think, Sumizome-san? Have you noticed any recent changes in Takamine-kun's behavior? Nozomi: Hmm... I don't know. They definitely get along well, that's for sure. Nozomi: Ah--but I guess he seems a lot more... relaxed whenever he's around Mei-chan. Compared to Natsume-san and Kanna-san, for example. Natsume: True. He won't even sit beside me in class. Nozomi: Not a surprise. He's not really used to dealing with girls. Nozomi: But when he's with Mei-chan, I feel like he's more comfortable acting natural. Natsume: Hmm. I guess part of it might have to do with her being younger. Suzune: Not all the time, though. Yesterday he was all restless and fidgety. Mei: What? He was? Suzune: Yep. He was having a bit of trouble concentrating on work. Suzune: It made me smile, but he also kind of needed to get his act together. Suzune: So in all seriousness, the sooner you two sort out your feelings, the happier I'll be. Mei: Urk... Easier said than done... Kanna: It's almost Valentine's Day too. The timing couldn't be better. Nozomi: Oh, Valentine's Day! Are we doing anything special at the cafe? Natsume: Hopefully. Suzune-san and I are still figuring out what, though. Suzune: We'll probably do another limited-time special like we did on Christmas. I doubt it'll be as hectic this time around, though. Nozomi: True. People don't usually buy their Valentine's chocolates from cake shops. Suzune: If only chocolate had a longer shelf life. But yeah, that's why it's just going to be a limited-time thing, for girls to buy for their acquaintances and such. Suzune: You know, friend-chocolate. Kanna: Oh, that's right! I nearly forgot to ask. What should we do about OUR chocolates? Natsume: You mean for Takamine-kun? Kanna: Yes. And Mikado-san too. I wasn't sure if we should give our male coworkers chocolates. Nozomi: Why don't we give them one big gift, from all of us? That way it'll be easier for them to prepare a return gift too, as opposed to having to buy a gift for each of us individually. Natsume: Good idea. He'd probably be disappointed if we didn't get him anything. Suzune: In that case, Mei-san can get him something a little more personal. Mei: Gosh, why do we keep going here? Suzune: Well, it's either that or you pitch in with the rest of us. Which do you want? Mei: Well... I mean... Urk... Suzune: See? You don't want to, do you? Mei: Well, I mean... he does a lot for me, so, like... Mei: If I'm going to give him something... I want it to be from ME. Natsume: That's the only reason? Mei: Urk... Kanna: Oh? You're not denying it. Mei: I don't know what you want me to say... Mei: Ngh! Mei: I really don't know. I mean, I do l-like him, of course... Mei: But I just like him as a person... I don't know if that means I l-love him or not. Suzune: Ahhh! So adorbs! My heart can't take it! Natsume: God, what's gotten into you? Are you drunk? Suzune: A little. Kanna: Let me ask you this then. If Takamine-san started getting chummy with another girl, how would that make you feel? Mei: Hmm... Natsume: Out of all of us, I'd say he's closest to Sumizome-san, right? Nozomi: I guess, considering how long we've known each other. Suzune: Do you ever feel like there's a side of him only you know about? Nozomi: Something only I know? Let me think... Nozomi: His face when he wakes up, I guess? Kanna: You're not talking about what I think you are, are you? Nozomi: No, not like that. He gets up early by himself now, but I used to have to come over every morning to wake him up. Suzune: Ahh. I have a younger brother too, so I know what that's like. He'd always whine and yell when I yanked off his covers. Nozomi: Yeah... I once made the mistake of doing that too... Natsume: Why was it a mistake? Nozomi: You know how in the morning, guys get... um, you know... Suzune: Morning wood? Nozomi: Oh my god! You just outright said it! Mei: Morning what? Suzune: It's when guys get an uncontrollable erection in the morning. Mei: ...... Mei: Ahh! Suzune: Gee, what an adorable reaction. Nozomi-san, on the other hand, seems like she's pretty used to it. Nozomi: I wouldn't really say that. I've just happened to see it a few times, is all... Suzune: Oh-ho. So you've seen his erect ding-a-ling \"a few times,\" have you now? Natsume: His what? Kanna: She's definitely drunk, alright. Nozomi: I-It wasn't on purpose or anything, okay? It just happened on rare occasions when I came to wake him up... Suzune: Well, how does it feel knowing another woman's seen his, um... his wing-dang-doodle, Mei-san? Natsume: Excuse me? Kanna: You're a terrible drunk, Suzune-san. Suzune: Go ahead and tell us. Another woman's seen his private parts. How does that make you feel? Mei: Urk... Mei: Ngh... Mei: Nghhh! Mei: ...... Mei: It makes me feel... a little put out... I guess. Suzune: So you do have some feelings for him, deep down. Mei: Urk... I don't know... Suzune: Well, if you're planning to make him some homemade chocolate, let me know. I'll teach you everything you need to know. Mei: Homemade? But that'd totally make it seem like I... you know. Natsume: Like you're confessing to him, right. Mei: He might think I'm being too clingy, though... Nozomi: I don't know about that. I think he'd be thrilled. Suzune: So what do you say? Wanna make some homemade chocolate? Mei: Homemade chocolate... to confess my feelings... Homemade chocolate... Mei: Urk... Nghhhh! Mei: Ngh. Nozomi: M-Mei-chan? Natsume: She collapsed. Kanna: Her face is red as a beet too. Mei: I can't think straight anymore... My head's about to explode... Suzune: Aww, look at her. Acting all flustered like a young girl in love. Natsume: I feel like it's mostly your fault she's like this. Suzune: Sorry, she's just too cute. I can't help but tease her. Mei: Please, just let me go home already... I'm really not good with these sorts of conversations... Kanna: I know I said I only came because I was curious, but if you really are planning to confess to Takamine-san, I'll be glad to assist in any way I can. Kanna: I'd love for you two to be happily together. Nozomi: Me too! Let me know if there's anything I can do. Natsume: Alright. I think it's time we put this conversation to rest. It doesn't look like Hiuchidani-san can take much more. Mei: I can't... I'm about to die from embarrassment... Suzune: Man, what I wouldn't give to be young again... Kanna: What are you talking about? You're still plenty young. Suzune: There's a world of difference between being a student and being a working adult. Suzune: Time'll pass by before you know it, Mei-san. Make sure you don't leave any regrets behind. Mei: Urk... Alright. I'll try to think about how I really feel... Suzune: Honestly, though, it's already pretty clear to the rest of us. Kanna: That's just how love works. The person themselves can oftentimes be oblivious to the fact. Natsume: Very true. Nozomi: You three talk like you know a lot. You must have a ton of dating experience, huh? All Three: ...... Nozomi: Why did you all look away? Do you... not? Natsume: Anyway, why don't we start discussing our Valentine's Day menu? Suzune: Sounds like a great idea! Kanna: Indeed! Nozomi: Oops... I guess I shouldn't have asked. Mei: Urk... Mei: Do I really like him... that way? Mei: ...... Mei: Urk... I don't know! Ngh! Mei: G-Good morning! Kousei: What did you do to her yesterday? Suzune: Nothing. We just had a little chat. Kousei: ...... Suzune: Why are you giving me that look? Kousei: Because she's clearly acting weird. Suzune: Well, it's obvious why... Suzune: ...... Kousei: What do you mean? Suzune: Well, maybe I do owe her an apology. Kousei: What? Suzune: I might've teased her a little too much. Kousei: Huh? Suzune: Well, thankfully, we might see some progress now. Kousei: What progress? Suzune: You'll see soon enough. And you'd better thank me when it happens. Kousei: When what happens? Suzune: Uh-oh. Our orders are starting to pile up. Better get back to work. Kanna: Actually, Takamine-san, could I ask you and Mei-san to stay behind for a little while? Mei: Huh? Suzune: Hold on. What are you doing? Kanna: This doesn't have anything to do with what we discussed yesterday. I just need to talk to them about their shifts. Suzune: Oh, okay. Suzune: Well, see you all tomorrow! Natsume: Bye, everyone. Kanna: No, of course not. Kousei: I thought so. This is about Hiuchidani-san's eye, isn't it? Mikado: Yes, indeed. Mei: I forgot to ask before, but does anyone at the cafe else know about my eye? Mikado: Natsume knows. Suzune and Nozomi do not, however. Mei: Natsume-san san knows too? That's a relief. Kanna: Still, I must advise you not to speak with her about it too carelessly. We wouldn't want anyone overhearing you by accident. Mei: Alright. Mikado: How are things going with your eye? Mei: Nothing much has changed. Mikado: Which means you haven't found a way to release your butterflies yet? Mei: Err... No, not yet. Kanna: We haven't had many opportunities to practice, after all. Would you like to do some now? Mei: Sure. Mei: But that being said... Mikado: You said you are able to capture butterflies simply by staring at them, correct? Mei: Yeah. After I stare at them for a while, they just disappear. Kanna: In that case, perhaps you could do the opposite, and try staring at an empty space while imagining them appearing. Mei: Imagine them appearing? Mei: Nghhh... Mei: ...... Mei: It's not working. Kousei: What about other people who had the eye? How did they release their butterflies? Mikado: Well, if we knew that, we would not be having this problem. Kousei: Good point. But haven't any other Grim Reapers documented it? Kanna: We've tried searching for more information, but no such luck. Kanna: And to the best of my knowledge, Mei-san is the only person who possesses the eye yet can't see the butterflies. Kousei: So she's an anomaly? Mikado: We don't know that either. People who possess the eye are rare enough in and of themselves. There is simply not enough information. Mikado: That is precisely what makes her such an interesting case study. Kousei: You make her sound like some kind of guinea pig... Mei: That's okay. I want to find out everything I can about my eye as well. Mei: If anything, I should be the one apologizing for being so unhelpful... Kanna: If only I could use my scythe to retrieve the butterflies from your eye... Kousei: You can't? Kanna: I don't dare try. It could end up causing unforeseen damage to Mei-san's soul. Kanna: Perhaps if I knew exactly where the butterflies were located, I might be able to do something about it, but I don't. Mikado: We are no longer able to sense butterflies that have been captured by the eye. Mikado: That is why we did not realize that Mei possessed the eye in the first place. Kousei: Interesting. Kanna: I just had an idea, Mei-san. Mei: Yes? Kanna: Whenever you capture butterflies, is there anything in particular that you think of? Mei: Something I think of? Hmm... I'm not really sure... Kanna: So you do it without thinking? Mei: Well... I guess I think to myself, \"Go away!\" or something like that. Mei: But the very first time I ever noticed a wisp... Mei: ...... Mei: I was mostly just curious. \"What is that?\" I thought, and so I kept staring at it until it disappeared. Mei: That's what crossed my mind the first time it happened, at least. Kanna: Just curiosity... Kousei: So then if she does the opposite, and tries NOT to think about the butterflies, she'll be able to release them? Mikado: You realize that, until just recently, she had no idea that there were even butterflies inside her? Kousei: Oh, right. I guess she hasn't been thinking about them this whole time. I wonder what it is she needs then? Kanna: Maybe what she needs is... something more concrete. Mei: What do you mean? Kanna: If, by thinking about \"butterflies\", you are able to capture them... Kanna: Then perhaps by focusing your thoughts on a specific \"place\", you'll be able to release them. Mei: Oh. So instead of just vaguely trying to release them anywhere, I should try to think about releasing them towards someplace specific? Kanna: Why don't you give it a shot? Mei: Alrighty! Mei: Ngh... Mei: Nghh! Mei: C'mon, the chair... The chair! Mei: Nggghhhhh! Mikado: It doesn't seem to be working. Mei: I'm sorry... Kanna: Maybe you aren't focusing hard enough... or maybe I'm just completely wrong. Kanna: Hmm... Kanna: Your Excellency. Mikado: Yes? Kanna: Please turn into your cat form. Mikado: I beg your pardon? Kanna: Please turn into your cat form. Mikado: I refuse. Kanna: Please turn into your cat form. Mikado: You can repeat yourself however many times you wish, but no means no! Kanna: Please! I'm sure this will work! Remember that Mei-san has an abnormal fixation with cats. Mikado: I will not! Mei: A-Abnormal fixation? That's mean... Kousei: Well... she's not wrong. Mei: You too, Senpai?! Kousei: I mean... you turn pretty crazy whenever you see a cat. Kanna: To put it bluntly, you turn into a complete maniac. Mei: W-Wow! You're so mean! Kanna: We've got nothing to lose by trying. Please, Your Excellency! This is for Mei-san's sake! Mikado: Kgh... Very well. But you had best keep yourself under control this time, Mei. Mei: Don't worry! I will, I promise! Mikado: I do not believe you! Kanna: Please, Your Excellency. Hurry it up! Mikado: Fine... Have your wish! Mei: Ahhhhhhh! Mikado: Mei! Have you already forgotten your promise?! Mei: R-R-Relax! I-I'm fine! I-I'm completely calm! Kousei: That look in your eyes begs to differ... Kanna: This is just a guess... but Mei-san seems like the kind of person stray cats run from. Mei: How did you know? It's true; even cats that are used to people always run away from me! I wonder why? Mikado: Is it not painfully obvious? Kanna: Now then, Mei-san. Please try imagining your butterflies being released around His Excellency. Mei: R-Right! A-Around His Excellency! Y-Yes! O-Of course! Mikado: I do not wish to be rude, Mei, but I find your behavior most repulsive right now. Kousei: That's about as rude as it gets, though. Mei: I don't mind! He can call me repulsive as much as he wants! Kousei: You've got problems, Hiuchidani-san. Seriously. Mei: A-Anyway, here I go! Mikado: Very well. But you can do it standing from there. Do not come any closer, you hear? Mei: A-Alright! *pant*... *pant*... Mikado: ...... Mei: *pant*... *pant*! Mikado: Why are you breathing so heavily? Mei: *PANT*... *PANT*! Mikado: Enough! If this goes on any further, I will not be safe! Mei: *PAAAANT*! Kanna: Alright, Mei-san. Settle down, settle down. Mei: Huh? It's over? My time's up already? Wait! How much do I have to pay for an extension?! Mikado: What on earth is this child talking about? Kousei: Well, I guess that didn't work either. Kanna: My idea must've been wrong. I suppose we'll have to think this over some more. Mei: Five thousand yen! I'll pay five thousand yen! Mikado: That is quite enough. Playtime is over. Mei: Ahh... He's gone... Mikado: Good grief. I am beginning to suspect that this derangement of yours is a side effect of using your eye... Mei: What do you mean? I was totally calm and collected. Kousei: ...... Kanna: ...... Mikado: I believe you have something to say to me, Mei. Mei: Okay, fine! I'm sorry! Kanna: Anyway, why don't we stop here for today? Mikado: Before we do, though, I must ask. Have you captured any other butterflies lately besides the ones in the cafe? Mei: No. I haven't used my powers at all outside of the cafe. Mikado: Alright. Very well. Kanna: If that's all, then we'll see you-- Mei: Actually, can I ask one more thing? Mikado: Yes? Mei: Is it possible that using my eye... could have a negative effect on the person? Kanna: You mean when you use it to capture butterflies? Mei: Yeah. You said that it had the power to heal people's souls, but, um... how do I put this... Kousei: For example, if a person's soul was weakened because of a physical problem, healing their soul wouldn't resolve the underlying issue. Kousei: On the contrary, healing only their soul might have a negative effect on their body. Kousei: I think that's what Hiuchidani-san means to say. Mei: R-Right. That's it. Thank you. Mikado: Hmm... It is difficult to say for certain. Mei: In that case, isn't it kind of risky for me to be using my eye on our customers? Mikado: Perhaps. But it is also better than doing nothing. Mikado: There have been no instances of any customers returning to the cafe with new butterflies after you captured their old ones. Mikado: As of this moment, we have no reason to believe that the power of your eye has any negative effect on others. Mei: Oh... Kanna: Did something happen that caused you to think that it might? Mei: N-No, not exactly... Mei: ...... Mei: It's just... I feel like I've been getting a little carried away ever since I learned the truth about my eye, and learned that there were other people that understood me. Mei: If it turns out that my eye is causing others harm, though... I'd rather just stop using it altogether. Mikado: It is I who tasked you with capturing other people's butterflies. If there truly are any negative consequences of doing so, it would be my responsibility to bear. Mikado: So do not worry. Thanks to you, our job of collecting butterflies has been going remarkably smoothly. That is a fact. Mei: Okay. Thank you for saying that. Kanna: Are there any other questions you'd like to ask? Mei: No, that's all. Kanna: In that case, I'll see you both tomorrow. Good night. Mikado: Good night. Make sure you get plenty of rest. Mei: We will. Good night! Kousei: Good night. Kanna: ...... Mikado: Are you still worried? Kanna: I'm a little relieved, actually, knowing that Mei-san has her own reservations about using her eye. Mikado: I've never been worried about that myself. Despite appearances, she is a very rational-- Mikado: ...... Kanna: Struggling to finish that sentence, aren't you? Mikado: Allow me to rephrase. Although she tends to lose her head under certain circumstances, she is generally a very compassionate person. Mikado: She is the sort of person who would never even think about abusing the power of her eye. Kanna: I'm not worried about that either. I trust Mei-san completely. Kanna: What worries me is... something else. Mikado: We've already warned her many times not to let anyone realize the truth about her eye. Kanna: I know. Of course, times have changed now, but still... Mikado: People's hearts remain largely the same. Kanna: That's why I was against using her eye in the first place. Kanna: There may not be any problems right now, but if things start to fall apart, Mei-san will be the one to suffer. Kanna: And all the positive influence she's been having on Takamine-san's soul will be for naught. Kanna: If anything were to happen to Mei-san, Takamine-san would undoubtedly be greatly affected as well. Mikado: Hmm. So it is not Mei, but Takamine Kousei you are worried about? Kanna: I'm worried about them both. But... I realize I may just be feeling overprotective. Kanna: If you wish for her to have full control over the power of her eye, I won't object. Rest assured. Mikado: I understand that you are concerned, but we cannot allow these butterflies to simply remain inside of Mei either. Kanna: I know. Mikado: Incidentally, Kanna. Kanna: Yes? Mikado: What exactly was it that you and Mei spoke about yesterday? I understand you and the others had a \"girls' night out.\" Kanna: Tsk, tsk. How rude, Your Excellency. You mustn't ask a young lady to divulge her secrets. Mikado: Ah. So it was nothing of importance then. Kanna: Nihihi. Nope. Just a little gossip between girls, is all. Kanna: I do hope everything works out between those two, though... Mei: Oh... yeah. It's been weighing on my mind for a while now. Mei: The truth is, I've been getting a little carried away ever since His Excellency gave me this task. Mei: I'm worried that I've only been adding to people's troubles, like I did to her. Mei: I was starting to question whether capturing our customer's wisps was the right thing to do. Kousei: Hmm... It's hard to say. Mei: Yeah. It is. Kousei: But you know, I've been thinking as well. Kousei: I suggested that maybe this friend of yours had a physical problem, and that's why she still hasn't gotten better. Kousei: But after you'd cast your \"magic spell\" on her, you saw a significant improvement in her mood, didn't you? Mei: Yeah. While I wouldn't say she recovered completely, there was definitely a big improvement. Kousei: If that's true, then it must be some sort of emotional problem. That's why the power of your eye was able to cheer her up temporarily. Kousei: And in that case, there's no doubt in my mind that your \"magic spell\" provided her with some much-needed relief. Kousei: While it's unfortunate that she ended up becoming overly dependent on it, it's clear that the weight in your friend's heart was lightened because of you. Kousei: If I had to say whether it was the right or wrong decision, I'd have to say it was right. Kousei: So I don't think there's anything you should feel guilty or anxious about. Kousei: The power in your left eye is unmistakably a power that helps others. And I'm certain it'll help a lot more people from now on. Mei: ...... Kousei: Uh... sorry. Maybe it's not my place to say anything. Mei: N-No, don't apologize... Mei: ...... Mei: C-Can you read my mind, Senpai? Kousei: Huh? Mei: It makes me really happy... You always seem to know exactly what I want to hear. Mei: It almost feels like you know exactly what I'm thinking all the time. Kousei: Nah... I'm not that sensitive, to be honest. In fact, I can be downright insensitive sometimes. Kousei: But one thing I will say is that I'm not saying these things just to cheer you up. Kousei: I mean it. All of it. Kousei: The stuff about me being grateful to you, and the stuff about your eye--you, helping other people. Kousei: I mean all of it, from the bottom of my heart. Kousei: And if I managed to get that message across to you, well... then that'd make me happy too. Mei: ...... Kousei: Sorry if I seem like I'm trying too hard to be cool or something. I'm lame, I know. Mei: N-No! You're really not... Mei: ...... Mei: U-Umm! Kousei: Hm? Mei: Do you like sweets, Senpai? Kousei: Huh? What's this about? Mei: Do you? Kousei: Well, sure, I guess. Mei: Okay, great! Good night! Kousei: Huh? O-Oh. Yeah, g'night. Mei: Thanks for walking me home! See you tomorrow! Kousei: R-Right. See you tomorrow... Mei: ...... Mei: Hi, Suzune-san? It's me, Mei. I'm sorry for the random call... Mei: Um, I was wondering something... Mei: ...... Mei: C-Could you teach me how to make my own chocolate? ",
            "Somei: I'll try to be more positive. I feel like people tend to worry too much about contacting old friends, only to find out it's no big deal once they actually do it. Kousei: True. Somei: Don't you have to get back to work, though? Kousei: Oh, crap! I forgot! Somei: Speaking of the cafe, I wouldn't say no to a slice of cake next time you visit! Kousei: Well, I guess. But I thought you were about to be discharged soon? Somei: Yeah, I am. Kousei: In that case, you might as well come by the cafe yourself. Somei: Ahh, sure. I'll think about it. Kousei: By the way, do you think I could get your phone number? Somei: Oh-ho! And you said you're not a cheater. She's not gonna be happy to hear this! Kousei: Please don't joke about that. She can be seriously scary when she gets mad. Somei: Why do you want my number then? Oh, are you gonna introduce me to one of your guy friends? Kousei: Hmm. Well, if you're serious, I guess I could introduce you to one of my college buddies. Somei: Wait. Seriously? Kousei: Sure, it's not that big of a deal. Kousei: I won't ask you to do anything for me in return... but maybe you'd be willing to give me some advice? Natsume: How does kissing feel so good? All we're doing is putting our lips together... Natsume: If this is what kissing feels like, then... Female Nurse: Oh? Has your boyfriend already left? Natsume: He came here during his break at work, so he couldn't stay long. Female Nurse: You're a lucky girl. Not many guys would come see their girlfriend every day of the week. Natsume: ...... Female Nurse: Oh, no need to blush. Female Nurse: There's no reason a pretty girl like you shouldn't have a man or two around her arm. You might not think it, but I was quite the playgirl back in my younger days. Natsume: I'm fine with just the one, actually. Female Nurse: Oh, you're more pure-hearted than I expected. Natsume: Anyway, um... there's something I'd like to ask. Female Nurse: What's that? Natsume: If I leave the hospital tomorrow as scheduled, will I be able to go back to my life as usual? Female Nurse: Well, yes. Natsume: So I should be able to take hot baths, and engage in a bit of... ph-physical activity? Female Nurse: That shouldn't be a problem. But it'll also depend on what kind of physical activity you... Female Nurse: Ahh. So THAT'S what you mean. Female Nurse: Most girls your age are interested in those things, all the more so if they have a boyfriend. Heck, back in my younger days, I-- Natsume: Ngh! Female Nurse: Well, maybe another time. But I get it--you can't exactly ask Dr. Miyama a question like that. Alright. I'll try to ask him for you as discreetly as I can. Natsume: I'd, um, appreciate that... Female Nurse: Oh, how I wish I was young like you again. Kousei: ...... Suzune: Try relaxing a bit more, will you? Kousei: Easier said than done. I can't help but worry. Kanna: Did the tests come back okay? Kousei: Yeah, that's what she texted me. Said she was clear to be discharged today. Suzune: Alright. The caprese-style pasta's ready to go out. Kanna: I'll take it. Kanna: Here is your caprese-style pasta. I'll bring you your sachertorte and blend coffee once you've finished. Kanna: Please, enjoy your meal. Mikado: Welcome to Cafe Stella. Hm? Ah, if it isn't Shiki Natsume. Natsume: Hello. Mei: Huh? Oh, it's Natsume-senpai! Welcome back! Nozomi: Welcome back! Natsume: Oh, I didn't know you two were working today. Nozomi: They needed some extra help till you got back. Mei: Plus, we wanted to be here to see you! Boy, I ran here as fast as I could once school let out. Natsume: Ah. Thanks for doing that. Mei: Oh, you don't have to thank us for that! Ahaha. Mei: We've missed you a whole lot this past week. Nozomi: Since they let you out, does that mean you're all good to go now? Natsume: Yeah. I'm fine. Nozomi: Are you sure? You weren't in the hospital for as long as I thought you'd be. Kanna: Health and sickness start with the mind, after all. I'm sure those daily visits from a certain somebody did wonders to speed her recovery. Nozomi & Mei: Ahh. Natsume: You didn't have to say that out loud. Kanna: Welcome back, Natsume-san. Mikado: Welcome back. Natsume: Thanks. I'll be able to get back to work by tomorrow. Mei: What? So soon? You can rest up a little longer, if you need to. Nozomi: Yeah. If you need any help settling back into things, just ask! We're all here for you! Natsume: I will. Thank you, everyone. Kanna: But that's enough about work. You're here as a customer today, aren't you? Mei: Table for one, Miss? Suzune: Ah, look who it is. I had a feeling that's what all the commotion was about. Suzune: Welcome back, Natsume-san. Natsume: Mhm. I'm glad to be back. Kousei: Make it non-alcoholic, please. Bartender: Certainly. Kousei: You okay after all that? I'm surprised you don't have heartburn. Natsume: A small price to pay. Humans can't live without eating good food. Kousei: You seem like you're in a good mood. Natsume: Maybe it's because I just got out of the hospital, but everything tasted so delicious. Kousei: Because... of me? Natsume: Nope. Not quite. Natsume: Not just because of you, but because of everyone. Kousei: You mean everyone at the cafe? Natsume: Yeah. I don't want to sound like I'm still hung up on this, though. Kousei: Don't worry. I'm here to listen. Natsume: See, years ago, whenever I was released from the hospital... people would always stare at me from a distance. Natsume: They didn't exactly treat me like I was helpless, but they always seemed confused, like they didn't know what to say to me. Natsume: And that's why... Bartender: Here you are, ma'am. Kousei: Stop joking about that. Kousei: If it turns out there's actually alcohol in there, I'm going to start worrying about you again. Natsume: Okay, okay. Sorry. I'll stop for today. Kousei: Alright. Let's get you home now. Natsume: ...... Kousei: Natsume? Natsume: Nothing... Kousei: Okay? Kousei: Oh, yeah. Finals are coming up. You feeling confident? You've been pretty busy lately, so you probably haven't had much time to study. Natsume: Well, I'm sure I'll manage. Kousei: Why don't we study together sometime for the class we share? Natsume: Sure. I don't mind. Kousei: ...... Natsume: ...... Kousei: ...... Kousei: What's the matter? Kousei: ...... Kousei: Haha, very funny. I thought I told you to stop joking ar-- Natsume: I'm not joking. And I'm not drunk either. Kousei: ...... Natsume: I want to stay with you... a bit longer... Kousei: Ah, er, sorry. Yeah... Kousei: I just never expected this, so my mind's kinda going haywire right now. So, um... Kousei: Alright. Kousei: I want to be with you too, Natsume. Kousei: *pant*... *pant*... Kousei: ...... Kousei: Nghhh! Kousei: *inhale*... *exhale*... *inhale*... *exhale*... *inhale*... Kousei: %123;*choke*?! Kousei: Er, no. 'Course not. Kousei: *inhale*... *exhale*... Kousei: You look really sexy. Natsume: Ngh... Kousei: Err, sorry. That was supposed to be a compliment. Y-You're not mad, are you? Natsume: No, I'm not. It's just... incredibly embarrassing. Kousei: You really look beautiful, though. Positively stunning. I'm getting turned on just looking at you. Kousei: My bad. Kousei: But, err, instead of that... Kousei: Can I... touch you? Natsume: Are you really going to ask me that now? Take a hint. Kousei: Yeah. Sorry. Natsume: It's my first time, so we need to do a bit more foreplay first. You know, kissing, stuff like that... Kousei: R-Right. Sorry. Kissing... Nhh... Natsume: I wasn't saying for you to kiss me down THERE! Kousei: Huh? Natsume: Why are you surprised?! Is this really news to you?! There's an order to this stuff! Kousei: O-Oh. Sorry. You're right. First things first. Kousei: Please tell me your name and age. Natsume: What am I, interviewing for the casting couch? Natsume: Oh, for crying out loud. You totally ruined the mood now. Natsume: I hope you know how humiliating this is for me. Kousei: I'm sorry. I mean it. I apologize. Kousei: But you gotta understand; this is my first time too! I'm freaking out here! Natsume: Then make it up to me. Nhh... Natsume: Nhhh... Nh, mh... Nhh... Ah... That's the first time. Kousei: Huh? Natsume: The first time you've ever initiated a kiss. Kousei: Yeah, I guess so. Kousei: I'd better pay you back for all the times you've kissed me then... Nhh... Natsume: Ahmph... Hngh... *smack* *kiss*... Nhh... Nh... *kiss* *smooch*... Mhh... Kousei: No, they're perfect. And... super soft. Natsume: Ahh, nhh... Hngh... Nhhh... Kousei: Besides, it doesn't matter whether they're big or small. I don't care about size. Natsume: Is that supposed to be a compliment? Kousei: I dunno, to be honest. I think your boobs might be hypnotizing me. Kousei: They're so soft... and your nipples are such a beautiful pink too... It's really turning me on. Natsume: Well, um, I'm glad to hear it. Kousei: ...... Natsume: Stop staring at me in silence, will you? It's embarrassing. Kousei: Sorry, I didn't mean to. Kousei: *lick* *suck*... Your nipples are delicious, Natsume... Natsume: *pant* *pant*... It didn't hurt... Nhh... *pant*... Natsume: I just didn't expect it to feel this electrifying... *pant*... *pant*... Natsume: What's going to happen to me... if we go even further? Kousei: I don't know either. Kousei: But... I'm past the point of return. Kousei: It's... so pretty... Kousei: Well, I need to get a good look. Kousei: Don't wanna put it in the wrong hole, y'know... Natsume: Yeah, but... It doesn't look weird, does it? Kousei: It's beautiful. Seriously. That's the only word that comes to mind. Kousei: Is that not convincing enough for you? Natsume: No, I never said that... *pant* *pant*... *pant*... Urk... You're just staring so hard... Kousei: ...... Natsume: And now you go all quiet on me again. Kousei: Ah, err, sorry. I'm not doing it on purpose. I just can't tear my eyes away... Natsume: *pant*... *pant*... *pant*... *pant*... Kousei: Your vagina's so amazing. Natsume: Huh? What do you mean? Does it look weird? Kousei: No, of course not. Kousei: It's just, this is my first time doing any of this... All I can say is, it's amazing. Natsume: R-Really? Umm, how else would you describe it? Kousei: Let's see... Natsume: Delicious? What are you... N-No, wait. You're... Don't tell me you're... Ahh! Kousei: Nhh... *smooch* Natsume: Ngghhh?! Kousei: Your pussy? Natsume: Ngh! Don't say it outright! Natsume: You didn't hate putting your mouth on my p-pu... did you? You don't have to force yourself. Kousei: I don't hate it one bit. I love every part of you, Natsume. If anything, I want to lick it even more. Kousei: What about you, though? Do you not want me to lick it? Natsume: It's just... embarrassing. That's the worst part... but I don't mind it. Kousei: Alright. In that case... Natsume: Ahh?! Nghh... Mhh... Urk... Ahh! Kousei: *lick* *lick*... *slurp* Natsume: S-Sto... Not there... Ahh! It's too embarrassing... being licked there... Nhh! Natsume: Ah, *pant* *pant*... Do people usually have to go this far? Kousei: *lick... Not that I'd know... but I'm pretty sure this is a normal part of foreplay. Natsume: I'm just a little worried that you're getting most of your information from porn. Kousei: Well, judging from your reactions, it seems like you like this. Natsume: I mean... Kousei: Can I keep kissing you down here? I want to taste you even more, Natsume. Natsume: You promise you'll stop? Kousei: Sure... If I can pump the brakes in time. Kousei: But sorry in advance if I can't stop myself. I'm already on the verge of losing control as is. Kousei: *lick*... *lick* *slurp*... *kiss* *kiss*... *suck*... Natsume: Ahhh... Ahh, ah, ah... ahhh... Eeek?! Natsume: Ahhh?! Ahh... ah, ah, ah, ahhh! Kousei: I just tried focusing my kisses on a specific spot... *kiss* *suck* *kiss* *lick*... Natsume: Ahhh! W-Wait, not there... Noooo! My body's... tingling so much... Ahhh! Kousei: Nhh... Does it hurt? Natsume: It doesn't hurt, but I'm scared of how much my body's tingling. Kousei: Does that mean you want me to stop? Natsume: No, but... *pant* *pant*... A-Are you going to keep kissing me? Kousei: I thought you said you were scared? Natsume: I... I am... but you want to keep going, don't you? Kousei: Of course. But if you don't want me to, I won't; I'll stop here. Kousei: So tell me what you want, Natsume. Natsume: Urk... I-I know you already know what I'm going to say... Natsume: You're teasing me on purpose, aren't you? Kousei: That's not--completely untrue, I guess. Natsume: Nrgh... Kousei: But I don't want to do anything you don't like. That's the truth. Kousei: That's why I want you to say it clearly. Because once we go any further, I get the feeling I won't be able to stop myself. Natsume: Fine... Fine. Keep going. Natsume: I don't hate how much it tingles. It's a little scary, but I want you to keep going. Keep kissing me down there... Kousei: It's your own fault for being so wet down here. *lick* *lick* *kiss*... Natsume: Maybe, but you're definitely making those sounds on purpose... Ahhhh! Ah, ah, ah... ahh! Kousei: Wow... You just keep getting wetter and wetter... *lick* *smack*... Natsume: Ahhhh! I-I can't help it... You're kissing it in such a lewd way... Mhhhh! Kousei: I can be even lewder, you know. Natsume: Ah, ahh! Nooo... That's so dirty--ahh! Ahhh! Kousei: *suck* *slurp*... *lick* *lick*... *kiss*... Kousei: *kiss* *pant*... *pant*... *lick* *lick*... *kiss* *suck* Natsume: It feels, too good... I-I can't... *pant*... Hnghh! Natsume: What? *pant*... *pant*... S-Sorry... But if you keep kissing me like that, I... Hngghhh! Natsume: I can't, I can't, I can't... It feels too good! Ahhh, ahhh, eek! Kousei: Well, as long as I'm making you feel good, I'm happy... *suck* *lick*... Natsume: K-Keep... Keep licking my p-pu... that spot... Kiss it more. Kousei: *kiss*... *slurp* *suck*... Natsume: Ahhhhhh! Ah, ah, ahhh! Yes! That feels amazing... Ahhhhh! Kousei: Your reactions make me really happy, Natsume... *kiss* *lick* *lick*... *suck*... Natsume: Ah, ah! Nooo... No more... Ngh! I can't take this... Ahh! Natsume: S-Something's coming! Please, stop! Any more and I'll... Ah, ah, ahh! Kousei: Nhh... *suck* *slurp* *lick*... Natsume: Ahhh! I can't... I can't, I can't... ahh... I'm really gonna--! Natsume: Ah, ah, ahhhhhhhhhhhn! Kousei: You came, didn't you? Natsume: *pant*... *pant*... This is my first time... but I feel so happy... *pant* *pant* *pant* *pant*... Natsume: Wow... My head's gone all mushy... *pant* *pant*... Kousei: Should we take a little break? Natsume: Ngh... No... If we wait, I'll start getting scared again... Natsume: So let's keep going... Let's... have s-sex. Kousei: I haven't even put it in, though... Kousei: Wait--huh?! Don't tell me I just lost my virginity without even knowing it?! Natsume: Oh, hush, you idiot. That's not the only part of sex that feels good. Natsume: Just feeling each other's warmth like this... feels incredible... Kousei: Y-Yeah. Right, of course! Natsume: You're not listening to a word I'm saying, are you? Kousei: What do you want me to do? I'm just too excited about finally losing my virginity. Natsume: I mean, I get that, but still. Kousei: And I get to do it with the girl I love too. I couldn't be happier. Kousei: It's the only thing on my mind right now. Kousei: But you're sure about this, right? You want to go all the way with me? Natsume: Yeah. I want to go all the way. So hold me. Hold me tighter. Kousei: Sure thing. Natsume: It's a lot b-bigger than I thought... Kousei: I think I'm pretty average-sized, actually. Natsume: What?! R-Really? Kousei: Anyway... are you ready, Natsume? It's getting harder and harder to hold myself back. Natsume: I'm ready, but I want you to k-kiss me first. Kousei: I-In THIS position?! Natsume: No, you idiot. I don't mean down there... I mean a normal kiss. Nhh... Natsume: Ahh! *pant* *pant*... *pant*... M-My belly... feels so hot... Kousei: Ngh... Holy shit... Natsume: *pant* *pant*... I-It doesn't feel weird for you... does it? Kousei: Not at all. It feels amazing. Kousei: Your pussy is so warm, and the way it's sucking on me... it's squeezing me so tight. Kousei: And yet it's pulling me deeper still... I've never felt anything like this before. Seriously, it's amazing... Natsume: Me too... I've never... felt something so hot, so d-deep inside me before... Hngh... Kousei: Does it hurt? Natsume: A little bit, sure, but don't worry about me. And I doubt you're capable of stopping right now, right? Kousei: Yeah. Natsume: So I want you to kiss me instead. Make me forget about the pain. Keep me distracted. Kousei: Nhh... *kiss* Natsume: Urk... Nhh *kiss* *kiss*... *smooch*... *smack* *slurp*... Natsume: *pant* *pant*... *pant*... It doesn't hurt, so much as it feels strange... Natsume: Having this thing moving around inside of me is... *pant* *pant*... kind of amazing. Is it all the way inside? Kousei: Yeah. I think I'm all the way in. Kousei: I'm gonna start moving. Kousei: Nhh... *kiss* *smack*... Natsume: I love you... Ahhh... *kiss* *slurp*... I love you... *smooch* *swirl*... *kiss* *kiss*... Kousei: Am I moving too much for you? Natsume: N-No, I'm fine... *kiss*... Ahh, *pant* *pant*... It does hurt a little bit, but I can take it. Natsume: Ah, ah, ah... It hurts, but keep going... *pant* *pant*... What is this? Kousei: It makes me happy to know I'm making you feel good, Natsume. Natsume: It feels like I'm being split apart... like my insides are tingling... *pant*... It feels like it hurts, but it feels so good... Natsume: I-I'm... I'm not the only one feeling good, am I? Does it feel good for you? Kousei: Do you really need to ask? Your pussy feels incredible. It's making me go crazy. Natsume: Ahh?! Ah, hngh! N-Not so rough! Ah, ah, ah, ahh! Natsume: It's making... such a dirty sound! Nghhhh! Kousei: I think it's really hot, actually... You don't mind if I keep going, do you? *smooch* Natsume: Nghh... Mhh... *kiss* *kiss* *smack*... *lick* *smooch*... *kiss*... Kousei: I can't stop myself anymore, Natsume! Natsume: I can feel you... Mghh! Twitching, inside me... Nh, ngh! Stirring me up... Ah, ah, ah! Kousei: It feels way too good, kissing you up here and down there. Natsume: Ahhhh! Ah, ah, ah! You're kissing me... even deeper than before! Natsume: Hngh, ahhhh! Ahmph, *kiss* *smooch* *smack*... Nhh! Kousei: I love you, Natsume. I love you. Natsume: I love you too! Ah, ah, ahh... I love you, I love you! Natsume: It feels, so good... I want to stay like this forever... *kiss* *kiss*... *smack* *slurp*... Kousei: Natsume... If you keep kissing me like that... *smack* *kiss* *slurp*... Natsume: But it's distracting me from the pain... *kiss* *kiss* *smack*... *lick* *lick*... Kousei: Nhh! *kiss* *smooch*... *smack* Kousei: Does it hurt? Natsume: N-No... Something's... something's c-coming! It's coming... Ngghh! Natsume: It's my first time, but... Ahhhh! But I can't hold it back--ah! Ah, ah, ah, ah! Kousei: It makes me happier than anything to know that you're feeling good. In fact, it's turning me on even more. Natsume: Urk! At this rate, I'm gonna--mngh! *kiss* *smooch* *smooch* *smack*... *kiss* *kiss* Kousei: *kiss* Nh, mhh, nhh... Natsume: Ahh, I can't, I'm gonna... Ah, ah, ah! Hug me more! Tighter! Kousei: Natsume, I'm-- Natsume: Huh? W-Wait, I just... Ah?! Nooo... If you rub me right now, I'm gonna--! Natsume: Ngghhhh! Natsume: *pant* *pant*... I can't, I'm going crazy... *pant* *pant*... Kousei: Natsume... *kiss* Natsume: Mhhh, *smooch* *smack*... It's no use... Even if you kiss me, I... *smooch* *kiss* *kiss* *slurp*... Kousei: Hang in there. I'm about to cum too. Natsume: Ahhh! Ahh! Ahh! I'm gonna cum again! Kousei: Me too. This time, I'm gonna show you how I cum. Natsume: Show me... show me! I want to see you cum! Natsume: *pant* *pant*... Me too... I'm cumming again! Kiss me... kiss me! Kousei: *smooch* *kiss* *kiss* *smack*... *kiss* *smack*... Natsume: Nhhh! Ahh... *pant* *pant*... Ahmph, *kiss* *smooch* *slurp*! Kousei: Nhh, ahh... I'm cumming... Take it all! Natsume: I'll take it, I'll take it... So do it, inside--*kiss* *smack* *smack* *smooch*... Nhh, nghh! Kousei: Kh... ahh! I'm cumming, Natsume! Natsume: *smooch* *smooch* Nh, nhh, nhh, ngghhhh! Natsume: Nggggghhhhhhhhh! Natsume: Nh, nhh! Do it... I'm gonna cum again too! *kiss* *kiss* *smooch* *smooch*... Nhh, mhhhh! Kousei: Natsume! Natsume: *kiss* *kiss* *smack* *slurp* *smooch*... Nhhh, nh, ngghhhh! Natsume: Nggghhhhhhh! Kousei: Ngh, ahh... Natsume: *pant* *pant*... *pant*... I can hardly move... Kousei: Me too. Feels like I ejaculated every last bit of energy I had just now. Kousei: Just goes to show how turned on I was. And how much I love you. Natsume: Hey... I want another kiss... Kousei: Nhh... *kiss* *kiss*... *smooch*... Natsume: Mhh *smack*...

Where'd you meet this boyfriend of yours? Female Student B: What do you like about him anyway? Not that I'm trying to say he's bad--I'm just curious. Natsume: Kousei and I work at the same cafe. As for what I like about him... Natsume: Well, I enjoy being with him. Despite how he looks, he can also be pretty manly. But I guess I'd say the thing I like most about him is-- Student C: Is? Natsume: Honestly, I'm not sure. Natsume: But I love him a lot. All Three: Ahhh! Female Student B: Ohmigosh, you're SOOO adorable! Student C: You're head over heels for him, aren't you? Female Student A: So does that mean you're the one who asked him out? Natsume: Hmm. It's kind of hard to say. Technically, he's the one who confessed to me. Natsume: But I did kiss him before that. Student C: You kissed before you even started dating? Whoa, girl! Natsume: W-Well, you know. We were watching the sunrise on New Year's, and I got swept up in the moment... Female Student B: Oh, wow. So you two really haven't been going out for long. Student C: So did you guys do the deed outside after that kiss? Natsume: N-No, we didn't! Female Student B: Are you stupid? It's way too cold around this time of year to be having sex outdoors. Female Student A: So you're saying it'd be fine if it were summertime?! Student C: Sorry, Shiki-san! Are we making you uncomfortable? Natsume: No, not particularly... Female Student B: Wait. Are you still a virgin, by any chance? Female Student A: Oh my gosh! Have a little more tact, will you? Natsume: It's fine... Um, I'm not a virgin anymore. All Three: Whoa! Female Student A: You gotta tell us! How was it? Natsume: W-Well, it hurt. Student C: Not surprising. Natsume: But it felt good too. Female Student B: Really? Student C: Your boyfriend--um, Takamine-kun, was it? Has he been with a lot of other girls before you? Natsume: I doubt it. He said it was his first time too. Female Student B: Y'know, when I lost my virginity, I bled like hell. Female Student A: So the blood part is true? Student C: Wait, are you... Female Student A: Urk... Y-Yeah, I'm still a virgin! So what?! Female Student B: Hey, I never said there was anything wrong with that! Better to stay a virgin than to get impatient, throw it away, and end up with a crappy experience. Student C: Yep. You want your first time to be something memorable. Don't you agree, Shiki-san? Natsume: Huh? O-Oh, yeah. It definitely hurt, but it was a really wonderful experience. All Three: Whoa... Natsume: I-I mean, yeah, I agree--you shouldn't just throw away your virginity. Female Student A: A-Alright. I guess I'll just wait for the right guy to come along. Female Student A: Still, I'm kinda scared. Out of curiosity, how bad does it hurt? Female Student B: It's kinda hard to put into words, honestly. It was like an \"Eek!\" if that makes sense. Student C: For me, it was more like... \"Hngh!\" Female Student A: Pretty bad, I take it... Female Student A: What about you, Shiki-san? Natsume: For me, I guess it was only about an \"Ouch!\"... Female Student B: Lucky you. Female Student A: Is there some way to make it hurt less? Natsume: I have no idea. I'm not exactly an expert myself. Student C: Foreplay's probably the most important thing, don't you think? Student C: Then again, some guys have dicks so big it doesn't matter how wet you are. Female Student B: Yeah. Ultimately, it's gonna depend on your partner. Some guys are way too horny and wanna put it in without any foreplay, for example. Female Student A: What should I do if that happens? Student C: Hmm. You could make him cum once, and hopefully that calms him down some. Female Student A: Yeah, but how? Student C: With a handjob or a blowjob. Female Student A: A handjob? Natsume: A blowjob... Student C: You could also go for a thighjob, or an armpitjob--or get creative and go for a hairjob, a footjob, or even a shoulder-blade-job. Female Student B: Sheesh. You've done it all, haven't you? Wait--shoulder blades?! How does that even work?! Student C: What do you mean? You just--wait a minute. Student C: Are you interested in trying out some of this stuff too, Shiki-san? Natsume: Yesn't. Female Student A: What? Was that a yes or a no? Female Student B: Correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like a yes to me! Natsume: Have a good day. Kanna: Good job today, guys. Natsume: Yeah. You too. Suzune: It's been a while now since New Year's, but how are the numbers looking? Kanna: Thankfully, the number of customers hasn't declined in the slightest. Natsume: In fact, we might be getting even more than before, thanks to your Mont Blanc. Suzune: Wow, really? I'm glad all that effort paid off then. Kousei: Must've been a lot of work. Suzune: Well, y'know. It's not easy steaming chestnuts, hollowing them out, then straining them. And you gotta do everything by hand, otherwise the aroma and the texture just won't be the same. Kousei: Should I start coming to work a bit earlier to help out? Suzune: Wow. I thought you hated waking up early. Kousei: I do, but I can deal with it if you need the help. Suzune: Well, I kinda hate to ask you to... Kousei: Why's that? Suzune: You've seem kind of worn out these past few days, if you know what I mean. Kousei: ...... Kousei: I've, uh... been doing a lot of studying. My finals are coming up. Suzune: Well, as someone who lives in the same apartment building, let me give you a bit of advice. You might want to try keeping your voice down while you're \"studying.\" Kousei: ...... Natsume: Don't look at me, idiot. Her room is way too far away from yours; there's no way she'd be able to hear us. Kousei: Ah... Suzune: Hehehe. Well, all jokes aside. Suzune: I appreciate the offer, but I shouldn't be making other employees do extra work. If there's a problem, it's the system that needs to be improved. Kousei: You say that, but you're the one who always ends up doing the brunt of the work, Suzune-san... Suzune: Well, I guess that's just the price I pay for doing things my way. Either way, I shouldn't be pushing the responsibility onto the part-timers. Suzune: You've got exams coming up, don't you? Are you feeling confident about those? I wouldn't want to be responsible for your graduation being pushed back a year. Kousei: Don't worry. Despite what you may think of me, I do take my classes seriously. Natsume: I'm confident enough that I won't need to do any last-minute cramming either. Suzune: Great. Kanna: Still, let us know if you need time off. We'll do our best to handle things here on our own. Natsume: Thanks. I appreciate it. Kousei: So, where to today? Your place, or mine? Natsume: Hmm. Let's go to your place. I want to warm up under your kotatsu. Kousei: Alright. Kousei: I still have some hotpot ingredients leftover from last time too. Natsume: Sounds good. Let's have that. Kousei: Man, they were delicious. Natsume: If I make them, I'll probably end up making a lot, so let's save it for next time, and invite the others over. Kousei: Alright. Kousei: But speaking of which--what ever happened to that qipao you wore during New Year's? Natsume: What is it with you and your cosplay fetish? Kousei: I'm sorry, but you just looked way too cute in it. Kousei: Not to say that you don't normally look cute, because you do. Every day. Natsume: Alright, fine. I'll wear it for you next time, if I'm in the mood. Natsume: Phew. That was good. Kousei: Yep. Natsume: Here, let me clean up. Kousei: Nah, I'll do it today. Natsume: You sure? Well, how about I make us a cup of coffee or tea then? Kousei: Hmm. I could definitely go for a cup of coffee. Kousei: But all I have is the instant stuff. Natsume: Where is it? Kousei: Oh, it's on that shelf up there. The tea's up there too. Only tea bags, though. Natsume: Nope. I'm just waiting for the tea to steep. Kousei: You have to steep tea bags too? Natsume: You don't have to, but the tea's a lot more fragrant this way. Kousei: Huh. Well, I'll be waiting over here. Natsume: Okay. Kousei: Phew. Sure is cold tonight. Kousei: Rokurou-san did seem pretty happy with how things turned out. Natsume: What's that? Kousei: Nothing. Just talking to myself. Natsume: Oh. Well, here's your coffee. Kousei: Sorry I only have tea bags for you. Natsume: I don't really mind. Anyway, scooch over. I need to warm myself up too. Kousei: O-Oh, uh, okay... Kousei: Not much space, though. Natsume: What, do you want me to move? Kousei: I never said that. Kousei: You just don't, err, initiate this sort of... physical intimacy very often. Kousei: It's usually me who does it. Natsume: The only thing you initiate is se... sex, Kousei. Kousei: I won't deny that. But I do like cuddling like this too. Kousei: Especially when you're the one seeking it, Natsume. Natsume: Only because I love you. Natsume: There's nothing I enjoy more than being with my boyfriend. Being able to feel you right next to me is the most blissful thing ever. Kousei: Same for me. Natsume: I can tell. You've had that goofy grin on your face for a while now. , Mei: Good morning! Natsume: Good morning. Kanna: Good morning. How was yesterday? Mei: I'm sorry? Natsume: She's talking about your date with Takamine-kun. Mei: My... WHAT? Kanna: You went somewhere together, didn't you? Mei: W-Well, yeah... Natsume: He didn't do anything stupid, did he? Kanna: We were worried that he'd get too carried away and blow his chance. Natsume: Yeah. He seems like the kind of guy to get way too worked up over a date. Mei: Wait, what? What? Suzune: Whoa there. Don't go having this conversation without me! Mei: Ah... Suzune-san. Good morning. Suzune: Good morning. So? You guys were talking about yesterday? Natsume: Yes. Suzune: How was it? How far did you two go? Mei: H-How far? Kanna: Jumping straight into it, are we? Suzune: I know you're just as curious as I am. I mean, they've basically seen each other naked now, no? Mei: WHAT?! Natsume: Wait, really? You've already done THAT? Mei: Oh, no! No, no, no! I mean--WHAT?! Suzune: Okay, maybe that was a bit misleading. I just meant they've seen each other in swimsuits. Mei: A bit?! That was EXTREMELY misleading! Kanna: Oh... so you went swimming? At a hot spring? Mei: We went swimming, yes, but at a pool... Natsume: Really? I didn't know they were already open at this time of year. Suzune: I think she means the big one nearby. It's a heated indoor swimming pool. Natsume: Oh, that sounds like a nice place to go to on a date. Mei: Actually, we went to the one by the station... Suzune: Wait, there's a pool by the station? When did they build that? Natsume: It must have a hot spring built in too. If it's by the station, I should go check it out myself sometime. Mei: Umm... No, it's not that sort of pool. It's a gym... Natsume: What? A gym? Mei: Yes. Like, a fitness center... Kanna: You went to a fitness center together? Mei: Yes... That is indeed where we went. Suzune: Oh. I thought for sure you went to a recreational pool to mess around and have fun. Mei: We just went to do some exercise. Separately... Kanna: Separately? Natsume: That... doesn't sound like much of a date. Suzune: More like a workout, than anything. Kanna: That's rather disappointing... Mei: Wh-What do you mean? It wasn't supposed to be a date! Suzune: Oh, come on. Don't be shy. Mei: I'm telling you, it wasn't a date! Suzune: Psh. That's lame. Mei: H-How? Natsume: A gym, huh? Well, I can certainly see that, coming from you. Mei: ...... Kanna: What's the matter? Mei: No, it's just... I feel a little dumb about the whole thing... Natsume: What for? Mei: The truth is, Senpai thought we were going to a recreational pool as well, but the idea hadn't crossed my mind at all... Suzune: Ahh. So Kousei was the only one who thought it was a date. Mei: N-No, I don't think that's the case... Mei: But still, he was absolutely right. We shouldn't have gone to a fitness center pool... Natsume: Oh, okay. So you wish you'd picked a better place for a date as well. Mei: F-For the last time, it wasn't a date! Kanna: Then allow me to be frank. How do you feel about him? Mei: Who? Kanna: Takamine-san, of course. Mei: Huh? Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What do you mean by that? Natsume: That reaction already says it all. Mei: N-No, I just, um... I have a lot of respect for him. Natsume: Respect? Mei: Y-Yes. Natsume: You... respect him? Kanna: Please don't look so bewildered. I feel bad for him now. Natsume: Sorry. Suzune: You respect him, nothing more? Mei: Huh? Well, um... I guess it's not only that... Mei: But... it's mostly respect... I think... Suzune: Hmm. Suzune: ...... Suzune: Nozomi-san's coming in today, isn't she? Kanna: Yes. Her shift starts at lunch. Suzune: Good. Are you all busy tonight? Natsume: Not particularly. Kanna: I don't have any plans either. Suzune: Well, if Nozomi-san's free as well, let's have a girls' night out! Suzune: Against the four of us, Mei-san doesn't stand a chance. Mei: Wait! What are you going to do to me?! Kanna: That's a great idea. Natsume: Sounds like fun. Mei: What? Huh? Why? Suzune: ...... Mei: Wh-What? Why are you grinning at me like that? Seriously, what? Suzune: Alright! Time to get to work, everybody! Kanna: Let's get down to it! Natsume: I'm looking forward to tonight. Mei: Wait, what? Hold up. Mei: Seriously? Kousei: See you guys later. Natsume: See you. Suzune: Where do you girls want to go? Should we find a restaurant somewhere? Kousei: Oh, are you all going out to eat? Kanna: We're having a girls' night out tonight. Nozomi: I can't wait. *giggle* Mei: ...... Kousei: Is it just me, or is Hiuchidani-san the only one not very excited about it? Natsume: Don't be silly. She's totally excited. Right? Mei: Yes. I am very excited. Kousei: Huh. Could've fooled me. Suzune: Actually, why don't we just go to my place? We'll have a hard time finding any places open this late. Natsume: True. We can just stop by a convenience store on the way and buy something there. Suzune: Alright. Let's get going. Suzune: Oh, and no boys allowed, so go kill some time before you follow us home, Kousei. Kousei: Huh? But if we're all going to the same apartment complex, why can't I just-- Suzune: No can do. Our girls' night out is already underway. Kousei: Fine. Suzune: Come on, girls. Let's go. Nozomi: Okaay. Mei: ...... Kousei: You alright, Hiuchidani-san? Mei: ...... Kousei: I'm gonna take that as a \"no.\" Suzune: Come on, Mei-san. Mei: Okay... Kousei: ...... Kousei: Weird. Suzune: Anyone want a beer? Natsume: I'm fine. Kanna: No, thank you. Suzune: Oh, well. More for me. Nozomi: Uh, so I forgot to ask, but why exactly are we having a girls' night out anyway? Suzune: So we can interrogate Mei-san about her relationship with Kousei. Nozomi: Her relationship with Kousei-kun? Mei: I wanna go home. Suzune: Aww, c'mon. We won't ask you anything too invasive. Just play along with us for tonight. Mei: *sigh*... What do you want to know? Kanna: In all honesty, how do you feel about Takamine-san? Mei: Cutting right to the chase, huh. I already answered that this morning, didn't I? Kanna: You said you respected him, but is that really all there is to it? Mei: I mean... Nozomi: Did something happen between them? Natsume: They went out somewhere together yesterday. Nozomi: Oh, phew. That's not bad... Suzune: What do you mean? Nozomi: I was afraid they'd gotten into a fight or something. Suzune: Oh, no. Just the opposite. They've actually been getting quite chummy lately. Nozomi: Oh, really? Natsume: How do you feel about all this, Sumizome-san? You're his childhood friend. Nozomi: He's never really been popular with girls, so honestly... I think it's great! It feels like my little Kousei-kun is finally growing up! Kanna: It almost sounds like you're talking about him as a brother. Nozomi: Well, we have known each other for a long time. That's just what happens. Kanna: There's your answer. Mei: What? Seriously, what? How do you want me to respond to that? Suzune: Let me be serious with you for a moment. Mei: Um, okay. Suzune: Whenever you have men and women working in the same place, it often presents a unique problem. Mei: Okay? Suzune: See, it's fine if they get along well, but if things turn sour, that can affect the atmosphere of the entire workplace, reducing productivity. Suzune: In order to avoid such things, it's therefore important for me to have a clear understanding of my coworkers' interpersonal relationships. Mei: Oh. I think I get that... Mei: ...... Mei: Did you really need to invite everyone else here for that, though? Suzune: Nope. Mei: What? Suzune: I just thought it'd be funner with more people. Mei: Seriously? Suzune: I won't deny that I'm doing this for amusement, but I also want to support you. Suzune: All you guys feel that way too, right? Natsume: Well, half that, and half out of curiosity. Kanna: I came 100\\% out of curiosity. Nozomi: In that case, I came 100\\% to support you! Suzune: See? Mei: Oh, uh... Thanks? Natsume: To be honest, like Suzune-san said, I want to know how things are going between you two as well--even though it's not really any of my business. Natsume: The cafe is just a really important place to me, so I'd hate for there to be any problems caused by interpersonal relationships. Natsume: Maybe I'm just a cynic, but I feel like it's all too easy for office romances to lead to those sorts of conflicts. Mei: Romance? Umm... I had a feeling that's where this was going, but, like... Natsume: Am I wrong? Mei: I don't think things between me and him are... like that. Kanna: You don't sound very confident. Mei: I mean, I don't have any experience with relationships, so I don't really know... Suzune: It definitely seems like you've got chemistry, though. From what I've seen, at least. Mei: Chemistry? Kanna: I agree. You become much more animated when you're talking with Takamine-san compared to when you talk with us. Mei: I-Is that true? I've never realized that myself... Natsume: I'd go so far as to say your eyes start to sparkle... maybe? Well, you get the idea. Suzune: You always go \"Senpai, Senpai!\" in such a cheerful voice. Whenever you're with Kousei, you seem even more upbeat than usual. Mei: What? Seriously? Natsume: What do you think, Sumizome-san? Have you noticed any recent changes in Takamine-kun's behavior? Nozomi: Hmm... I don't know. They definitely get along well, that's for sure. Nozomi: Ah--but I guess he seems a lot more... relaxed whenever he's around Mei-chan. Compared to Natsume-san and Kanna-san, for example. Natsume: True. He won't even sit beside me in class. Nozomi: Not a surprise. He's not really used to dealing with girls. Nozomi: But when he's with Mei-chan, I feel like he's more comfortable acting natural. Natsume: Hmm. I guess part of it might have to do with her being younger. Suzune: Not all the time, though. Yesterday he was all restless and fidgety. Mei: What? He was? Suzune: Yep. He was having a bit of trouble concentrating on work. Suzune: It made me smile, but he also kind of needed to get his act together. Suzune: So in all seriousness, the sooner you two sort out your feelings, the happier I'll be. Mei: Urk... Easier said than done... Kanna: It's almost Valentine's Day too. The timing couldn't be better. Nozomi: Oh, Valentine's Day! Are we doing anything special at the cafe? Natsume: Hopefully. Suzune-san and I are still figuring out what, though. Suzune: We'll probably do another limited-time special like we did on Christmas. I doubt it'll be as hectic this time around, though. Nozomi: True. People don't usually buy their Valentine's chocolates from cake shops. Suzune: If only chocolate had a longer shelf life. But yeah, that's why it's just going to be a limited-time thing, for girls to buy for their acquaintances and such. Suzune: You know, friend-chocolate. Kanna: Oh, that's right! I nearly forgot to ask. What should we do about OUR chocolates? Natsume: You mean for Takamine-kun? Kanna: Yes. And Mikado-san too. I wasn't sure if we should give our male coworkers chocolates. Nozomi: Why don't we give them one big gift, from all of us? That way it'll be easier for them to prepare a return gift too, as opposed to having to buy a gift for each of us individually. Natsume: Good idea. He'd probably be disappointed if we didn't get him anything. Suzune: In that case, Mei-san can get him something a little more personal. Mei: Gosh, why do we keep going here? Suzune: Well, it's either that or you pitch in with the rest of us. Which do you want? Mei: Well... I mean... Urk... Suzune: See? You don't want to, do you? Mei: Well, I mean... he does a lot for me, so, like... Mei: If I'm going to give him something... I want it to be from ME. Natsume: That's the only reason? Mei: Urk... Kanna: Oh? You're not denying it. Mei: I don't know what you want me to say... Mei: Ngh! Mei: I really don't know. I mean, I do l-like him, of course... Mei: But I just like him as a person... I don't know if that means I l-love him or not. Suzune: Ahhh! So adorbs! My heart can't take it! Natsume: God, what's gotten into you? Are you drunk? Suzune: A little. Kanna: Let me ask you this then. If Takamine-san started getting chummy with another girl, how would that make you feel? Mei: Hmm... Natsume: Out of all of us, I'd say he's closest to Sumizome-san, right? Nozomi: I guess, considering how long we've known each other. Suzune: Do you ever feel like there's a side of him only you know about? Nozomi: Something only I know? Let me think... Nozomi: His face when he wakes up, I guess? Kanna: You're not talking about what I think you are, are you? Nozomi: No, not like that. He gets up early by himself now, but I used to have to come over every morning to wake him up. Suzune: Ahh. I have a younger brother too, so I know what that's like. He'd always whine and yell when I yanked off his covers. Nozomi: Yeah... I once made the mistake of doing that too... Natsume: Why was it a mistake? Nozomi: You know how in the morning, guys get... um, you know... Suzune: Morning wood? Nozomi: Oh my god! You just outright said it! Mei: Morning what? Suzune: It's when guys get an uncontrollable erection in the morning. Mei: ...... Mei: Ahh! Suzune: Gee, what an adorable reaction. Nozomi-san, on the other hand, seems like she's pretty used to it. Nozomi: I wouldn't really say that. I've just happened to see it a few times, is all... Suzune: Oh-ho. So you've seen his erect ding-a-ling \"a few times,\" have you now? Natsume: His what? Kanna: She's definitely drunk, alright. Nozomi: I-It wasn't on purpose or anything, okay? It just happened on rare occasions when I came to wake him up... Suzune: Well, how does it feel knowing another woman's seen his, um... his wing-dang-doodle, Mei-san? Natsume: Excuse me? Kanna: You're a terrible drunk, Suzune-san. Suzune: Go ahead and tell us. Another woman's seen his private parts. How does that make you feel? Mei: Urk... Mei: Ngh... Mei: Nghhh! Mei: ...... Mei: It makes me feel... a little put out... I guess. Suzune: So you do have some feelings for him, deep down. Mei: Urk... I don't know... Suzune: Well, if you're planning to make him some homemade chocolate, let me know. I'll teach you everything you need to know. Mei: Homemade? But that'd totally make it seem like I... you know. Natsume: Like you're confessing to him, right. Mei: He might think I'm being too clingy, though... Nozomi: I don't know about that. I think he'd be thrilled. Suzune: So what do you say? Wanna make some homemade chocolate? Mei: Homemade chocolate... to confess my feelings... Homemade chocolate... Mei: Urk... Nghhhh! Mei: Ngh. Nozomi: M-Mei-chan? Natsume: She collapsed. Kanna: Her face is red as a beet too. Mei: I can't think straight anymore... My head's about to explode... Suzune: Aww, look at her. Acting all flustered like a young girl in love. Natsume: I feel like it's mostly your fault she's like this. Suzune: Sorry, she's just too cute. I can't help but tease her. Mei: Please, just let me go home already... I'm really not good with these sorts of conversations... Kanna: I know I said I only came because I was curious, but if you really are planning to confess to Takamine-san, I'll be glad to assist in any way I can. Kanna: I'd love for you two to be happily together. Nozomi: Me too! Let me know if there's anything I can do. Natsume: Alright. I think it's time we put this conversation to rest. It doesn't look like Hiuchidani-san can take much more. Mei: I can't... I'm about to die from embarrassment... Suzune: Man, what I wouldn't give to be young again... Kanna: What are you talking about? You're still plenty young. Suzune: There's a world of difference between being a student and being a working adult. Suzune: Time'll pass by before you know it, Mei-san. Make sure you don't leave any regrets behind. Mei: Urk... Alright. I'll try to think about how I really feel... Suzune: Honestly, though, it's already pretty clear to the rest of us. Kanna: That's just how love works. The person themselves can oftentimes be oblivious to the fact. Natsume: Very true. Nozomi: You three talk like you know a lot. You must have a ton of dating experience, huh? All Three: ...... Nozomi: Why did you all look away? Do you... not? Natsume: Anyway, why don't we start discussing our Valentine's Day menu? Suzune: Sounds like a great idea! Kanna: Indeed! Nozomi: Oops... I guess I shouldn't have asked. Mei: Urk... Mei: Do I really like him... that way? Mei: ...... Mei: Urk... I don't know! Ngh! Mei: G-Good morning! Kousei: What did you do to her yesterday? Suzune: Nothing. We just had a little chat. Kousei: ...... Suzune: Why are you giving me that look? Kousei: Because she's clearly acting weird. Suzune: Well, it's obvious why... Suzune: ...... Kousei: What do you mean? Suzune: Well, maybe I do owe her an apology. Kousei: What? Suzune: I might've teased her a little too much. Kousei: Huh? Suzune: Well, thankfully, we might see some progress now. Kousei: What progress? Suzune: You'll see soon enough. And you'd better thank me when it happens. Kousei: When what happens? Suzune: Uh-oh. Our orders are starting to pile up. Better get back to work. Kanna: Actually, Takamine-san, could I ask you and Mei-san to stay behind for a little while? Mei: Huh? Suzune: Hold on. What are you doing? Kanna: This doesn't have anything to do with what we discussed yesterday. I just need to talk to them about their shifts. Suzune: Oh, okay. Suzune: Well, see you all tomorrow! Natsume: Bye, everyone. Kanna: No, of course not. Kousei: I thought so. This is about Hiuchidani-san's eye, isn't it? Mikado: Yes, indeed. Mei: I forgot to ask before, but does anyone at the cafe else know about my eye? Mikado: Natsume knows. Suzune and Nozomi do not, however. Mei: Natsume-san san knows too? That's a relief. Kanna: Still, I must advise you not to speak with her about it too carelessly. We wouldn't want anyone overhearing you by accident. Mei: Alright. Mikado: How are things going with your eye? Mei: Nothing much has changed. Mikado: Which means you haven't found a way to release your butterflies yet? Mei: Err... No, not yet. Kanna: We haven't had many opportunities to practice, after all. Would you like to do some now? Mei: Sure. Mei: But that being said... Mikado: You said you are able to capture butterflies simply by staring at them, correct? Mei: Yeah. After I stare at them for a while, they just disappear. Kanna: In that case, perhaps you could do the opposite, and try staring at an empty space while imagining them appearing. Mei: Imagine them appearing? Mei: Nghhh... Mei: ...... Mei: It's not working. Kousei: What about other people who had the eye? How did they release their butterflies? Mikado: Well, if we knew that, we would not be having this problem. Kousei: Good point. But haven't any other Grim Reapers documented it? Kanna: We've tried searching for more information, but no such luck. Kanna: And to the best of my knowledge, Mei-san is the only person who possesses the eye yet can't see the butterflies. Kousei: So she's an anomaly? Mikado: We don't know that either. People who possess the eye are rare enough in and of themselves. There is simply not enough information. Mikado: That is precisely what makes her such an interesting case study. Kousei: You make her sound like some kind of guinea pig... Mei: That's okay. I want to find out everything I can about my eye as well. Mei: If anything, I should be the one apologizing for being so unhelpful... Kanna: If only I could use my scythe to retrieve the butterflies from your eye... Kousei: You can't? Kanna: I don't dare try. It could end up causing unforeseen damage to Mei-san's soul. Kanna: Perhaps if I knew exactly where the butterflies were located, I might be able to do something about it, but I don't. Mikado: We are no longer able to sense butterflies that have been captured by the eye. Mikado: That is why we did not realize that Mei possessed the eye in the first place. Kousei: Interesting. Kanna: I just had an idea, Mei-san. Mei: Yes? Kanna: Whenever you capture butterflies, is there anything in particular that you think of? Mei: Something I think of? Hmm... I'm not really sure... Kanna: So you do it without thinking? Mei: Well... I guess I think to myself, \"Go away!\" or something like that. Mei: But the very first time I ever noticed a wisp... Mei: ...... Mei: I was mostly just curious. \"What is that?\" I thought, and so I kept staring at it until it disappeared. Mei: That's what crossed my mind the first time it happened, at least. Kanna: Just curiosity... Kousei: So then if she does the opposite, and tries NOT to think about the butterflies, she'll be able to release them? Mikado: You realize that, until just recently, she had no idea that there were even butterflies inside her? Kousei: Oh, right. I guess she hasn't been thinking about them this whole time. I wonder what it is she needs then? Kanna: Maybe what she needs is... something more concrete. Mei: What do you mean? Kanna: If, by thinking about \"butterflies\", you are able to capture them... Kanna: Then perhaps by focusing your thoughts on a specific \"place\", you'll be able to release them. Mei: Oh. So instead of just vaguely trying to release them anywhere, I should try to think about releasing them towards someplace specific? Kanna: Why don't you give it a shot? Mei: Alrighty! Mei: Ngh... Mei: Nghh! Mei: C'mon, the chair... The chair! Mei: Nggghhhhh! Mikado: It doesn't seem to be working. Mei: I'm sorry... Kanna: Maybe you aren't focusing hard enough... or maybe I'm just completely wrong. Kanna: Hmm... Kanna: Your Excellency. Mikado: Yes? Kanna: Please turn into your cat form. Mikado: I beg your pardon? Kanna: Please turn into your cat form. Mikado: I refuse. Kanna: Please turn into your cat form. Mikado: You can repeat yourself however many times you wish, but no means no! Kanna: Please! I'm sure this will work! Remember that Mei-san has an abnormal fixation with cats. Mikado: I will not! Mei: A-Abnormal fixation? That's mean... Kousei: Well... she's not wrong. Mei: You too, Senpai?! Kousei: I mean... you turn pretty crazy whenever you see a cat. Kanna: To put it bluntly, you turn into a complete maniac. Mei: W-Wow! You're so mean! Kanna: We've got nothing to lose by trying. Please, Your Excellency! This is for Mei-san's sake! Mikado: Kgh... Very well. But you had best keep yourself under control this time, Mei. Mei: Don't worry! I will, I promise! Mikado: I do not believe you! Kanna: Please, Your Excellency. Hurry it up! Mikado: Fine... Have your wish! Mei: Ahhhhhhh! Mikado: Mei! Have you already forgotten your promise?! Mei: R-R-Relax! I-I'm fine! I-I'm completely calm! Kousei: That look in your eyes begs to differ... Kanna: This is just a guess... but Mei-san seems like the kind of person stray cats run from. Mei: How did you know? It's true; even cats that are used to people always run away from me! I wonder why? Mikado: Is it not painfully obvious? Kanna: Now then, Mei-san. Please try imagining your butterflies being released around His Excellency. Mei: R-Right! A-Around His Excellency! Y-Yes! O-Of course! Mikado: I do not wish to be rude, Mei, but I find your behavior most repulsive right now. Kousei: That's about as rude as it gets, though. Mei: I don't mind! He can call me repulsive as much as he wants! Kousei: You've got problems, Hiuchidani-san. Seriously. Mei: A-Anyway, here I go! Mikado: Very well. But you can do it standing from there. Do not come any closer, you hear? Mei: A-Alright! *pant*... *pant*... Mikado: ...... Mei: *pant*... *pant*! Mikado: Why are you breathing so heavily? Mei: *PANT*... *PANT*! Mikado: Enough! If this goes on any further, I will not be safe! Mei: *PAAAANT*! Kanna: Alright, Mei-san. Settle down, settle down. Mei: Huh? It's over? My time's up already? Wait! How much do I have to pay for an extension?! Mikado: What on earth is this child talking about? Kousei: Well, I guess that didn't work either. Kanna: My idea must've been wrong. I suppose we'll have to think this over some more. Mei: Five thousand yen! I'll pay five thousand yen! Mikado: That is quite enough. Playtime is over. Mei: Ahh... He's gone... Mikado: Good grief. I am beginning to suspect that this derangement of yours is a side effect of using your eye... Mei: What do you mean? I was totally calm and collected. Kousei: ...... Kanna: ...... Mikado: I believe you have something to say to me, Mei. Mei: Okay, fine! I'm sorry! Kanna: Anyway, why don't we stop here for today? Mikado: Before we do, though, I must ask. Have you captured any other butterflies lately besides the ones in the cafe? Mei: No. I haven't used my powers at all outside of the cafe. Mikado: Alright. Very well. Kanna: If that's all, then we'll see you-- Mei: Actually, can I ask one more thing? Mikado: Yes? Mei: Is it possible that using my eye... could have a negative effect on the person? Kanna: You mean when you use it to capture butterflies? Mei: Yeah. You said that it had the power to heal people's souls, but, um... how do I put this... Kousei: For example, if a person's soul was weakened because of a physical problem, healing their soul wouldn't resolve the underlying issue. Kousei: On the contrary, healing only their soul might have a negative effect on their body. Kousei: I think that's what Hiuchidani-san means to say. Mei: R-Right. That's it. Thank you. Mikado: Hmm... It is difficult to say for certain. Mei: In that case, isn't it kind of risky for me to be using my eye on our customers? Mikado: Perhaps. But it is also better than doing nothing. Mikado: There have been no instances of any customers returning to the cafe with new butterflies after you captured their old ones. Mikado: As of this moment, we have no reason to believe that the power of your eye has any negative effect on others. Mei: Oh... Kanna: Did something happen that caused you to think that it might? Mei: N-No, not exactly... Mei: ...... Mei: It's just... I feel like I've been getting a little carried away ever since I learned the truth about my eye, and learned that there were other people that understood me. Mei: If it turns out that my eye is causing others harm, though... I'd rather just stop using it altogether. Mikado: It is I who tasked you with capturing other people's butterflies. If there truly are any negative consequences of doing so, it would be my responsibility to bear. Mikado: So do not worry. Thanks to you, our job of collecting butterflies has been going remarkably smoothly. That is a fact. Mei: Okay. Thank you for saying that. Kanna: Are there any other questions you'd like to ask? Mei: No, that's all. Kanna: In that case, I'll see you both tomorrow. Good night. Mikado: Good night. Make sure you get plenty of rest. Mei: We will. Good night! Kousei: Good night. Kanna: ...... Mikado: Are you still worried? Kanna: I'm a little relieved, actually, knowing that Mei-san has her own reservations about using her eye. Mikado: I've never been worried about that myself. Despite appearances, she is a very rational-- Mikado: ...... Kanna: Struggling to finish that sentence, aren't you? Mikado: Allow me to rephrase. Although she tends to lose her head under certain circumstances, she is generally a very compassionate person. Mikado: She is the sort of person who would never even think about abusing the power of her eye. Kanna: I'm not worried about that either. I trust Mei-san completely. Kanna: What worries me is... something else. Mikado: We've already warned her many times not to let anyone realize the truth about her eye. Kanna: I know. Of course, times have changed now, but still... Mikado: People's hearts remain largely the same. Kanna: That's why I was against using her eye in the first place. Kanna: There may not be any problems right now, but if things start to fall apart, Mei-san will be the one to suffer. Kanna: And all the positive influence she's been having on Takamine-san's soul will be for naught. Kanna: If anything were to happen to Mei-san, Takamine-san would undoubtedly be greatly affected as well. Mikado: Hmm. So it is not Mei, but Takamine Kousei you are worried about? Kanna: I'm worried about them both. But... I realize I may just be feeling overprotective. Kanna: If you wish for her to have full control over the power of her eye, I won't object. Rest assured. Mikado: I understand that you are concerned, but we cannot allow these butterflies to simply remain inside of Mei either. Kanna: I know. Mikado: Incidentally, Kanna. Kanna: Yes? Mikado: What exactly was it that you and Mei spoke about yesterday? I understand you and the others had a \"girls' night out.\" Kanna: Tsk, tsk. How rude, Your Excellency. You mustn't ask a young lady to divulge her secrets. Mikado: Ah. So it was nothing of importance then. Kanna: Nihihi. Nope. Just a little gossip between girls, is all. Kanna: I do hope everything works out between those two, though... Mei: Oh... yeah. It's been weighing on my mind for a while now. Mei: The truth is, I've been getting a little carried away ever since His Excellency gave me this task. Mei: I'm worried that I've only been adding to people's troubles, like I did to her. Mei: I was starting to question whether capturing our customer's wisps was the right thing to do. Kousei: Hmm... It's hard to say. Mei: Yeah. It is. Kousei: But you know, I've been thinking as well. Kousei: I suggested that maybe this friend of yours had a physical problem, and that's why she still hasn't gotten better. Kousei: But after you'd cast your \"magic spell\" on her, you saw a significant improvement in her mood, didn't you? Mei: Yeah. While I wouldn't say she recovered completely, there was definitely a big improvement. Kousei: If that's true, then it must be some sort of emotional problem. That's why the power of your eye was able to cheer her up temporarily. Kousei: And in that case, there's no doubt in my mind that your \"magic spell\" provided her with some much-needed relief. Kousei: While it's unfortunate that she ended up becoming overly dependent on it, it's clear that the weight in your friend's heart was lightened because of you. Kousei: If I had to say whether it was the right or wrong decision, I'd have to say it was right. Kousei: So I don't think there's anything you should feel guilty or anxious about. Kousei: The power in your left eye is unmistakably a power that helps others. And I'm certain it'll help a lot more people from now on. Mei: ...... Kousei: Uh... sorry. Maybe it's not my place to say anything. Mei: N-No, don't apologize... Mei: ...... Mei: C-Can you read my mind, Senpai? Kousei: Huh? Mei: It makes me really happy... You always seem to know exactly what I want to hear. Mei: It almost feels like you know exactly what I'm thinking all the time. Kousei: Nah... I'm not that sensitive, to be honest. In fact, I can be downright insensitive sometimes. Kousei: But one thing I will say is that I'm not saying these things just to cheer you up. Kousei: I mean it. All of it. Kousei: The stuff about me being grateful to you, and the stuff about your eye--you, helping other people. Kousei: I mean all of it, from the bottom of my heart. Kousei: And if I managed to get that message across to you, well... then that'd make me happy too. Mei: ...... Kousei: Sorry if I seem like I'm trying too hard to be cool or something. I'm lame, I know. Mei: N-No! You're really not... Mei: ...... Mei: U-Umm! Kousei: Hm? Mei: Do you like sweets, Senpai? Kousei: Huh? What's this about? Mei: Do you? Kousei: Well, sure, I guess. Mei: Okay, great! Good night! Kousei: Huh? O-Oh. Yeah, g'night. Mei: Thanks for walking me home! See you tomorrow! Kousei: R-Right. See you tomorrow... Mei: ...... Mei: Hi, Suzune-san? It's me, Mei. I'm sorry for the random call... Mei: Um, I was wondering something... Mei: ...... Mei: C-Could you teach me how to make my own chocolate? , Somei: I'll try to be more positive. I feel like people tend to worry too much about contacting old friends, only to find out it's no big deal once they actually do it. Kousei: True. Somei: Don't you have to get back to work, though? Kousei: Oh, crap! I forgot! Somei: Speaking of the cafe, I wouldn't say no to a slice of cake next time you visit! Kousei: Well, I guess. But I thought you were about to be discharged soon? Somei: Yeah, I am. Kousei: In that case, you might as well come by the cafe yourself. Somei: Ahh, sure. I'll think about it. Kousei: By the way, do you think I could get your phone number? Somei: Oh-ho! And you said you're not a cheater. She's not gonna be happy to hear this! Kousei: Please don't joke about that. She can be seriously scary when she gets mad. Somei: Why do you want my number then? Oh, are you gonna introduce me to one of your guy friends? Kousei: Hmm. Well, if you're serious, I guess I could introduce you to one of my college buddies. Somei: Wait. Seriously? Kousei: Sure, it's not that big of a deal. Kousei: I won't ask you to do anything for me in return... but maybe you'd be willing to give me some advice? Natsume: How does kissing feel so good? All we're doing is putting our lips together... Natsume: If this is what kissing feels like, then... Female Nurse: Oh? Has your boyfriend already left? Natsume: He came here during his break at work, so he couldn't stay long. Female Nurse: You're a lucky girl. Not many guys would come see their girlfriend every day of the week. Natsume: ...... Female Nurse: Oh, no need to blush. Female Nurse: There's no reason a pretty girl like you shouldn't have a man or two around her arm. You might not think it, but I was quite the playgirl back in my younger days. Natsume: I'm fine with just the one, actually. Female Nurse: Oh, you're more pure-hearted than I expected. Natsume: Anyway, um... there's something I'd like to ask. Female Nurse: What's that? Natsume: If I leave the hospital tomorrow as scheduled, will I be able to go back to my life as usual? Female Nurse: Well, yes. Natsume: So I should be able to take hot baths, and engage in a bit of... ph-physical activity? Female Nurse: That shouldn't be a problem. But it'll also depend on what kind of physical activity you... Female Nurse: Ahh. So THAT'S what you mean. Female Nurse: Most girls your age are interested in those things, all the more so if they have a boyfriend. Heck, back in my younger days, I-- Natsume: Ngh! Female Nurse: Well, maybe another time. But I get it--you can't exactly ask Dr. Miyama a question like that. Alright. I'll try to ask him for you as discreetly as I can. Natsume: I'd, um, appreciate that... Female Nurse: Oh, how I wish I was young like you again. Kousei: ...... Suzune: Try relaxing a bit more, will you? Kousei: Easier said than done. I can't help but worry. Kanna: Did the tests come back okay? Kousei: Yeah, that's what she texted me. Said she was clear to be discharged today. Suzune: Alright. The caprese-style pasta's ready to go out. Kanna: I'll take it. Kanna: Here is your caprese-style pasta. I'll bring you your sachertorte and blend coffee once you've finished. Kanna: Please, enjoy your meal. Mikado: Welcome to Cafe Stella. Hm? Ah, if it isn't Shiki Natsume. Natsume: Hello. Mei: Huh? Oh, it's Natsume-senpai! Welcome back! Nozomi: Welcome back! Natsume: Oh, I didn't know you two were working today. Nozomi: They needed some extra help till you got back. Mei: Plus, we wanted to be here to see you! Boy, I ran here as fast as I could once school let out. Natsume: Ah. Thanks for doing that. Mei: Oh, you don't have to thank us for that! Ahaha. Mei: We've missed you a whole lot this past week. Nozomi: Since they let you out, does that mean you're all good to go now? Natsume: Yeah. I'm fine. Nozomi: Are you sure? You weren't in the hospital for as long as I thought you'd be. Kanna: Health and sickness start with the mind, after all. I'm sure those daily visits from a certain somebody did wonders to speed her recovery. Nozomi & Mei: Ahh. Natsume: You didn't have to say that out loud. Kanna: Welcome back, Natsume-san. Mikado: Welcome back. Natsume: Thanks. I'll be able to get back to work by tomorrow. Mei: What? So soon? You can rest up a little longer, if you need to. Nozomi: Yeah. If you need any help settling back into things, just ask! We're all here for you! Natsume: I will. Thank you, everyone. Kanna: But that's enough about work. You're here as a customer today, aren't you? Mei: Table for one, Miss? Suzune: Ah, look who it is. I had a feeling that's what all the commotion was about. Suzune: Welcome back, Natsume-san. Natsume: Mhm. I'm glad to be back. Kousei: Make it non-alcoholic, please. Bartender: Certainly. Kousei: You okay after all that? I'm surprised you don't have heartburn. Natsume: A small price to pay. Humans can't live without eating good food. Kousei: You seem like you're in a good mood. Natsume: Maybe it's because I just got out of the hospital, but everything tasted so delicious. Kousei: Because... of me? Natsume: Nope. Not quite. Natsume: Not just because of you, but because of everyone. Kousei: You mean everyone at the cafe? Natsume: Yeah. I don't want to sound like I'm still hung up on this, though. Kousei: Don't worry. I'm here to listen. Natsume: See, years ago, whenever I was released from the hospital... people would always stare at me from a distance. Natsume: They didn't exactly treat me like I was helpless, but they always seemed confused, like they didn't know what to say to me. Natsume: And that's why... Bartender: Here you are, ma'am. Kousei: Stop joking about that. Kousei: If it turns out there's actually alcohol in there, I'm going to start worrying about you again. Natsume: Okay, okay. Sorry. I'll stop for today. Kousei: Alright. Let's get you home now. Natsume: ...... Kousei: Natsume? Natsume: Nothing... Kousei: Okay? Kousei: Oh, yeah. Finals are coming up. You feeling confident? You've been pretty busy lately, so you probably haven't had much time to study. Natsume: Well, I'm sure I'll manage. Kousei: Why don't we study together sometime for the class we share? Natsume: Sure. I don't mind. Kousei: ...... Natsume: ...... Kousei: ...... Kousei: What's the matter? Kousei: ...... Kousei: Haha, very funny. I thought I told you to stop joking ar-- Natsume: I'm not joking. And I'm not drunk either. Kousei: ...... Natsume: I want to stay with you... a bit longer... Kousei: Ah, er, sorry. Yeah... Kousei: I just never expected this, so my mind's kinda going haywire right now. So, um... Kousei: Alright. Kousei: I want to be with you too, Natsume. Kousei: *pant*... *pant*... Kousei: ...... Kousei: Nghhh! Kousei: *inhale*... *exhale*... *inhale*... *exhale*... *inhale*... Kousei: %123;*choke*?! Kousei: Er, no. 'Course not. Kousei: *inhale*... *exhale*... Kousei: You look really sexy. Natsume: Ngh... Kousei: Err, sorry. That was supposed to be a compliment. Y-You're not mad, are you? Natsume: No, I'm not. It's just... incredibly embarrassing. Kousei: You really look beautiful, though. Positively stunning. I'm getting turned on just looking at you. Kousei: My bad. Kousei: But, err, instead of that... Kousei: Can I... touch you? Natsume: Are you really going to ask me that now? Take a hint. Kousei: Yeah. Sorry. Natsume: It's my first time, so we need to do a bit more foreplay first. You know, kissing, stuff like that... Kousei: R-Right. Sorry. Kissing... Nhh... Natsume: I wasn't saying for you to kiss me down THERE! Kousei: Huh? Natsume: Why are you surprised?! Is this really news to you?! There's an order to this stuff! Kousei: O-Oh. Sorry. You're right. First things first. Kousei: Please tell me your name and age. Natsume: What am I, interviewing for the casting couch? Natsume: Oh, for crying out loud. You totally ruined the mood now. Natsume: I hope you know how humiliating this is for me. Kousei: I'm sorry. I mean it. I apologize. Kousei: But you gotta understand; this is my first time too! I'm freaking out here! Natsume: Then make it up to me. Nhh... Natsume: Nhhh... Nh, mh... Nhh... Ah... That's the first time. Kousei: Huh? Natsume: The first time you've ever initiated a kiss. Kousei: Yeah, I guess so. Kousei: I'd better pay you back for all the times you've kissed me then... Nhh... Natsume: Ahmph... Hngh... *smack* *kiss*... Nhh... Nh... *kiss* *smooch*... Mhh... Kousei: No, they're perfect. And... super soft. Natsume: Ahh, nhh... Hngh... Nhhh... Kousei: Besides, it doesn't matter whether they're big or small. I don't care about size. Natsume: Is that supposed to be a compliment? Kousei: I dunno, to be honest. I think your boobs might be hypnotizing me. Kousei: They're so soft... and your nipples are such a beautiful pink too... It's really turning me on. Natsume: Well, um, I'm glad to hear it. Kousei: ...... Natsume: Stop staring at me in silence, will you? It's embarrassing. Kousei: Sorry, I didn't mean to. Kousei: *lick* *suck*... Your nipples are delicious, Natsume... Natsume: *pant* *pant*... It didn't hurt... Nhh... *pant*... Natsume: I just didn't expect it to feel this electrifying... *pant*... *pant*... Natsume: What's going to happen to me... if we go even further? Kousei: I don't know either. Kousei: But... I'm past the point of return. Kousei: It's... so pretty... Kousei: Well, I need to get a good look. Kousei: Don't wanna put it in the wrong hole, y'know... Natsume: Yeah, but... It doesn't look weird, does it? Kousei: It's beautiful. Seriously. That's the only word that comes to mind. Kousei: Is that not convincing enough for you? Natsume: No, I never said that... *pant* *pant*... *pant*... Urk... You're just staring so hard... Kousei: ...... Natsume: And now you go all quiet on me again. Kousei: Ah, err, sorry. I'm not doing it on purpose. I just can't tear my eyes away... Natsume: *pant*... *pant*... *pant*... *pant*... Kousei: Your vagina's so amazing. Natsume: Huh? What do you mean? Does it look weird? Kousei: No, of course not. Kousei: It's just, this is my first time doing any of this... All I can say is, it's amazing. Natsume: R-Really? Umm, how else would you describe it? Kousei: Let's see... Natsume: Delicious? What are you... N-No, wait. You're... Don't tell me you're... Ahh! Kousei: Nhh... *smooch* Natsume: Ngghhh?! Kousei: Your pussy? Natsume: Ngh! Don't say it outright! Natsume: You didn't hate putting your mouth on my p-pu... did you? You don't have to force yourself. Kousei: I don't hate it one bit. I love every part of you, Natsume. If anything, I want to lick it even more. Kousei: What about you, though? Do you not want me to lick it? Natsume: It's just... embarrassing. That's the worst part... but I don't mind it. Kousei: Alright. In that case... Natsume: Ahh?! Nghh... Mhh... Urk... Ahh! Kousei: *lick* *lick*... *slurp* Natsume: S-Sto... Not there... Ahh! It's too embarrassing... being licked there... Nhh! Natsume: Ah, *pant* *pant*... Do people usually have to go this far? Kousei: *lick... Not that I'd know... but I'm pretty sure this is a normal part of foreplay. Natsume: I'm just a little worried that you're getting most of your information from porn. Kousei: Well, judging from your reactions, it seems like you like this. Natsume: I mean... Kousei: Can I keep kissing you down here? I want to taste you even more, Natsume. Natsume: You promise you'll stop? Kousei: Sure... If I can pump the brakes in time. Kousei: But sorry in advance if I can't stop myself. I'm already on the verge of losing control as is. Kousei: *lick*... *lick* *slurp*... *kiss* *kiss*... *suck*... Natsume: Ahhh... Ahh, ah, ah... ahhh... Eeek?! Natsume: Ahhh?! Ahh... ah, ah, ah, ahhh! Kousei: I just tried focusing my kisses on a specific spot... *kiss* *suck* *kiss* *lick*... Natsume: Ahhh! W-Wait, not there... Noooo! My body's... tingling so much... Ahhh! Kousei: Nhh... Does it hurt? Natsume: It doesn't hurt, but I'm scared of how much my body's tingling. Kousei: Does that mean you want me to stop? Natsume: No, but... *pant* *pant*... A-Are you going to keep kissing me? Kousei: I thought you said you were scared? Natsume: I... I am... but you want to keep going, don't you? Kousei: Of course. But if you don't want me to, I won't; I'll stop here. Kousei: So tell me what you want, Natsume. Natsume: Urk... I-I know you already know what I'm going to say... Natsume: You're teasing me on purpose, aren't you? Kousei: That's not--completely untrue, I guess. Natsume: Nrgh... Kousei: But I don't want to do anything you don't like. That's the truth. Kousei: That's why I want you to say it clearly. Because once we go any further, I get the feeling I won't be able to stop myself. Natsume: Fine... Fine. Keep going. Natsume: I don't hate how much it tingles. It's a little scary, but I want you to keep going. Keep kissing me down there... Kousei: It's your own fault for being so wet down here. *lick* *lick* *kiss*... Natsume: Maybe, but you're definitely making those sounds on purpose... Ahhhh! Ah, ah, ah... ahh! Kousei: Wow... You just keep getting wetter and wetter... *lick* *smack*... Natsume: Ahhhh! I-I can't help it... You're kissing it in such a lewd way... Mhhhh! Kousei: I can be even lewder, you know. Natsume: Ah, ahh! Nooo... That's so dirty--ahh! Ahhh! Kousei: *suck* *slurp*... *lick* *lick*... *kiss*... Kousei: *kiss* *pant*... *pant*... *lick* *lick*... *kiss* *suck* Natsume: It feels, too good... I-I can't... *pant*... Hnghh! Natsume: What? *pant*... *pant*... S-Sorry... But if you keep kissing me like that, I... Hngghhh! Natsume: I can't, I can't, I can't... It feels too good! Ahhh, ahhh, eek! Kousei: Well, as long as I'm making you feel good, I'm happy... *suck* *lick*... Natsume: K-Keep... Keep licking my p-pu... that spot... Kiss it more. Kousei: *kiss*... *slurp* *suck*... Natsume: Ahhhhhh! Ah, ah, ahhh! Yes! That feels amazing... Ahhhhh! Kousei: Your reactions make me really happy, Natsume... *kiss* *lick* *lick*... *suck*... Natsume: Ah, ah! Nooo... No more... Ngh! I can't take this... Ahh! Natsume: S-Something's coming! Please, stop! Any more and I'll... Ah, ah, ahh! Kousei: Nhh... *suck* *slurp* *lick*... Natsume: Ahhh! I can't... I can't, I can't... ahh... I'm really gonna--! Natsume: Ah, ah, ahhhhhhhhhhhn! Kousei: You came, didn't you? Natsume: *pant*... *pant*... This is my first time... but I feel so happy... *pant* *pant* *pant* *pant*... Natsume: Wow... My head's gone all mushy... *pant* *pant*... Kousei: Should we take a little break? Natsume: Ngh... No... If we wait, I'll start getting scared again... Natsume: So let's keep going... Let's... have s-sex. Kousei: I haven't even put it in, though... Kousei: Wait--huh?! Don't tell me I just lost my virginity without even knowing it?! Natsume: Oh, hush, you idiot. That's not the only part of sex that feels good. Natsume: Just feeling each other's warmth like this... feels incredible... Kousei: Y-Yeah. Right, of course! Natsume: You're not listening to a word I'm saying, are you? Kousei: What do you want me to do? I'm just too excited about finally losing my virginity. Natsume: I mean, I get that, but still. Kousei: And I get to do it with the girl I love too. I couldn't be happier. Kousei: It's the only thing on my mind right now. Kousei: But you're sure about this, right? You want to go all the way with me? Natsume: Yeah. I want to go all the way. So hold me. Hold me tighter. Kousei: Sure thing. Natsume: It's a lot b-bigger than I thought... Kousei: I think I'm pretty average-sized, actually. Natsume: What?! R-Really? Kousei: Anyway... are you ready, Natsume? It's getting harder and harder to hold myself back. Natsume: I'm ready, but I want you to k-kiss me first. Kousei: I-In THIS position?! Natsume: No, you idiot. I don't mean down there... I mean a normal kiss. Nhh... Natsume: Ahh! *pant* *pant*... *pant*... M-My belly... feels so hot... Kousei: Ngh... Holy shit... Natsume: *pant* *pant*... I-It doesn't feel weird for you... does it? Kousei: Not at all. It feels amazing. Kousei: Your pussy is so warm, and the way it's sucking on me... it's squeezing me so tight. Kousei: And yet it's pulling me deeper still... I've never felt anything like this before. Seriously, it's amazing... Natsume: Me too... I've never... felt something so hot, so d-deep inside me before... Hngh... Kousei: Does it hurt? Natsume: A little bit, sure, but don't worry about me. And I doubt you're capable of stopping right now, right? Kousei: Yeah. Natsume: So I want you to kiss me instead. Make me forget about the pain. Keep me distracted. Kousei: Nhh... *kiss* Natsume: Urk... Nhh *kiss* *kiss*... *smooch*... *smack* *slurp*... Natsume: *pant* *pant*... *pant*... It doesn't hurt, so much as it feels strange... Natsume: Having this thing moving around inside of me is... *pant* *pant*... kind of amazing. Is it all the way inside? Kousei: Yeah. I think I'm all the way in. Kousei: I'm gonna start moving.

Kousei: It makes me happy to know I'm making you feel good, Natsume. Natsume: It feels like I'm being split apart... like my insides are tingling... *pant*... It feels like it hurts, but it feels so good... Natsume: I-I'm... I'm not the only one feeling good, am I? Does it feel good for you? Kousei: Do you really need to ask? Your pussy feels incredible. It's making me go crazy. Natsume: Ahh?! Ah, hngh! N-Not so rough! Ah, ah, ah, ahh! Natsume: It's making... such a dirty sound! Nghhhh! Kousei: I think it's really hot, actually... You don't mind if I keep going, do you? *smooch* Natsume: Nghh... Mhh... *kiss* *kiss* *smack*... *lick* *smooch*... *kiss*... Kousei: I can't stop myself anymore, Natsume! Natsume: I can feel you...

I love you, I love you! Natsume: It feels, so good... I want to stay like this forever... *kiss* *kiss*... *smack* *slurp*... Kousei: Natsume... If you keep kissing me like that... *smack* *kiss* *slurp*... Natsume: But it's distracting me from the pain... *kiss* *kiss* *smack*... *lick* *lick*... Kousei: Nhh! *kiss* *smooch*... *smack* Kousei: Does it hurt? Natsume: N-No... Something's... something's c-coming! It's coming... Ngghh! Natsume: It's my first time, but... Ahhhh! But I can't hold it back--ah! Ah, ah, ah, ah! Kousei: It makes me happier than anything to know that you're feeling good. In fact, it's turning me on even more. Natsume: Urk! At this rate, I'm gonna--mngh! *kiss* *smooch* *smooch* *smack*... *kiss* *kiss* Kousei: *kiss* Nh, mhh, nhh... Natsume: Ahh, I can't, I'm gonna... Ah, ah, ah! Hug me more! Tighter!

Kousei: Natsume... *kiss* Natsume: Mhhh, *smooch* *smack*... It's no use... Even if you kiss me, I... *smooch* *kiss* *kiss* *slurp*... Kousei: Hang in there. I'm about to cum too. Natsume: Ahhh! Ahh! Ahh! I'm gonna cum again! Kousei: Me too. This time, I'm gonna show you how I cum. Natsume: Show me... show me! I want to see you cum! Natsume: *pant* *pant*... Me too... I'm cumming again! Kiss me... kiss me! Kousei: *smooch* *kiss* *kiss* *smack*... *kiss* *smack*... Natsume: Nhhh! Ahh... *pant* *pant*... Ahmph, *kiss* *smooch* *slurp*! Kousei: Nhh, ahh... I'm cumming... Take it all! Natsume: I'll take it, I'll take it... So do it, inside--*kiss* *smack* *smack* *smooch*... Nhh, nghh! Kousei: Kh... ahh! I'm cumming, Natsume! Natsume: *smooch* *smooch* Nh, nhh, nhh, ngghhhh!

Nhhh, nh, ngghhhh! Natsume: Nggghhhhhhh! Kousei: Ngh, ahh... Natsume: *pant* *pant*... *pant*... I can hardly move... Kousei: Me too. Feels like I ejaculated every last bit of energy I had just now. Kousei: Just goes to show how turned on I was. And how much I love you. Natsume: Hey... I want another kiss... Kousei: Nhh... *kiss* *kiss*... *smooch*... Natsume: Mhh *smack*...

Maybe up the order limit to twenty-five. Kanna: Sounds good. Anyway, I'm sure you can guess why I've asked you two to stay behind. Mei: This is about my eye again, isn't it? Kanna: We just want to know how things are progressing, so this shouldn't take too much of your time. Has anything changed with your eye since we last spoke? Mei: No. I still don't know how to release my butterflies... Kanna: Not to worry. I'm certain you'll get there eventually. Mikado: Our main purpose in opening this cafe has always been to collect butterflies. Thanks to you, that task has been proceeding expeditiously. Mikado: Allow me to thank you for your hard work once again. We owe you our gratitude. Mei: A-All I'm doing is catching butterflies. I'd wouldn't exactly call that \"hard work\"... Mei: B-But either way, I'll continue to do my best to help! Mikado: Thank you. We appreciate it. Mei: ...... Mikado: But while I appreciate your efforts, I will not be transforming into a cat. Mei: Okay. I'm sorry. Kanna: Allow me to thank you as well, Takamine-san. Kousei: Huh? Why me? Kanna: While it was mere coincidence that brought you here to work with us, you've become an invaluable member of our team. Kanna: Many of our customers even come to our cafe specifically to eat your dishes now. Kanna: So thank you very much. You've been an incredible help to us all. Kousei: Well, I mean... this was all because of that \"problem\" I had with my soul in the first place... Kousei: But I'm glad you appreciate me. Honestly, this job has been pretty fulfilling for me too lately. Mikado: Indeed. It would appear your soul's condition has been greatly improving. Kanna: You can't let your guard down just yet, but as long as you keep heading in the right direction, you won't have anything to worry about. Kousei: Phew. That's a relief to hear. I owe it all to Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Huh? Kousei: Thanks for guiding me in the right direction. Mei: N-No, I didn't do anything. Kousei: You did. Thank you for everything. Mei: I-I... Mei: ...... Mei: U-Um, was there anything else you wanted to discuss? Kanna: No, I believe that's it. Mei: In that case, I've got something I need to do, so--! Mikado: Alright. Then we apologize for keeping you. Mei: That's okay! Anyway, I'll be going now! Kousei: Let me walk you-- Mei: Good night! Kousei: Huh? Kousei: Y-Yeah, I am... Kanna: Good night. Kousei: Yeah. Good night... Kousei: ...... Kousei: I should've known... Mei: Y-You're fine. Kousei: Freaking out? Mei: Y-Yeah... I... Um... Mei: ...... Mei: Oh, gosh... I'm so nervous... Mei: U-Umm... I think it would take too long to explain myself, so... h-here! Mei: Yes. It's... my Valentine's Day gift... to you. Kousei: Chocolate! Mei: Y-Yes. It's chocolate, and it's, um... handmade. Kousei: Handmade! Mei: Wow, you're really excited about this... Suzune-san taught me how to make it, so it should taste alright... I think. Kousei: Oh... Is that why you've been going home together lately? Mei: Yeah. I've been going to her apartment so she could teach me. Mei: She's also been helping me by asking you about your preferences and stuff... Kousei: My preferences? Oh, wait. Mei: Ahaha... Sorry. I guess I just felt kind of embarrassed... Kousei: Is that why the others said they weren't giving me any chocolate this year? So this would be a surprise? Mei: What? I don't know anything about that... Mei: But the others knew I was planning on giving you my own chocolate, so... I guess that could be why they did that... Kousei: Phew. I thought for sure you hated me or something... Mei: Wh-What?! Of course not! Why would you think that? Kousei: I mean, you've been avoiding me lately, haven't you? Mei: I-I wasn't... I mean... Well, maybe a little... Kousei: See? Mei: That's only because I didn't want you to find out I was preparing chocolate for you... Mei: But... I'm sorry for acting so weird. I didn't mean to give you the wrong idea. Kousei: It's alright. I've been really anxious these past few days, so it's a relief to know the truth. Mei: Urk... I'm sorry... Kousei: Handmade chocolate, though... This is more than I expected. Thank you. Mei: Um, if you'd like... you're welcome to go ahead and eat it... Kousei: Right now? Mei: Yeah. I actually brought you a fork too. Kousei: To be honest, I was planning to go home and savor it there... Mei: N-No, please! You can't! You can't keep me waiting that long! Mei: My heart's already pounding so fast it's about to explode! Mei: I need to know how you think it tastes right now... or else I'm going to die! Kousei: A-Alright. I'll have a bite... Mei: Please do! There are two inside, so at least try one of them! Right now! Mei: Something like that. It's called a chocolate fondant. Kousei: Sounds fancy. Was it hard to make? Mei: Not at all. Suzune-san was there to guide me through every single step. Mei: Ah, but just for the record--I made this all by myself! And I think I did a pretty good job! Mei: Though, um... it was a lot crispier on the outside when it came out of the oven, but it might be a bit soggy by now. Mei: But it shouldn't taste bad! This was Suzune-san's own personal recipe! I baked it with the utmost care! Mei: The flavor should be to your liking as well! So p-please, go ahead and try some! Kousei: Alright... don't mind if I do then. Mei: H-Help yourself! Kousei: ...... Mei: H-Hello? Kousei: ...... Mei: Senpai? Kousei: ...... Mei: Um... Does it... taste bad? Kousei: It's delicious. Mei: R-Really? Oh, thank goodness! Kousei: Oh god... It's so delicious... Mei: Wait, what? Huh? Kousei: How? How can something taste THIS good?! Mei: O-Oh, come on... You're exaggerating... Kousei: *sniffle*... Mei: Wait, are you crying? You're not pretending, are you? No way. Like, seriously? You're seriously crying? Kousei: I can't help it... Mei: O-Okay? Kousei: Everyone kept saying they wouldn't be giving me any chocolate... Mei: Oh... right. They said it'd be a hassle to get return gifts for everyone. Kousei: Even Nozomi, who usually gives me chocolates every year... gave me nothing. Mei: Wait, every year? Oh, right. You and Nozomi-chan are childhood friends. Kousei: Yeah, but she said she'd only been giving them to me out of force of habit... Mei: Oh... Err... I'm not sure what to say to that. Kousei: In the end, the only person who gave me chocolates was you... And handmade chocolate too... Kousei: Thank you... Thank you, Hiuchidani-san! Mei: I didn't think you'd be THIS emotional... but I'm glad you like it. Mei: But I can't say I was expecting you to start crying... It's a little, um, creepy. Kousei: Yeah, I know. I guess I tried too hard to sell it. Mei: Ah! I KNEW you were pretending, you stinker! Mei: Do you really mean that? Kousei: Yeah. I mean it. Seriously. Kousei: I could finish off both these chocolates right here if I'm not careful. Mei: Phew... Kousei: There's no way you could've gone wrong with Suzune-san's recipe. Mei: Yeah, but still... Kousei: Besides, even if it DID taste bad, I'd never say it to your face. Mei: What? So it really DOES taste bad?! Kousei: No, no. It's delicious. Really. Mei: *sigh*... My heart's pounding so much. Like, I've been feeling so anxious lately. That's why I've been acting so weird... Mei: When I was making the chocolate by hand, I began to understand how you feel, Senpai. Mei: Making food for someone else to eat is incredibly stressful and nerve-wracking... Mei: But it's also really fun, trying to make something that the person will like. Mei: And when you do get that confirmation from them that they like it... Mei: It makes you happier than words can describe! Kousei: I already told you. Why don't you believe me? Mei: Because I'm worried! Kousei: Didn't you taste it yourself beforehand? Mei: Well, yeah. I tried one I made from the same batch, but still... Kousei: It was delicious, wasn't it? Mei: It was, but this one's gone all cold! It's not FRESH! Kousei: Even so, it tastes delicious. Mei: Really? Really, really? Kousei: If you're really that worried about the taste, why don't you try some yourself? Kousei: See? I told you. Mei: Phew... Wait. Ah... Ahh! Kousei: What? Mei: Th-Th-Th-That was... an i-i-indirect k-ki--! Kousei: Oh, right. Sorry. You're pretty sensitive about these sorts of things, aren't you? Mei: O-O-Oh, no! It doesn't bothe--well... i-it does, I guess... Kousei: My bad. I totally forgot. Mei: I-I mean... As long as it's you, I... Mei: ...... Mei: U-U-Umm! Kousei: Hm? Mei: Suzune-san told me something... Kousei: Yeah? Mei: She said that you'd be happy receiving any kind of chocolate for Valentine's Day... Kousei: It's true. I'm pretty thrilled right now. Thank you, seriously. Mei: You're welcome... But she also said that... if I gave you handmade chocolate... Mei: Then... Umm... Kousei: Hm? Mei: Then you'd... umm! Kousei: Yeah? Mei: You'd think that... it meant I had genuine feelings for you... Kousei: O-Oh, come on! I can't believe she told you that too! Mei: Y-Yes... That's what she said... Kousei: I, er, I mean... I was only half-joking when I said that... Mei: You were... joking? Kousei: Y-Yeah. I was just messing with her... Kousei: B-But don't worry! I'm not dumb enough to think you like me just because of a couple chocolates! Mei: ...... Mei: I wouldn't mind... if you thought I did... though. Kousei: O-Okay? Kousei: ...... Kousei: Wait, what?! Mei: ...... Kousei: ...... Kousei: ...... Mei: Um... Mei: ...... Mei: During our girls' night out the other day... everyone kept asking me about that time we went to the pool together... Mei: Eventually, the conversation turned to... whether or not I had f-feelings for you, Senpai... Mei: I said I didn't know... but everyone else said it was obvious that I did... Mei: I thought they might be right... but I've never had any sort of romantic experience before... so I wasn't sure. Mei: I can't say I really understand my own feelings... but at the very least, I do know that you're a very important person to me. Mei: That's... what I wanted to tell you today. Mei: But... Mei: ...... Mei: Just now, I realized that... I really do... love you, Senpai. Mei: I mean, love is supposed to make your heart pound, isn't it? But when I'm with you, it's almost the opposite... I feel so relaxed that I thought it couldn't be love. Mei: But right now... my heart is pounding like crazy. Even though all I'm doing is telling you how I feel... my chest feels like it's about to burst. Mei: When I made up my mind to give you these chocolates... and when I decided to ask Suzune-san to teach me how to make them... Mei: While I practiced... This morning... During work... And while I was sitting here waiting for you earlier too... Mei: My heart wouldn't stop pounding. Mei: You wouldn't believe how nervous I felt. Mei: The truth is... I've had feelings for you all this time. Mei: So it's time I worked up the courage to say it. Mei: I... I think I love you, Senpai. Mei: No, wait... That doesn't sound right... Mei: ...... Mei: Senpai... I love you. Mei: I love the way you thank me, even when I've barely done anything... Mei: I love the way you're so nice to me, and lend an ear to all my worries... Mei: And I love so many other things about you too. Mei: So please... Mei: ...... Mei: Please... go out with me. Mei: Please... take me as your girlfriend. Mei: I... want to be with you from now on, Senpai. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Right now... my heart's also hammering like crazy. Kousei: When I thought you were avoiding me... it made me feel so lonely and so worried. Kousei: I was afraid you didn't like me, and I became really depressed. Kousei: Especially when you ran off without giving me any chocolate. Kousei: But then--you messaged to ask if we could meet. My heart wouldn't stop pounding on the way here. Kousei: This whole day's been a roller coaster of emotions for me. Kousei: But if what I'm feeling is the same thing you are... then I'm in love too. Kousei: In love with you, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Ah... Urk... Kousei: I love you too, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: S-So... Kousei: I want you to go out with me. Mei: ...... Mei: Ahhh... Mei: I'm a total mess of emotions right now... Kousei: Me too... My face must be burning up right now. Mei: ...... Kousei: ...... Mei: ...... Kousei: Uh... if you don't mind... Mei: Huh? Kousei: Could I call you by your first name? It'd feel oddly formal... if I kept using your last name. Mei: Y-Yeah, I agree... Go ahead. You don't have to use an honorific either... if you don't want. Kousei: Oh... Mei: Yeah. You can just call me Mei. Kousei: M... M-M-M... Mei: You're stammering so much... Kousei: I-I can't help it. I've never called you this before... Mei: That's fine. I can be patient. Kousei: M-Mei... Mei: There you go. Ehehe... Kousei: What about you? Mei: Huh? Kousei: Will you start calling me by my name? Mei: Senpai? Kousei: That's not what it says on my birth certificate. Mei: Urk... Mei: ...... Mei: Kousei... san? Kousei: You can drop the honorific too. Mei: Well... I mean, I'm younger than you, so... Mei: But maybe I could call you Kou-kun instead-- Mei: No, wait. That's even more embarrassing. Kousei: Yeah... That's pretty embarrassing for me too. Mei: Well, for now... I'm only going to use your first name when we're alone together. Kousei: A-Alright. I guess we wouldn't want the others to tease us about it. Mei: E-Exactly. Kousei: ...... Mei: ...... Kousei: Y-Yeah. I mean, if that's okay with you... Mei: O-Of course it is! Mei: ...... Mei: Finally... I'm your girlfriend! ",

I think it would take too long to explain myself, so... h-here! Mei: Yes. It's... my Valentine's Day gift... to you. Kousei: Chocolate! Mei: Y-Yes. It's chocolate, and it's, um... handmade. Kousei: Handmade! Mei: Wow, you're really excited about this... Suzune-san taught me how to make it, so it should taste alright... I think. Kousei: Oh... Is that why you've been going home together lately? Mei: Yeah. I've been going to her apartment so she could teach me. Mei: She's also been helping me by asking you about your preferences and stuff... Kousei: My preferences? Oh, wait. Mei: Ahaha... Sorry. I guess I just felt kind of embarrassed... Kousei: Is that why the others said they weren't giving me any chocolate this year? So this would be a surprise? Mei: What? I don't know anything about that... Mei: But the others knew I was planning on giving you my own chocolate, so... I guess that could be why they did that... Kousei: Phew. I thought for sure you hated me or something... Mei: Wh-What?! Of course not! Why would you think that? Kousei: I mean, you've been avoiding me lately, haven't you? Mei: I-I wasn't... I mean... Well, maybe a little... Kousei: See? Mei: That's only because I didn't want you to find out I was preparing chocolate for you... Mei: But... I'm sorry for acting so weird. I didn't mean to give you the wrong idea. Kousei: It's alright. I've been really anxious these past few days, so it's a relief to know the truth. Mei: Urk... I'm sorry... Kousei: Handmade chocolate, though... This is more than I expected. Thank you. Mei: Um, if you'd like... you're welcome to go ahead and eat it... Kousei: Right now? Mei: Yeah. I actually brought you a fork too. Kousei: To be honest, I was planning to go home and savor it there... Mei: N-No, please! You can't! You can't keep me waiting that long! Mei: My heart's already pounding so fast it's about to explode! Mei: I need to know how you think it tastes right now... or else I'm going to die! Kousei: A-Alright. I'll have a bite... Mei: Please do! There are two inside, so at least try one of them! Right now! Mei: Something like that. It's called a chocolate fondant. Kousei: Sounds fancy. Was it hard to make? Mei: Not at all. Suzune-san was there to guide me through every single step. Mei: Ah, but just for the record--I made this all by myself! And I think I did a pretty good job! Mei: Though, um... it was a lot crispier on the outside when it came out of the oven, but it might be a bit soggy by now. Mei: But it shouldn't taste bad! This was Suzune-san's own personal recipe! I baked it with the utmost care! Mei: The flavor should be to your liking as well! So p-please, go ahead and try some! Kousei: Alright... don't mind if I do then. Mei: H-Help yourself! Kousei: ...... Mei: H-Hello? Kousei: ...... Mei: Senpai? Kousei: ...... Mei: Um... Does it... taste bad? Kousei: It's delicious. Mei: R-Really? Oh, thank goodness! Kousei: Oh god... It's so delicious... Mei: Wait, what? Huh? Kousei: How? How can something taste THIS good?! Mei: O-Oh, come on... You're exaggerating... Kousei: *sniffle*... Mei: Wait, are you crying? You're not pretending, are you? No way. Like, seriously? You're seriously crying? Kousei: I can't help it... Mei: O-Okay? Kousei: Everyone kept saying they wouldn't be giving me any chocolate... Mei: Oh... right. They said it'd be a hassle to get return gifts for everyone. Kousei: Even Nozomi, who usually gives me chocolates every year... gave me nothing. Mei: Wait, every year? Oh, right. You and Nozomi-chan are childhood friends. Kousei: Yeah, but she said she'd only been giving them to me out of force of habit... Mei: Oh... Err... I'm not sure what to say to that. Kousei: In the end, the only person who gave me chocolates was you... And handmade chocolate too... Kousei: Thank you... Thank you, Hiuchidani-san! Mei: I didn't think you'd be THIS emotional... but I'm glad you like it. Mei: But I can't say I was expecting you to start crying... It's a little, um, creepy. Kousei: Yeah, I know. I guess I tried too hard to sell it. Mei: Ah! I KNEW you were pretending, you stinker! Mei: Do you really mean that? Kousei: Yeah. I mean it. Seriously. Kousei: I could finish off both these chocolates right here if I'm not careful. Mei: Phew... Kousei: There's no way you could've gone wrong with Suzune-san's recipe. Mei: Yeah, but still... Kousei: Besides, even if it DID taste bad, I'd never say it to your face. Mei: What? So it really DOES taste bad?! Kousei: No, no. It's delicious. Really. Mei: *sigh*... My heart's pounding so much. Like, I've been feeling so anxious lately. That's why I've been acting so weird... Mei: When I was making the chocolate by hand, I began to understand how you feel, Senpai. Mei: Making food for someone else to eat is incredibly stressful and nerve-wracking... Mei: But it's also really fun, trying to make something that the person will like. Mei: And when you do get that confirmation from them that they like it... Mei: It makes you happier than words can describe! Kousei: I already told you. Why don't you believe me? Mei: Because I'm worried! Kousei: Didn't you taste it yourself beforehand? Mei: Well, yeah. I tried one I made from the same batch, but still... Kousei: It was delicious, wasn't it? Mei: It was, but this one's gone all cold! It's not FRESH! Kousei: Even so, it tastes delicious. Mei: Really? Really, really? Kousei: If you're really that worried about the taste, why don't you try some yourself? Kousei: See? I told you. Mei: Phew... Wait. Ah... Ahh! Kousei: What? Mei: Th-Th-Th-That was... an i-i-indirect k-ki--! Kousei: Oh, right. Sorry. You're pretty sensitive about these sorts of things, aren't you? Mei: O-O-Oh, no! It doesn't bothe--well... i-it does, I guess... Kousei: My bad. I totally forgot. Mei: I-I mean... As long as it's you, I... Mei: ...... Mei: U-U-Umm! Kousei: Hm? Mei: Suzune-san told me something... Kousei: Yeah? Mei: She said that you'd be happy receiving any kind of chocolate for Valentine's Day... Kousei: It's true. I'm pretty thrilled right now. Thank you, seriously. Mei: You're welcome... But she also said that... if I gave you handmade chocolate... Mei: Then... Umm... Kousei: Hm? Mei: Then you'd... umm! Kousei: Yeah? Mei: You'd think that... it meant I had genuine feelings for you... Kousei: O-Oh, come on! I can't believe she told you that too! Mei: Y-Yes... That's what she said... Kousei: I, er, I mean... I was only half-joking when I said that... Mei: You were... joking? Kousei: Y-Yeah. I was just messing with her... Kousei: B-But don't worry! I'm not dumb enough to think you like me just because of a couple chocolates! Mei: ...... Mei: I wouldn't mind... if you thought I did... though. Kousei: O-Okay? Kousei: ...... Kousei: Wait, what?! Mei: ...... Kousei: ...... Kousei: ...... Mei: Um... Mei: ...... Mei: During our girls' night out the other day... everyone kept asking me about that time we went to the pool together... Mei: Eventually, the conversation turned to... whether or not I had f-feelings for you, Senpai... Mei: I said I didn't know... but everyone else said it was obvious that I did... Mei: I thought they might be right... but I've never had any sort of romantic experience before... so I wasn't sure. Mei: I can't say I really understand my own feelings... but at the very least, I do know that you're a very important person to me. Mei: That's... what I wanted to tell you today. Mei: But... Mei: ...... Mei: Just now, I realized that... I really do... love you, Senpai. Mei: I mean, love is supposed to make your heart pound, isn't it? But when I'm with you, it's almost the opposite... I feel so relaxed that I thought it couldn't be love. Mei: But right now... my heart is pounding like crazy. Even though all I'm doing is telling you how I feel... my chest feels like it's about to burst. Mei: When I made up my mind to give you these chocolates... and when I decided to ask Suzune-san to teach me how to make them... Mei: While I practiced... This morning... During work... And while I was sitting here waiting for you earlier too... Mei: My heart wouldn't stop pounding. Mei: You wouldn't believe how nervous I felt. Mei: The truth is... I've had feelings for you all this time. Mei: So it's time I worked up the courage to say it. Mei: I... I think I love you, Senpai. Mei: No, wait... That doesn't sound right... Mei: ...... Mei: Senpai... I love you. Mei: I love the way you thank me, even when I've barely done anything... Mei: I love the way you're so nice to me, and lend an ear to all my worries... Mei: And I love so many other things about you too. Mei: So please... Mei: ...... Mei: Please... go out with me. Mei: Please... take me as your girlfriend. Mei: I... want to be with you from now on, Senpai. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Right now... my heart's also hammering like crazy. Kousei: When I thought you were avoiding me... it made me feel so lonely and so worried. Kousei: I was afraid you didn't like me, and I became really depressed. Kousei: Especially when you ran off without giving me any chocolate. Kousei: But then--you messaged to ask if we could meet. My heart wouldn't stop pounding on the way here. Kousei: This whole day's been a roller coaster of emotions for me. Kousei: But if what I'm feeling is the same thing you are... then I'm in love too. Kousei: In love with you, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Ah... Urk... Kousei: I love you too, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: S-So... Kousei: I want you to go out with me. Mei: ...... Mei: Ahhh... Mei: I'm a total mess of emotions right now... Kousei: Me too... My face must be burning up right now. Mei: ...... Kousei: ...... Mei: ...... Kousei: Uh... if you don't mind... Mei: Huh? Kousei: Could I call you by your first name? It'd feel oddly formal... if I kept using your last name. Mei: Y-Yeah, I agree... Go ahead. You don't have to use an honorific either... if you don't want. Kousei: Oh... Mei: Yeah. You can just call me Mei. Kousei: M... M-M-M... Mei: You're stammering so much... Kousei: I-I can't help it. I've never called you this before... Mei: That's fine. I can be patient. Kousei: M-Mei... Mei: There you go. Ehehe... Kousei: What about you? Mei: Huh? Kousei: Will you start calling me by my name? Mei: Senpai? Kousei: That's not what it says on my birth certificate. Mei: Urk... Mei: ...... Mei: Kousei... san? Kousei: You can drop the honorific too. Mei: Well... I mean, I'm younger than you, so... Mei: But maybe I could call you Kou-kun instead-- Mei: No, wait. That's even more embarrassing. Kousei: Yeah... That's pretty embarrassing for me too. Mei: Well, for now... I'm only going to use your first name when we're alone together. Kousei: A-Alright. I guess we wouldn't want the others to tease us about it. Mei: E-Exactly. Kousei: ...... Mei: ...... Kousei: Y-Yeah. I mean, if that's okay with you... Mei: O-Of course it is! Mei: ...... Mei: Finally... I'm your girlfriend! , Suzune: Hey there. Kanna: Good morning. Kousei: H-Hey, Akizuki-san. Kanna: Akizuki-san, you said? Kousei: Urk... Kanna: What are you, scared? Kousei: No, I'm not! Kousei: G-Good morning, Kanna. Kanna: Good morning to you too, Kousei-san. , Kanna: Just quit bellyaching and go already, Takamine-san. Natsume: Of course not. Why are you being so negative? Natsume: If anything, she'd be disappointed if you refused to go with her. You don't have to be a girl to understand that. Kousei: Fine. I'll try asking Nozomi herself then. Kousei: What?! That's a little inconsiderate, don't you think?! Natsume: I doubt she'll mind if it's you. Suzune: Enough excuses already. Get going! Kousei: Alright, alright. Fine. Kanna: Mikado-san? You can come out now. Mikado: Good grief. I would highly appreciate if you kept me out of your silly schemes. Kanna: Now, now. Just think of this as our Christmas present to Takamine-san. Suzune: All this work to set up a single date. Natsume: Alright. Back to work, everyone. Kousei: Hey! Nozomi! Nozomiii! Nozomi: What are you doing here? I thought you were at work! Kousei: Well, about that... Nozomi: They totally were! I just know it! Kousei: Huh? Why do you say that? Nozomi: Don't you think it's fishy? Why would Mikado-san suddenly disappear, knowing full well how busy the cafe would be today? Nozomi: Especially since he knew Mei-chan and I wouldn't be working today. Kousei: Yeah, I guess I see what you mean... Nozomi: What it is, Kousei-kun? Kousei: Look at this. Nozomi: Now there's something I haven't heard before... Kousei: I don't think it's a common expression, no. Nozomi: R-Right. If we really do go to Mouse Land together, then-- Nozomi: Th-That means I'll be taking your f-first time! Nozomi: Come to think of it, this means I'll be giving you my dating v-virginity too! Nozomi: Ahhhhhh! I can't believe this is happening! Nozomi: That time my late-blooming older childhood friend was reincarnated in another world as a cunning playboy! Kousei: What is this, some light novel? Kousei: You can call someone else right now to go with you. Kousei: You've got tons of friends, right? At least one of them must be free tonight. \n\nWhile these examples may provide some guidance, evaluate their relevance to the current conversation.
