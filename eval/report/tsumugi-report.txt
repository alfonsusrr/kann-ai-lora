            "Meguru: Good morning. Tsumugi: Morning. Touko: Good morning, Ayachi-san! Shuuji: Morning. Nene: Everyone's here? Let's get going then. Meguru: I can't wait to see your apartment! I wonder what it's like. Tsumugi: She lives by herself, so I'm sure it's not anything special. Nene: It's just your standard one-bedroom apartment. Tsumugi: Oh, yeah? As a girl, I'm sure it's nice having a separate bedroom. Touko: Mufufu... Is the young man disappointed to hear that? Shuuji: Not at all... Touko: Really? You looked a little disappointed to me. Shuuji: If anything, I'm relieved. I'll feel less nervous this way. Touko: Oh, you can be honest with me. I won't tell anyone. Come on, come on! Shuuji: Huh?! Ahh! Wh-What are you doing, Senpai?! Touko: Really? Shuuji: Really. I mean, being a healthy young man, I do think those things from time to time... But I'm a chicken, okay?! Touko: You really are honest, huh? Shuuji: Besides, we're having a study session today. Don't say give me any weird ideas. Shuuji: Come on, Senpai. We're gonna get left behind. Touko: Yeah, yeah. Shuuji: I'm coming. Tsumugi, Touko, Shuuji: Oooh! Meguru: This place is friggin' huge! How the heck is this a \"standard\" one-bedroom apartment?! Shuuji: I mean, technically it IS a one-bedroom apartment... Shuuji: But, man... Meguru: Ah, okay. Will do... Tsumugi: It's hard to settle down in a room this big. Touko: My, oh my... I'm surprised as well. Nene: ...Is that so? Nene: I made sure to clean up in advance, since I knew you were coming over. It's usually a little messier. Meguru: Let me guess; you stuffed everything into your bedroom closet? Kinda like you see in manga. Nene: In a way. There are some places I may not have cleaned up as much. Nene: So with that in mind, I would like to you not to go digging around. Meguru: Hearing that makes me wanna search your apartment a little. Like, maybe that drawer over there... Nene: ――― Meguru: J-Just kidding! Just a little joke, haha... Meguru: It's not the same when a guy does it. There is a big difference. Touko: You can't. We've come here today to study. Don't let yourself get sidetracked. Meguru: 'Kaaay... Tsumugi: Okay, should we get right into it, then? Nene: Please use the desk over there. I'm going to prepare tea for us. Shuuji: I'll help you. Nene: You don't have to. I can do that alone. Please just sit down. Shuuji: Yeah? Nene: Oh, thank you. Nene: Repeating that process is the best way to study this, in my opinion. You can learn a lot by solving the same problems every day. Meguru: Still, there's so much to memorize... Nene: Then... try focusing on memorizing everything from here to here first. It'll be easier to remember the rest once you have the basics down. Meguru: Ugh... Roger that... Shuuji: Is there something you're not getting? Tsumugi: Ah, yeah. You see, I don't know how to do this recurrence relation problem here. Shuuji: Yeah, that one's a little tricky. Tsumugi: Hoshina-kun, can you figure it out? Shuuji: Probably. I understood the concept pretty well when we were taught it in class. Though, now that you're asking me about it, I'm not so sure... Tsumugi: How about we try to solve it together, then? Tsumugi: Though, it'll probably be you doing all the work. Shuuji: That's fine. Instead of explaining it, I'll solve the problem while telling you what I'm doing. It might be a little hard to follow, but bear with me. Tsumugi: Don't worry about that. I'm sure I'll remember it that way, even if it's not the best way. Shuuji: Let's give it a try, then. Tsumugi: Yeah. Thank you. Shuuji: Let's see... First, we need a characteristic polynomial... Tsumugi: Yeah, you got it right! Amazing! Shuuji: Yeah? Phew... Tsumugi: Umm... Sorry. I still don't really get it. Shuuji: It's okay. Shuuji: Let's try an easier problem... Actually, maybe you need to brush up on the basics of recurrence relation. Tsumugi: I guess I do, huh? Shuuji: Have you already tried and struggled with the easier problems? Tsumugi: Yeah. Recurrence relation hadn't been taught yet at my previous school, but Himematsu High was already past the basics when I transferred. Shuuji: Ahh. Yeah, that'll do it. Tsumugi: Umm... Could you teach me? Shuuji: Of course. That's why we're here. Tsumugi: Thanks! Shuuji: Then let's get right into it and start from the beginning... Tsumugi: ...... Shuuji: What's up? Tsumugi: Huh? What do you mean? Shuuji: Oh, I just thought that you looked pretty happy for some reason. Tsumugi: Yeah? I guess I am. Getting together with everyone and studying together is so much fun. Tsumugi: Ehehe... I'm having a great time. Tsumugi: I don't know how to describe it, but, umm... It makes me feel better to have someone I can share a forbidden secret with. Shuuji: \"Forbidden secret\" has a pretty suggestive ring to it, you know. Tsumugi: Huh?! Tsumugi: Ah! Th-That's not how I meant it! Not one bit! Shuuji: It actually hurts if you deny it that much... Tsumugi: S-S-S-Sorry! I didn't mean to hurt you! Tsumugi: I told you that's not what I meant! Geez! Tsumugi: Are you doing this on purpose now? You're teasing me, aren't you? Shuuji: I didn't mean to tease you... You were just so cute that I got a little carried away. Tsumugi: ～～～～～?!?!?! I knew you were teasing me! Liar! You meanie! Shuuji: I am. I'm sorry. I got a little too carried away. Tsumugi: ...... Tsumugi: I'm so done with you. I thought that maybe I could help you at Classical Japanese since I'm not bad at it, but not anymore! Shuuji: What?! Wait, I could really use the help with that! Please! Tsumugi: It's your own fault for being a meanie! Touko: Huh? What's wrong? Is there anything you need help with? Shuuji: It's about the translation of \"shikareba\" here. Touko: Lemme see... Ahh, this is Konjaku Monogatari. Touko: It's the perfect tense form of the irregular verb \"shikari.\" By adding on the \"ba,\" it becomes a conjunction that can mean both \"it seems\" and \"by the way.\" Touko: You just need to pick the translation that fits the sentence. Shuuji: Umm... Okay, so I guess it would be the former in this case. \"By the way\" would be weird. Touko: Yup, that's right. It's \"so it seems.\" But you shouldn't be content with just that. You need to learn the full meaning of these words, okay? Shuuji: *sigh* Classical Japanese is such a hassle. Touko: You're not wrong. There's a lot you have to learn. Oh, maybe the Classical Japanese would stick better if you compare it side by side to a Modern Japanese translation. Touko: Besides, when it comes to Modern Japanese, you can be tested on just about anything, but there are only so many Classical Japanese works you can be tested on, right? Touko: It is still quite a lot... But reading just one work can come in handy if you're lucky. Shuuji: Oh, that's true. Shuuji: Really? Then don't mind if I... No, wait. You can just tell me which book it is. I'll get my own copy. Shuuji: You need yours for your own studies, right? Touko: You really don't have to worry about that. Shuuji: No, I couldn't possibly. Touko: But, I mean... Shuuji: What is it? Touko: I need to repay you in some form. Shuuji: Repay me? For what? Touko: You noticed what was going on inside her, right? Shuuji: ...... Touko: You didn't actually invite me out so you could eat a parfait, right? Shuuji: That wasn't a lie... I really did want to try their parfaits. Touko: But there was a deeper reason for you inviting both me and Koshiji-san, wasn't there? Touko: I really don't see it that way. And besides, I'm not upset about it. Touko: Koshiji-san became the new president thanks to that. I'm actually thankful to you. Shuuji: Oh, no, it was nothing. I didn't do anything special. Touko: That's not true. I never noticed her feelings myself... I've always had a hard time with that kind of thing. Touko: If it wasn't for you... I might have done something really cruel and irreversible to Koshiji-san. Touko: So, I'm really thankful to you. Shuuji: I don't know about that... Shuuji: I didn't really do much, so I just feel embarrassed and awkward when you talk about repaying me. Touko: Are you sure? But it'll weigh on my mind if I don't... And I can't repay you with sexual favors... Hmm... Shuuji: Repaying me with sexual favors would put me in an even more awkward position, so please don't. Touko: Okay♪ Then I'll keep teaching you Classical Japanese instead～ Touko: Listen up. \"Ikasamani\" is the continuative form of the adjective \"ikasamanari\" and means \"how\"― Shuuji: H-Hold on a second! Touko: What is it? Is there something you didn't understand? Shuuji: No, that's not it... You're just really close, Senpai. Touko: Am I? But we only have the one textbook. I need to get close to see. Shuuji: I mean, yeah, I guess, but... Shuuji: Wha?! Shuuji: ...Are you sticking this close to me on purpose? Touko: Oh my, what a perv you are. You should get your mind out of the gutter. Shuuji: You know full well what you're doing! Don't you?! Touko: Hmm? Doing what? Shuuji: Err, well, umm... You're purposely... Touko: Come on. I want to hear what you think I'm doing from straight from your cute little mouth～ Shuuji: Y-Your... Touko: My? Shuuji: B-Boo― Touko: Boo? Shuuji: I can't say it! I can't possibly tell you that your boobs are almost touching my arm and that I can't stop thinking about your cleavage! Touko: But you just did. Shuuji: Wh-Who cares about that. Anyway, you seriously have to cut this out! Touko: It's so adorable how red your face is. It makes me want to tease you more. Shuuji: I knew you were doing it on purpose! Touko: Oh, come on. Don't get so angry. Or... do you really not like it? Shuuji: Well, err... I mean, it's not like I DON'T like it... Touko: You really are an honest boy. Shuuji: But it makes me anxious, so please stop. Didn't you say you couldn't do anything sexual? Touko: This was all just an accident. Nothing worth making a fuss over. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: No thanks. Touko: Ahh, you hesitated for a second. You perv～ I was just kidding～ Shuuji: ...You enjoy teasing people a lot, don't you? I could tell back when we ate parfaits together. Touko: That's not true. I was just doting on my cute underclassman a little to show my love. Yup, love♪ Shuuji: Oh, well, if it's out of love... Shuuji: Psh, please. I'm honored, but I seriously can't concentrate that way. So please, spare me. Touko: That's too bad. Then I guess we'll keep studying at a normal distance. Shuuji: ...Thank you. "

Hideaki: Well, call me if you ever do plan on playing or singing anywhere. I'll come and listen. Shuuji: Huh? Like, I'm obviously not gonna play again, but can't you join her as a drummer? Hideaki: Look... I've been reminded of a harsh lesson through this... Nobody cares about the drummer! Shuuji: Ah... Nene: O-Oh no, I'm really not that good... I was only able to sing well thanks to the rest of the band. Hideaki: Yeah... But it's way too late for me to switch tracks now. Wakana: There's no way girls would swarm you like that either way. The vocalist should have some class. Hideaki: Especially not if I'm trying to sing while drumming. So yeah, I've officially given up on music for the second time on Saturday. Shuuji: That's kind of a waste, but I guess I have no room to talk since I'm quitting too. Wakana: Exactly. Shuuji: Hm? Nene: E-Excuse me for a moment. I need to talk to Hoshina-kun. Nene: So, it would appear that some of my fragments have returned again. Shuuji: Huh? You mean the fragments I absorbed? Nene: Yes. I haven't received fragments from anywhere else lately. Nene: Absolutely. I only noticed it last night, but... Nene: It must have been the Halloween party when it happened.  Shuuji: ...Now that you mention it, I think I felt a strange sensation around when the party was ending. Nene: Which means the successful party and performance has filled up your heart somewhat again. Shuuji: It's true that I felt a sense of fulfillment and accomplishment. Hmm... Shuuji: Judging by the amount in the bottle, I suppose not all fragments have returned yet, huh? Nene: Yes, unfortunately not. Shuuji: You're not about to tell me to keep playing in the band, are you? I doubt throwing another party would do anything for me. Nene: ...Could you keep going? Shuuji: No. No way. That may have been a fulfilling experience but to continue would be a whole nother story. Shuuji: Like, you wouldn't want me to ask you to keep singing, would you?  Nene: No, I wouldn't. You don't have to worry. I won't make any such requests of you. Shuuji: ...Sorry. I wish I could just give you back these fragments right now. Nene: It's okay. Even if it's little by little, I'm just happy they're coming back. Shuuji: Yeah, but the longer it takes to return your fragments, the longer you'll, umm... keep getting those fits of arousal. Nene: ――― Shuuji: Okay, don't say it! I already know I went too far! Nene: Exactly. My pain would be over if you returned them to me right now... And yet, and yet... Could it be you actually enjoy making me m-m-masturbate? Shuuji: NO! Absolutely not! I'm trying to return them to you as soon as humanly possible! Nene: That look on your face... You don't really want to return them, do you? I see how it is. That must be why you're quitting the band... Shuuji: Now, hold on! You're way off the mark! Please bring back the calm and understanding Ayachi-san! Kanae: Hey, you two. What are you doing outside the classroom? Get your heads out of the party mentality and start focusing on school now. Shuuji: Oh, sorry! Come on, Ayachi-san! Nene: Phew... I'm sorry for acting out this morning. Shuuji: No, it was my fault for bringing it up... Shuuji: Yeah, you're right. So in return... Wait, actually, that's not the right phrasing. Shuuji: Anyway, I've recalled something else. Nene: Okay...? Shuuji: You haven't retrieved fragments from Inaba-san yet, right? Nene: Oh, right. You're correct. I haven't yet. Shuuji: It wasn't possible before, but I wondered about whether it'd be now. Shuuji: It seems like she's getting along better with her classmates lately. Nene: ...Is that so? Shuuji: Yeah. A lot of them voted for her during the party. Shuuji: She finished in eighth place thanks to them. They all surrounded her and complimented her, kinda like what our classmates did with you this morning. Seeing that reminded me about this. Nene: Oh... I didn't know that. Nene: But now that you mention it, she did say that they were going out to eat cake together. Shuuji: Yeah, that is why I wondered if she had any fragments to collect. Nene: ...Yeah, it sounds like retrieval should be possible. Nene: Thank you for the suggestion; it was very helpful. I hadn't thought of that myself. Shuuji: Oh, you're welcome. Shuuji: If it means proving that I'm not stalling just so I can keep you horny, then... Nene: ――― Shuuji: Crap, I said something I shouldn't have again, didn't I?! Nene: I don't care anymore... I'm a filthy m-masturbater. That's just who I am... You don't need to sugarcoat it. Shuuji: Snap out of it! Please! Think about the fragments you may be able to retrieve! Nene: And also, I will look for a good opportunity after school to check whether retrieval is possible. Shuuji: Roger that. Nene: ...... Shuuji: Hm? What is it? Nene: Oh, nothing. I just thought you answered like Inaba-san. Shuuji: ...Oh yeah. I did, huh? That just kinda happened automatically. Nene: ...... Meguru: Hey! Wait for me! Nene: Huh? Inaba-san? Meguru: What have you two been talking about? Let me join the fun! Nene: Nngh. W-Well... Meguru: You went to the clubroom just for that? I didn't know you were such a courteous guy. So you really do care about manners, huh, Senpai? Shuuji: Hey, what's that supposed to mean? Meguru: Actually, why'd you have to be alone for that? This is kinda fishy... Shuuji: Moving on! What brings you to the clubroom? Meguru: Oh, right. I went over to your class to chat with you, but you weren't there. Then Tsumugi-senpai told me you went to the clubroom. Meguru: I thought you might be bragging to everyone about your shiny new armor, so I wanted to set the record straight and let them know I did all the work. Shuuji: What kinda reason is that? Though, I can't deny that it was all thanks to you... Shuuji: Hmm, let's see... I honestly feel bad about being the only one getting help. Shuuji: Like, what about... Ayachi-san? Nene: ...Yeah. Meguru: Oh, right. Don't worry. I'll help you too, of course! Nene: Actually... I've already got it taken care of. Nene: Anyway, Hoshina-kun, we should head back to class now. See you after school, Inaba-san. Meguru: Oh, okay... Roger... Meguru: Hmm... Shuuji: Well? How's it look? Nene: Unfortunately the bottle didn't react. It seems she hasn't yet reached the state where retrieval is possible. Shuuji: Oh, I see... Nene: Like I said before, I can only really guess, but... Nene: Probably once she has found someone she can fully open up to and trust, and vice versa. Shuuji: And she doesn't have anyone like that yet... Meguru: \"And I know how few people there are like me when it comes to friendship, socializing and all that...\" Nene: Pain...? You mean that literally? Shuuji: Yeah. I think the emotion behind that was probably something like fear or regret. Shuuji: Also, I perceived a bittersweet taste. I don't really know what emotion was behind that, but... Meguru: \"I doubt things would've went well even without the cold. Ahaha...\" Shuuji: ...I felt like it was complicated and deep-rooted. Nene: I would have to assume. She must have some deeper concerns if her getting along with her classmates isn't enough. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: ...I want to help her. Shuuji: Oh, yeah, that's certainly a factor, but I want to help her even putting the fragments aside. Shuuji: We promised her that we would help her to do something about this. Nene: ...... Nene: Okay, but I think it would be best if I left this to you. Shuuji: ...Huh? Nene: I feel like that's the best approach. After all... Nene: It seems like you're the one who's closest with her at the moment. Shuuji: W-Wait, that's not... Nene: Am I wrong? Shuuji: W-Well, like, doesn't she always latch onto you the moment she sees you? She doesn't do that with me! Shuuji: It's obvious that she really likes you. But me on the other hand... Nene: ...So then, can I leave this to you? Shuuji: R-Roger that. Shuuji: E-Er, that was on purpose this time! Nene: *stare* Tsumugi: Right. You'll get exhausted at this rate. Nene: I'm sorry... I hope this doesn't keep up for tomorrow... Touko: I think it'll let up after a day. You were pretty blunt when turning them down, so I'm sure everyone will get the message. Nene: I sure hope so... Touko: Anyway, is it alright for me to continue coming? Nene: Of course. I don't mind at all if you don't mind. Touko: I definitely don't mind. I have more free time than I know what to do with now that I've retired from the Student Council. Touko: Doing nothing but studying is so boring, so I'd love to keep coming if that's alright with you. Poor old me has nowhere else to call home anymore... Tsumugi: You're already one of us to me. I'd really like it if you kept coming. Touko: I'm so happy to hear that! Nene: Okay, then. Let's go home for today. Touko, Tsumugi: Okay. "

            "Shuuji: Shiiba-san? What brings you here? Tsumugi: We played rock-paper-scissors to determine who buys everyone's drinks, and... I lost. Tsumugi: Anyway, who was that? She's not from our class, is she? Shuuji: Koshiji-san. Have you seen the posters posted all over the hallway? Tsumugi: The election posters, you mean? Oh, right. She's the one running for election! Tsumugi: Then, she's the girl Togakushi-senpai mentioned? Shuuji: That's right. Tsumugi: Oh, that's great! I was a little worried about how that would turn out. Tsumugi: I've been wondering if there was something else we could do, but it looks like we don't need to worry anymore. Shuuji: Yeah, I think things will work out just fine from now on. Shuuji: You're so kind, though. You just transferred and you're already that worried about our school? Tsumugi: I'm not that kind... Tsumugi: But, well, it would bug me if things ended poorly without us, since we already helped out. Shuuji: I guess... What of it? Tsumugi: Oh, nothing... She didn't want to run before, so I was just wondering what made her change her mind. Tsumugi: She didn't look reluctant, from what I could tell. Do you know anything about that? Shuuji: Hm, no idea. I guess she had a change of heart? Shuuji: She looked pretty happy, so I'm sure it was a change for the better. I don't think we need to worry about it. Tsumugi: ...Yeah. You're right. It must've been a positive change. Shuuji: ...... Tsumugi: Well then, let's head back to class! Shuuji: What about the drinks you came here for? Tsumugi: Oh, that's right! They would've been so mad if I forgot! Shuuji: Here, I'll help you carry them. Tsumugi: Thanks! Koshiji: Well, things are about to get real busy for me. But I made my decision; I'm not about to back out now. Koshiji: Let's do this! Nene: The bottle's reacting. Shuuji: Think you can retrieve some fragments, then? Nene: Yes. It's a very strong response, so I'm sure we'll be able to retrieve a lot of fragments. Shuuji: Oh, well... Things happened. Shuuji: I'd really appreciate it if you didn't ask for the details, actually. Nene: Oh, well, okay. But can you answer just one question? There's something I've been wondering about. Nene: Was Koshiji-san who you were talking about yesterday? Shuuji: H-Hmm... Nene: Oh, sorry, I'm not meaning to pry. There's just something I noticed... Nene: About the fragments I've gathered... The bottle seems a little more full today than it was yesterday. Shuuji: And you haven't retrieved any fragments from anyone? Nene: Right. It's not a very big change so it may just be my imagination, but... something is telling me that it's not. Shuuji: Can the fragment count really go up on its own like that? Nene: Not normally, no. But after thinking about it, I found one possible cause... You. Shuuji: M-Me?! Nene: Or more accurately, the fragments you took from me. Don't you think it's possible that something caused some of them to return? Nene: So, I would like you to tell me; did something happen yesterday? Something out of the ordinary. Shuuji: H-Hard to say... Shuuji: A lot happened yesterday. I helped Koshiji-san come to terms with an issue that has been plaguing her for a very long time. Shuuji: She thanked me, which made me strangely happy... Maybe that's why. Nene: Oh, I see. Shuuji: Yeah. I'm really happy I joined the OC. Nene: ...I'm glad you feel that way. Shuuji: Oh, could you wait on that? Nene: Is there a problem with that? Shuuji: No, not exactly... But why not wait a little longer? Nene: Huh? What's the point in waiting? Shuuji: The other witch might show up. Nene: Sure, she might... But that seems like a long shot. Nene: Even if there is another witch, she would have to notice Koshiji-san's change. Shuuji: Yeah, but you never know. Nene: If you wish. Koshiji: That should be the last notice. Nnngh... Alright, let's head back. Shuuji: Right... Nene: Do you think this means they really haven't noticed? I could have also been reading too much into the whole second witch thing. Shuuji: Hmm... Nene: Are you sure? We could always do this another day. Shuuji: Nah, it's better to do it now. Shuuji: There are a lot of fragments at stake here. Who knows what could happen if we wait around too much. Shuuji: And this isn't just about the fragment count; it's not good for Koshiji-san's heart, is it? So you should just do it now. Nene: ...You're right. Okay then. Shuuji: S-Sorry... Nene: I'm going to get this over with quickly so I can change back into my school uniform ASAP. Shuuji: O-Okay. Nene: No way. There really is... Nene: Most likely... B-But can you believe this nonsense? Nene: Her outfit is not just tactful, but really cute too! I mean, look at what I have to wear! It's not fair! Shuuji: Is this really the time and place for that?! Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Crap! She's running away! Shuuji: W-Wait up! Shuuji: I can't just leave things like this! Shuuji: Besides, if my guess is right, we'll be able to talk it out! Nene: Wh-What guess? ? ? ?: Huh?! Whoa, hey! Shuuji: Whoa?! Shuuji: Mmrrphl... Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: ... Shuuji: ―――?!?! Shuuji: Mrr, mmmrph! ? ? ?: ...Huh? \"Mmmrph\"? Shuuji: ...... ? ? ?: ...... ? ? ?: Hey! Wh-What are you doing?! Shuuji: Mmmrph?! ? ? ?: Hyaaaah! ? ? ?: Ahh! Hey! Don't talk! It tickles! Ah, hyahh! Shuuji: ――― ? ? ?: D-Don't move, either! Just get away from me! Tsumugi: Ayachi-san, that witch just now was... you? Nene: So... you're a witch too? Tsumugi: ......Yeah. Shuuji: ...... Tsumugi: Nnnhyaah?! Tsumugi: Don't be. I mean... It's not your fault. I was the one who ran away. Tsumugi: O-Okay... Nene: And that's why you wanted to join, right? Tsumugi: ...Yeah. Nene: I see... Nene: Hoshina-kun, how did you notice that Shiiba-san is a witch? Tsumugi: Huh?! Y-You noticed?! Shuuji: Well, it's not like I knew for sure. I just had a vague idea, based on some circumstantial evidence. Nene: I see. The witch didn't have to be new. They could've been an existing witch who recently arrived. Shuuji: Since Hisashima-sensei is Shiiba-san's homeroom teacher and handled her transfer paperwork, they must've been in close contact with each other. Shuuji: But more importantly, there's something all witches share―a contract to fulfill their wish. Shuuji: And that contract comes with a price the witch must pay, right?  Nene: I see... With Shiiba-san, you think that's the way she has to dress? Shuuji: That's right. I figured that there had to be a very special reason for her being unable to wear girly clothing. Nene: And that reason is the price in her witch contract... Tsumugi: ...Yeah, you're right. Shuuji: You have it rough too, huh? Tsumugi: Seriously, why did I have to become this way... Ugh. I know, I only have myself to blame for this. Tsumugi: But anyway, I never would have guessed that you were a witch too... Nene: Yeah, this is very surprising. Tsumugi: ...Your outfit is pretty wild, huh? That's just as surprising. Nene: D-Don't misunderstand! It's not like I want I want to dress like this! Tsumugi: Yeah, I know. You can't choose your magic weapon and clothes. Nene: Argh... This is so incredibly unfair. I have to wear this nonsense while you get such a cute outfit... Nene: I wish I had an outfit like yours! Tsumugi: D-Don't tell that to me... Shuuji: Why don't you two transform back into your regular outfits before continuing? Tsumugi: Y-Yeah. Good idea, I guess... Shuuji: ...? What's wrong? Is there a problem with that? Tsumugi: No, there isn't. But, well, you know how I normally have to dress... Tsumugi: The only time I get to wear cute clothes is when I'm transformed. Shuuji: Oh yeah... You're wearing a skirt, no problem. Tsumugi: The only time I can wear cute clothes and not get sick is when I'm in my witch outfit. So, it's a little embarrassing, but it also makes me happy. Tsumugi: It's really soothing, you know? Ehehe! Nene: ...How unfair. It's so... so so so so so so unfair. Shuuji: Okay, that's enough. You're seriously freaking me out right now. Tsumugi: So, Hoshina-kun, why have you been helping Ayachi-san? Shuuji: Well, err... A lot happened. Nene: A series of events led him to finding out I'm a witch. He's been helping me out ever since. Tsumugi: Oh, yeah? Shuuji: So, what's your story? Let me guess, you had to transfer to our school because of some kind of witch-related issue? Tsumugi: Ah, no, nothing like that. I just moved here because my dad got a new job. Nene: Yeah, I expected as much. Unless there are some very special circumstances, moving only gets in the way of fragment gathering. Tsumugi: Yeah, tell me about it. I was so worried about how I'd gather fragments after finding out we were moving... Especially since I didn't know anyone here. Tsumugi: But I made new friends so quickly, and I even found a club about helping people, so... I couldn't help myself... Shuuji: Yeah, I don't blame you at all for using our club like that. Shuuji: Oh, yeah. Sorry, I basically tricked you. Shuuji: I figured that if you really were our witch, you'd maybe try to retrieve Koshiji-san's fragments. You just happened to walk in on our conversation at a good time for that. Tsumugi: Oh. I really fell for that one, didn't I? Tsumugi: Umm, I'm so sorry, Ayachi-san! I didn't mean to get in your way... Nene: Oh, no. Please don't worry about it. You didn't know, so I don't blame you for anything. Nene: Considering how rare we are, it's hard to imagine there being two witches in such a small area. I certainly didn't. Tsumugi: ...Yeah, you're right. Nene: So then, about how to proceed from here... Tsumugi: U-Umm! I don't want any trouble. And I definitely don't want to fight or race for the fragments. Tsumugi: So I won't get in the way of your fragment gathering. You've been here for much longer than I have, after all. Tsumugi: So, umm... Is it okay for me to stay in the club? Nene: That's just fine. I don't want to fight, either. I'd really like it if we could stay the same as before. Tsumugi: Th-Thank you so much! Ah, I'm so glad... I was so worried you might say no. Shuuji: ...Oh, is that why you tried to run from us? Shuuji: I'm guessing that you never planned on getting in our way; that you just happened to attempt retrieving the fragments at the same time as us, yeah? Tsumugi: Yeah, you're spot on. I thought that if I escaped, I could avoid retrieving fragments at school from now on, and just maybe stay friends with you two. Nene: Umm, about that. How about we work together instead? Tsumugi: Huh? What do you mean by that? Nene: You said you'd concede all the fragments to me, but I don't really see our school as my territory or anything. Nene: So, would you like to gather fragments together with me? Tsumugi: But I'd feel bad about that. I mean, I wouldn't want to leech off you after what I did. Nene: But it'd be a problem if you stopped gathering fragments, wouldn't it? Tsumugi: Well, yeah... That's true, but... Nene: Please don't worry about it. You would do the same if you were in my position. Besides... Nene: I can understand how you feel. I know full well how hard it can be to live with the contract's price. Shuuji: ...Yeah, you really don't have it easy with your contract. Nene: Don't remind me... Just thinking about it makes me sick. I still don't want to believe it's real. God... This sucks. Tsumugi: Actually, what is the price that you're paying? Nene: ―――! Tsumugi: Oh, um, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked that, should I? Sorry for being insensitive. Nene: O-Oh, no... I'm the one who suggested we work together, so I shouldn't keep any secrets. We should be able to trust each other... Nene: The truth is, umm, my price is...... H... Horn... Horniness. Tsumugi: Huh? A h-horny... what? Sorry, but what did you just say? Nene: Horniness... It's horniness! Tsumugi: \"Horniness\"? Horniness... Wait, horniness?! What?! Did you really just say \"horniness\"?! Nene: ...... Shuuji: Because of it, Ayachi-san, umm, how should I put this... She gets random bouts of arousal against her will. Shuuji: That also happens to be how I learned about her being a witch. Tsumugi: I-I see... That sounds like a much tougher price than mine... Nene: I don't mean to boast or argue who has it worse, but... it really is horrible. Why did it have to be this...? Tsumugi: I have the same thought sometimes... Why do our prices have to be so brutal? "

Meguru: Yeah! Come on and have a seat! Tsumugi: Ehehe, yeah. You know it? Meguru: Of course I do! It's super cute! Meguru: Are you fine with teddy bears and stuffed animals, then? Tsumugi: Huh? O-Oh, it seems like it depends on the toy. This guy seems fine. Meguru: Ooh. But you've always avoided plushies before. Hmm... So it depends on the kind... Meguru: I'll have to keep that in mind. Nene: Not since I saw her putting leaflets on the notice boards last week. Nene: Did something happen to make you worried? Tsumugi: Yeah... I might just be imagining this, but I saw her earlier, and she looked kind of depressed. Tsumugi: Like she was completely worn out. Nene: Really? She looked like she was on the road to recovery the last time I saw her. Tsumugi: Then maybe I was just imagining it... Nene: Well, why don't we check to make sure? Nene: Atsuma-san was originally my responsibility. Tsumugi: Sorry for being so weird about it. Tsumugi: But I'm glad you'll do something. Tsumugi: O-Okay! Thank you, Meguru-chan. Tsumugi: Thanks for the food! Tsumugi: But I'm used to eating by myself. It's been happening a lot lately. Tsumugi: Ever since Dad was called away on a business trip right after transferring in. Tsumugi: And Mom's back-and-forth a lot too since the transfer at her job hasn't been finalized yet. Plushie: ...... Tsumugi: Hehe, but having you with me makes everything better, Shuji-kun. Tsumugi: The food feels warmer than usual. Tsumugi: Yeah, it's delicious. "

            "Shuuji: Oh crap, I gotta get back to class! Schoolgirl D: Ayachi-san! Let's start a band together! With your heavenly voice, we'll make it big for sure! Nene: Sorry, but I'm not interested. I was just a stand-in for that one occasion. Schoolgirl D: But didn't the crowd's reaction feel great? Don't you wanna get more of that, on an even bigger stage? I know you can do it, Ayachi-san! Nene: Thank you for the compliment, but I really can't. I'm not good at being in front of crowds. Schoolgirl D: *sigh* Okay, I guess there's no changing your mind. Aww man, we could've hit it big... Schoolgirl D: Oh! But if you ever change your mind and wanna step onto the stage again, talk to me first! You gotta! Nene: *sigh* Very well. Touko: You had it tough today. Here's some tea. Drink it and let it calm your soul. Watch out, though; it's hot. Nene: Thank you, Togakushi-senpai. Nene: *blow* *sip* Ahh, wonderful... Tsumugi: And there were even more people who asked her in our classroom. Meguru: Really? Whoa, that's crazy... Nene: I'm glad that they liked my singing... I just wish they would leave me be. Touko: Now, now, this just shows how wonderfully your band played, doesn't it? Nene: Yes, and that's an honor, and I'm truly grateful, but... it's rather draining... Shuuji: In fact, I'm sure it'll be a lot calmer tomorrow, even. The party is still fresh in everyone's minds. Nene: I hope you're right... Meguru: Should we wrap things up here, then? Nene-senpai's looking pretty rough. Tsumugi: They'll be closing the club building soon, so I doubt anyone else is gonna come to us with their problems. Shuuji: There you have it, Ayachi-san. Let's call it a day so you can take it easy. Nene: ...Very well. Thank you for looking out for me. Touko: Helping people is important, but you're not going to be able to help anyone if you get sick. Touko: I'll take over tidying and locking up, so you can go straight home. Nene: ...Are you sure? Touko: Yup, just leave it to me! Nene: Well then, I'll be excusing myself. Thank you, everyone. Touko: Bye-bye～ Make sure you get some rest! Tsumugi: Wait up! I'll go home with you, just in case. Meguru: Oh, I'll come too. What about you, Senpai? Shuuji: I feel bad making Togakushi-senpai tidy up by herself, so I'll stay and help her out. Tsumugi: Bye, then. Shuuji: Yeah, see you later. Touko: See you tomorrow～ Shuuji: ...... Touko: Oh my, what do you mean? I only made a simple observation. Shuuji: You know what you said, and you clearly did it on purpose. Touko: Mufufu. You're blushing, you know? Shuuji: I'm not used to stuff like this... Go easy on me, please. Touko: Okay, my bad. Well, it's getting late, so how about we start locking up? Shuuji: Yeah, let's. Shuuji: But, before that... Could I have a moment? Touko: Of course. There's no rush. Oh, have you decided to talk to me at last? Shuuji: It's more of a request, I guess? Touko: You need something from me? Touko: Oh, is this about your reward? Decided what you wanted, have you? Go on then, let's hear it. Touko: Please, be honest with me. How can I be of service? Shuuji: I'd just like to talk for a minute if you don't mind. Touko: You want to talk? But isn't that what we're doing right now? Or do you mean you want to talk about sex? Like pillow talk? Oh my, you naughty boy. Shuuji: Could you please cut it out with the dirty jokes? Shuuji: I don't want any kind of special conversation. Certainly not one about sex. I just want us to talk normally so I can learn more about you. Shuuji: I mean, yes, there is a reason I want to talk to you, but we don't have to talk about anything specific... A normal conversation will do just fine, really. Touko: You're really serious about this. My bad. I just went and poked fun at you like normal. Shuuji: No, it's fine. I mean, I know this is a bit out of the blue. Touko: What's this about, though? Why do you want to know more about me? Shuuji: Well, you see, errm... There's no big reason behind it. Shuuji: It's just, we're in the same club, but I barely know anything about you. When I realized that, it started to bother me and made me want to do something about it. Touko: Oh, I see. Shuuji: So I just thought we could hang out together a little, or something. Shuuji: So... is that a no, then? Touko: Chatting itself isn't a problem. I don't mind doing that. Shuuji: Oh, well, that's good... Touko: Well, chatting a little isn't much of a reward, is it? It's just a normal, everyday thing. Touko: So it doesn't feel right. Hmm... Oh, I know. Let's go somewhere on our next day off, just the two of us, and talk there. Shuuji: Huh? Just the two of us? Touko: Yeah, that's right. That'll make it nice and easy for us to talk, won't it? Shuuji: D-Do you mean like... Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Yeah, sounds great. Touko: It's settled, then! Your reward for doing a good job with the Halloween party is a date with me. I sound a bit arrogant, putting it that way. Ahaha. Shuuji: N-No, I don't think you did at all. Thank you very much, Senpai. Touko: No problem. Well then, I'm looking forward to our date. Shuuji: I-I'm looking forward to it too. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: A date with Togakushi-senpai... Shuuji: A date... A date, huh? Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Do I even have any good date clothes?! Hideaki: Yo! Shuuji: Hey. Hideaki: What're you doing here so early? Shuuji: Just thinking about things. Hideaki: If something's bothering you, why not go talk to your friends at the OC? Shuuji: If it was a normal problem, I would. Shuuji: But this is a matter of pride. I can't talk to girls about this. Hideaki: Oho. This sounds interesting―no, I dare say fascinating. Hideaki: Well, we're both men here. You can talk to me about it! Shuuji: Huh? With you? Kaidou...? Hideaki: What's with that reaction? Don't talk smack until you try! I mean, the drum thing worked out, didn't it? Shuuji: That's true. Shuuji: You're being awfully nice today. Hideaki: That's 'cause it looks like something's really bothering you. And now I wanna know what it is. Shuuji: You're really enjoying this, huh? Hideaki: Kinda? But I'm pretty worried too. I'm not gonna laugh at you, I swear. I'll just give you my opinion. Shuuji: The whole reason I'm hesitant is that I know you'll laugh at me. Hideaki: A date, huh? I see, hmm... Hideaki: ...... Hideaki: Pfft, ahahahaha! Even middle schoolers don't worry about that nowadays! Ahahahaha! Shuuji: I thought you weren't gonna laugh! Hideaki: Sorry, my bad. Couldn't help it. Just didn't expect you to be worrying about a date. Shuuji: I think a lot of people worry about dates, actually. Hideaki: I went out and bought new clothes and everything for it. But I was wearing stuff I wasn't used to, so it went horribly. Shuuji: So, do you think I should dress up properly for a date? Hideaki: I dunno. Like, obviously you have to pay attention to your looks, but... I don't think you need to dress fancy or anything. Hideaki: Especially in your case, Shuuji. It's not like you're going on an actual date, right? So the rules for a normal date don't apply. Shuuji: Yeah... You're right. "

Nene: Y-You know I can't possibly do that! Shuuji: Not doing anything when we're this close is driving me crazy. I at least need some stimulus.  Nene: And you want me to masturbate, to provide you with that...? Ah, yah, mmh, mhh... mh, ah, ah! Shuuji: Show me how you masturbate... Please. Nene: That's so embarrassing, though...! Mh, mhhh *pant*... *pant*... urgh... Shuuji: You say that, but your body is shaking. Let me guess, you're feeling even more horny now? *kiss* *kiss*... Nene: Ah, ah, ahhh! Mh, mhhh... ah, ahhh, mh... mh, aaah! Shuuji: Aren't you at the point where you need to do something about that?  Nene: Mh, mhh... *pant* *pant*... mhhh. Shuuji: You can masturbate at your own pace, I don't mind... *kiss*... Here, you can even use my member as a masturbation aid. Y'know, do the same thing you always do.  Nene: Mhhhh...! What do you mean, like I always do? I've never masturbated in a situation like this before.  Nene: Mhhh... ah *pant*... Your penis is just as hot. It's burning... mhh! Shuuji: Yeah, I'm too damn horny right now. So go ahead and start masturbating whenever, Nene. Nene: Mh, mmh... *pant* *pant*... mmh! Shuuji: They call it the corona. Try saying it, Nene. Nene: The corona? Shuuji: That's right. Nene: *pant*... *pant*... The corona. It has this kind of projecting border... but, despite how hard the shaft is, it's squishy here... Nene: Ah, I think I understand now. This is the part that always rubs me so intensely. This is what makes it feel so good.  Shuuji: Ah, nh... mhh! Shuuji: It does... But you're supposed to be masturbating now. Nene: Mhm, nh... Then I'll start.  Shuuji: You're really burning up now.  Nene: It's not my fault... Mhh, I didn't expect it to feel this good... mh, mhh, hn, aaaah...! Nene: Ah, y-yes... I'm okay... The corona just tugged on a very sensitive spot... Shuuji: Wait... By that, do you mean what I think you mean... Nene: My c-clitoris... When I'm doing this, the corona ends up tugging at it and... mhh, hyah, mh, mh, aaaah! Nene: Huh? How could I... I've never used a penis to masturbate before... mhh, ah! Shuuji: But you do like to play with your clit, no? Nene: Well, mhh, ah, hah, hah... Playing with my clitoris feels good... hah, mhh, I love it. Shuuji: Yeah, I remember you moaned the loudest when the vibrator was on your clit last time. I could tell you were really feeling good.  Nene: Ahh... Don't say that, mh, mhh, please don't say that. Mhh... You're going to make me remember that embarrassing experience... mmh! Nene: Ah, ah, ah...! What should I do, I can't stop my hips anymore... hah, hah, mhhh... my clitoris feels so good. Shuuji: That's alright. Keep masturbating with my cock.  Nene: Mh, mh, mh, ah, mmmh... Y-Yes, I will. I'll rub my clitoris with your corona... mh, mhh, mh, aaaaanh! Nene: Well... ah, ah, aaah... mh, mhh... hah, haah... haah... Shuuji: I can tell you're feeling good rubbing your clit, but that doesn't seem to be enough. So I was wondering if you did other things.  Nene: Haah, haah... Mh, mhh, haaah, ah, ah... What I'll do is stimulate my clitoris like this... then use my other fingers to finger myself... mmh! Shuuji: You can do that if you want.  Nene: But...! Mhh, I'd have to move your penis out of the way... meaning I couldn't use it to rub my clitoris... mmh! Shuuji: But you want more satisfaction out of this, no? Nene: Haah... haah... haah... aaah, mhhh...! Nene: Ah, ah, mhh! I do... I want to finger myself, I want to finger my pussy while touching my clitoris, haah, haah, haah, mmh, mhh! Nene: Hah, mh... mhh, mh, mhh... hah, hah, mh, mhh... Nene: Mh, but, if I do that... I won't be masturbating anymore. You said you wanted to see me masturbate... haah, haah. Nene: Ahh... but I want something in my pussy so bad... What should I do... ah, ah, aaah...!! Nene: Well... Dirty thoughts. Haah, haah... mhh, aaah, I think of you, the times we kissed, the times we had sex.  Shuuji: So you always masturbate to me?  Nene: Mh, mhh... Of course. I don't have my arousal fits anymore... haah, haah... I don't think I've ever once masturbated thinking of anyone or anything other than you.  Nene: Hah, haah, haah... Yes. I picture your hard, firm penis... hah, hah, hah, so ferocious yet so cute... Nene: It always feels good when you stick in in deep... I love the tip. Like how the corona part tugs on my clitoris like this... ah, ah, ah, ah, aaaaah!! Shuuji: I love your pussy just as much. It feels incredible.  Nene: Mhhh, mmmmmmh... hah, haah, haah, haah... mmh, if you say something like that... haah, haah, haah, haha... Nene: Why... Ah, haah, haah, haan, mmmh... all you're doing is making me crave it more... Why can't I...? Shuuji: I want to hear you beg for it.  Nene: Wh-What...? Mh, mmh... What I just said wasn't that?  Shuuji: Nope. It's gotta be sexier.  Nene: Urk... You're a monster... You're an actual monster... Nene: I-I need it... I need your rock-hard cock inside my pussy... Shuuji: And what do you want me to do after that?  Nene: Well... mmh... I want you to thrust... in and out, as hard as you can.  Shuuji: You're such a dirty girl, you know that?  Nene: Ahh... I'm sorry for being this way... but, aaah, I want more... I need more. I can't think anymore, I'm about to melt any second.  Nene: Please, spread my pussy wide open, and thrust it in all the way to my womb... Please, haah, haah, put it in... mhhh, fuck my pussy as hard as you can...! Shuuji: Okay, you may. Nene: Th-Thank you. Haah, haah, haah, I'm putting it inside then, right now. Shuuji: Uh, kgh... Nene, you're really tight near the entrance... It actually hurts. Nene: It's not my fault... mh, ahh, I've been wanting this so badly. I couldn't take it... Of course it's going to end up like this, ahhh... Nene: Haah, haah, ah, ahhh... I just love the sensation of it touching my womb and heating up. Shuuji: I love how tight and filthy wet your pussy is.  Nene: Thank you, ah, ah, ah, mmmh... mhhh... mh, mh, mh, mh! Nene: No, I'm doing it... You're always so rough. Haah, haah... Besides, it still feels like I'm masturbating when I'm the one moving.  Nene: So I'm going to move... You just sit there and continue watching... haah, haah, mh, mhh! Nene: Haah, haah, mh, mhh... So, are you watching me masturbate? Mh, mh, mh, mh, aaaaah... aaaaah!! Shuuji: Yeah, I am. You're the dirtiest girl alive, Nene. Nene: Mmh, aaah, you asked me to masturbate in front of you... mh, hn, hah, hah, aaaaah! Thish is shoo much!! Nene: Mh, mh, mh...! Ah, aaah, I feel good too. Your dick keeps rubbing against my womb... ah, ah, ah! Nene: They're moving completely on reflex, ah, aaaaaaah... Oh god, if you keep rubbing me there... I'm going to cum again! Shuuji: God, we're fucking like a pair of animals in heat...! Nene: No, it's not that... I can't control my body... mh, mh, mh, mh, aaaaaaaah... it's rubbing me, it feels so good. Shuuji: Why does it feel so good? Do you have any idea?  Nene: That's because, mhh, mhhhh, aaaahhh, I'm using your pe... penis, your penis to stimulate my pussy... ah, ah, ahhh. Nene: Haah, haah, I'm a mess... I'm losing myself.... aaaaah... Oh god, I can't take it, masturbating with your penis feels inshane.  Shuuji: N-Nene... you're tightening... up! Nene: Ish not my fault... mh, mh, aaaaaah, it just feels so good, haah, haah, haaaaah, aaaah... aaah, it's incredible...! Shuuji: Kgh... uh... you're burning up... Your pussy is on fire, Nene. Nene: Ahhh, aaah, mh, mhhh... It feels like I'm hogging the pleasure, but my body... ah, ah, ah! My body just, ah, aaaah!  Shuuji: Don't worry. It feels amazing for me... Nene: R-Really? Mhhh, aaaaaah... Doesh it really feel that good? Shuuji: Absolutely. I can't think straight anymore. I seriously can't live without you anymore. Nene, I love you so much.

Shuuji: Where do you want my cum, Nene?  Nene: Inside! Cum inside my pussy, please... mh, mhh... I want you to shoot it all inside me, mh, mhhh, mhhhh!! Nene: I can't stop, I can't stooop... ah, ah, ah, ahh, I love you, I love you, I love you so much! Shuuji: I love you too... Aaaaah, I'm cumming! I'm cumming!! Shuuji: Kgh, still... more. Nene: Mhh, aaaah, hah, hah, hahn... ah, hah, hah, haah... it's flowing into me, filling me up... ah. *pant* *pant* *pant* Shuuji: *pant*... *pant*... Huh? Why are you thanking me? You did all the work. Nene: I asked you to cum inside, and you did... I'm full of your semen, and that makes me a happy girl... Shuuji: Nnh!! Nene: Ah, ahh... There's still more coming out? Gosh... you're such a handful... Go on, let it all out. *pant* *pant* Shuuji: Well, maybe I'd rather not... Nene: ...Why not? Shuuji: Kghhh! Shuuji: Nene... *pant* *pant*... Nene: Why did you pull out...? *pant* *pant* *pant* Shuuji: I just screwed up. Plus, I thought pulling out could be nice for a change.  Nene: Are you being a meanie again...? Shuuji: No, no. Shuuji: Figured maybe we could go for another round. Nene: Wh-Whaat... Y-You still haven't had enough, after everything we've done...? Shuuji: Oh, I have had my fill... But the thing is, my love for you intensifies every time I cum, so I end up wanting to keep going.  Nene: Urk... That means we'll be here all day... Shuuji: True. We can just save it for another day.  Nene: Give me a few minutes... to catch my breath. We can decide whether or not to stop after that.  Shuuji: ...Okay. Nene: We were away for quite some time... I kind of feel bad for the others.  Nene: Ah, yes. I forgot; we still have to clean up. Shuuji: We do, but we have a little something to do before that― Nene: ......? Touko: Ah, there you guys are.  Meguru: Seriously. I get that you're all lovey-dovey, but choose a different day to go sneak off together. You kept us waiting. Nene: I'm sorry. We'll help with the clean-up right away.  Tsumugi: No, that's not yet. We were waiting on you for something else.   Nene: I that so? Then what is this something else...? Touko: Well, then... *cough* Ayachi-san, thank you for all your hard work with organizing the party. We truly thank you. Nene: Huh? Ah... yes, thank you for your hard work as well. Touko: But part of me is glad I left everything to you and the rest of the club. I can't tell you how amazing you were up there on stage.  Nene: Thank... you. Touko: Then you also helped us out when we were left with no candidate for the Student Council elections... Really, you've been far too kind to me.  Touko: You're the reason I was able to see my term to completion with no regrets.  Nene: O-Oh no, I really haven't done anything special at all. Touko: Oh, but you have. Hasn't she, Koshiji-san? Koshiji: Quite. Togakushi-senpai is exactly right.  Koshiji: Plus, your singing was simply wonderful. It really fired everyone up. They loved every second of it.  Koshiji: The party would have never reached those levels of excitement had it not been for you. I mean it.  Koshiji: Also, the OC helped me with a more personal issue of mine... It had been eating at me for years, but thanks to you all, I was finally able to move on...  Nene: Th-Thank you... so much. Wakana: Yeah, she's totally right! The performance was such a huge success all because of you! Wakana: Having someone as good as you up there with me made me feel so much better. I could just focus on playing my guitar.  Nene: If you thought so, then I'm glad I helped you.  Wakana: Oh, don't be so humble! You're a lifesaver, I swear. This was my VERY FIRST live performance, and oh my god! Wakana: It felt absolutely EXHILARATING! Really, thank you so, so, so much! Nene: Thank you so much... Seriously.  Hideaki: I oughta thank you too. I might swing by the OC some time for a problem I've been having... Nene: Ah, yes. You're welcome anytime. Though, I can't guarantee we'll be able to assist you until we actual know what your problem is... Meguru: No worries, the OC can handle anything! I say that as someone who was helped by them myself.  Meguru: And I know Kawakami-kun is super thankful, too. The first date was a failure, but he told me things got better in no time.  Meguru: They went on their second date after midterms were over with, apparently.  Meguru: Since they already discussed their likes and all that last time, they knew what to do, and it turned out to be a blast. He told me to say thank you.  Nene: Oh, really? That's lovely news.  Meguru: You said it. I saw them at the party earlier, too. They were flirting away nonstop, just like a pair of lovebirds.  Meguru: Also... I think I personally owe you guys a thank you, too.  Tsumugi: Me, too. Thank you, Ayachi-san.  Meguru: I would've had to spend my three years here all sad and lonely had I not met you.  Tsumugi: And you're a big reason why I was able to make friends with everyone in class.  Nene: ...... Tsumugi: Yeah. Then you gotta go and start gazing into each other's eyes.  Nene: Ah, sorry. I didn't mean to ignore you... Meguru: Well, I'll say it again. I'm very, very thankful to you, Nene-senpai. From the bottom of my heart.  Tsumugi: Me too. Thank you so much, for everything.  Touko: Oh, and don't think we're the only ones who feel this way. Every single person who came, and consulted you―they're all beyond thankful.  Touko: This party was an absolute blast, both for us, and for everyone else who attended. And that's all because of you.  Shuuji: I also wanted to say a few words to express my appreciation for you, Nene. Shuuji: I was able to change and become a better person from meeting you. And, not only that: I was able to find my soulmate.  Shuuji: You really are incredible, Nene. Nobody else could earn the gratitude of such a large amount of people.  Nene: ...... Nene: I don't think I'm particularly lacking in self-confidence... Shuuji: I know how afraid you are of failing.  Nene: Well... Shuuji: We have no way of knowing what route will lead to the best possible future. We simply don't. Shuuji: Yet you have all these people saying you made a difference in their lives. The way I see it, that's already incredible enough.  Shuuji: So, don't be afraid. Have more confidence in yourself, Nene. You're amazing.  Nene: ...... "

Tsumugi: Okay. Schoolboy B: That's what Hisashima-sensei said, so it must be true. Schoolgirl C: Yeah, right. I mean, she definitely has breasts. Schoolboy B: Then why is she wearing a boy's uniform? Schoolgirl A: Who cares? She's so small and cute♪ Kanae: Come on. Class is starting soon. Tsumugi: Phew... This is exhausting... Tsumugi: Ah, yeah. Thanks, Ayachi-san.

Nene: We have P.E. next. Let's go and get changed. Tsumugi: Right. Wait, where were the locker rooms, again? Nene: Oh, I'm sorry. They completely slipped my mind when showing you around yesterday. Tsumugi: That's okay. Don't worry about it. But ugh, P.E... Nene: Are you not good at P.E.? Tsumugi: I'm okay at physical activity. Tsumugi: But I'll be the only girl in a boy's gym uniform... I'm sure I'll stand out again. The thought is kind of depressing. Nene: Oh, I see... And we take P.E. with another class. The girls from there might get curious. Tsumugi: But it's not like I can just skip it... Let's go. Shuuji: Yeah, I'm leaving soon. But before that... Shuuji: Kariya, you got a moment? Wakana: Huh? What's up? I was about to leave for the locker room. Shuuji: I have a favor to ask regarding P.E. Wakana: What kind of favor could you be asking, considering we have P.E. separate? You better not be asking for anything dirty! Hideaki: Oh, let me in on the fun. Shuuji: Sorry, but this is serious. It's about Shiiba-san. Wakana: Huh? What about her? Shuuji: Well, she just transfered in, and the way she dresses is unusual. Shuuji: So I'm wondering if I could ask you to lend her a hand if anything happens. Hideaki: Interesting... I didn't think you'd be that concerned about her. Wakana: Could it be... love at first sight? You have a crush on her, don'tcha? Shuuji: No, this is a club matter. Hisashima-sensei asked us to look after her due to her special circumstances. Wakana: Kanae-chan? She asked the OC? Hideaki: Now that you mention it, Ayachi-san did just approach her. I thought it was odd... I guess this explains it. Shuuji: Ayachi-san is also watching out for her, but I thought it could be hard for her to do on her own. Shuuji: But I can't exactly help her during P.E... Sorry, but could you help us out here? Wakana: Will you treat me to something? Shuuji: ...How about a slice of cake sometime? Wakana: Make it two slices. Shuuji: Deal. Thanks. I'm counting on you. Wakana: Yeah. Though, I doubt I'll have much to do since Ayachi-san is already watching out for her. Shuuji: Yeah, okay. Hideaki: I have to say, though, you're taking your club pretty seriously. Shuuji: Yeah, I guess. May as well go all out with it since I went through the trouble of joining. Hideaki: That's a good mindset. Though, I guess just like you. Hideaki: Oh, right. Since you're such a good student, I bet you did your math homework, right? Can you let me copy it later? Shuuji: You should really do it yourself. Hideaki: I know. I will next time. Please. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Don't copy it word-for-word, okay? Hideaki: Gotcha! Thanks, man! Shuuji: Huh? Uh-oh... Hideaki: What's wrong? Shuuji: My math notebook's gone... I haven't seen it all morning, actually. I definitely did my homework, though. Hideaki: Maybe you forgot it at home? Shuuji: No, I didn't even take it out at home... Oh, right! I did my homework in the clubroom. That's gotta be where the notebook is. "

Shuuji: Besides, considering the Student Council's responsibilities, you wouldn't want someone who's only in it for the perks. Nene: Ideally, yes, you wouldn't. After all, there is no second try if it doesn't work out. Meguru: Well, yeah, I guess so... Tsumugi: Then... Meguru: ...Hrrmm. Yeah, just telling people to become the next president ain't gonna work, is it? Nene: I suppose all we can do for now is postpone the candidate announcement date in order to give ourselves more time to think. Tsumugi: And we could use that time to advertise the election more actively in order to up awareness. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: I'll be back soon. Shuuji: ...It's not like I have anything to lose by talking to her. Shuuji: Koshiji-san. Koshiji: Hm? Hoshina-kun? Koshiji: Long time no see. What brings you here? Aren't you in another class? Shuuji: Yeah, class A. Do you have a moment? There's something I want to ask you. Koshiji: You want to ask me something? Okay... What is it? Shuuji: Sorry, could we go somewhere else for that? Koshiji: So, what's up? What's all this about? You even led me out of the classroom. Koshiji: Oh, heh, don't bother asking me out. I'm not interested, so you'd only put me in an awkward place. Shuuji: Oh, don't worry. I wasn't gonna. Koshiji: You know, it's pretty irritating when you say that like it's nothing. Koshiji: Huh? What do you mean? Why would you be asking me about that? Shuuji: Could you please tell me why you're not participating in the presidential election? Koshiji: ...Why? I don't think that has anything to do with you. Shuuji: You see, I'm actually in the Occult Club. Koshiji: The Occult Club...? Isn't that the club Ayachi-san is in? The one that helps students with their problems? Shuuji: Yeah. Yesterday, Togakushi-senpai asked for our help because there are no candidates for the next election. Koshiji: The President came to you... Hmm... Koshiji: So she's having you convince me to run? Shuuji: No, not quite. She actually asked us to look for another candidate. Shuuji: She said she didn't want to force anyone. Koshiji: Hmm... Then why have you come to me? Shuuji: The situation isn't looking good. Shuuji: So I figured that if we helped solve that problem for you, you could run. Koshiji: ...... Koshiji: It's not like I have much of a reason... I'm simply fed up with all the work. That's all. Shuuji: Even though I've heard that you take your work really seriously? You even stay late a lot, right? Koshiji: Well, yeah... But aren't you jumping the gun a little by assuming I have a reason? Shuuji: Well, I saw you talking with Togakushi-senpai about the election. You looked really torn up about not running. Shuuji: So I figured there must be a reason for that. Koshiji: ...You've changed, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: ...? Koshiji: Well, you were never one to butt into other people's affairs before. Koshiji: Even when people were clearly lying to you, you'd just pretend you didn't notice and still fill in for them, right? Shuuji: Well... A lot has happened lately. Shuuji: So, anyway, what do you say? Do you want to talk to this new me about whatever's plaguing you? Koshiji: No. There is nothing to talk about in the first place. But even if there was... there's no way I could. Shuuji: No matter what? Koshiji: Just stop it. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: *sigh* If that's what you want. Koshiji: Was that all? Can I return to my class now? Shuuji: Yeah. Thanks. Sorry I took up your time. Koshiji: ...... Koshiji: Whatever, it's okay. Kanae: What was that? A fight with your girlfriend? Shuuji: Yeah, as if. Wait, where the heck did you come from? Kanae: Ah, of course. I doubt you even have friends in other classes, so a girlfriend? Hah, not happening. Shuuji: I'm gonna cry if you keep bullying me like this. I'll cry like a little baby and drive you into a corner. Kanae: Stop being so vindictive! Kanae: Anyway, what was that about? It looked like a fight to me, at least. Shuuji: It really wasn't. It was just some club business. Kanae: Who are you helping out this time? Shuuji: Information on our clientele is strictly confidential. Oh, but I guess this is a pretty serious school-related matter this time. Shuuji: It's the Student Council president. Kanae: Oh, about how there are no candidates for president. You must've been asking Koshiji-san about why she won't run. Shuuji: Do you know anything about her? Kanae: Not about this, sorry. That girl won't tell anyone why she isn't running. Shuuji: Oh... Shuuji: Well, let me ask this instead; what's her work ethic and attitude been like in the Student Council? Kanae: Hm? Well... I'm not involved in the Student Council, but it always seemed to me like she enjoys her work there. Kanae: We teachers made the same mistake, thinking she'd run for sure. The faculty room is in chaos. Kanae: Oh, right. Different topic, but could I ask you to thank Ayachi-san for me? Shuuji: I don't mind, but what for? Kanae: About Shiiba-san. I talked to her a little this morning, and she seemed pretty grateful too. Shuuji: Glad to hear. Kanae: These days, there are some issues teachers aren't well equipped to help with no matter how attentive we are. I'm thankful to all of you. Shuuji: I feel like she would have done fine one way or another even if we hadn't stepped in, though. Kanae: Yeah, probably. But when you're responsible for other people, you can't just stop worrying about them. Kanae: So anyway, let Ayachi know that I'm really grateful to her. Shuuji: Okay, got it. Kanae: Thanks.

Teacher A: Hisashima-sensei, how are things going for that transfer student? Kanae: She's doing great. There aren't any problems so far. Teacher A: I see. I'm glad to hear that.

Teacher A: Yeah, I suppose so. Alright, time to go to my next class. Nene: It's weak, but the bottle is responding. It should be possible to retrieve fragments from her. Shuuji: Oh, nice.

Tsumugi: Oh, I see... Shuuji: I feel like this is because everyone already knows, not because they don't care. Shuuji: A positive way to look at this would be that the advertising succeeded in spreading the word to everyone. But... Tsumugi: That doesn't do any good if no one actually wants to run for president. Shuuji: Right. I doubt this kind of simple advertising will get us any further. Shuuji: Yeah, if only that was so easy... Touko: Maybe people would look at the fliers more if we made them pink? Especially the guys. Shuuji: Togakushi-senpai... Touko: Sorry, sorry. But jokes aside, we can stop handing out fliers now. Tsumugi: Are you sure? Touko: I think just about everyone knows about the election by now, so handing out more fliers would be pretty meaningless. Touko: Besides, even if I'm retiring, I'm still the president for now and have lots of other things to do. So it's not like I'm going easy on you guys. Nene: Then... Touko: I'll wait and see how effective our advertising was and then take things from there myself. Meguru: Do you know of any good candidates other than that Koshiji-san person? Touko: I dunno... The other vice president is better suited for drafting reports, so if I was gonna persuade someone, it would probably be the secretary. Touko: Anywho, that's just another part of my job, so leave it all to me. Nene: ...Okay, we will. But please don't hesitate to let us know if there's anything else we can help with. Touko: Thank you, Ayachi-san. Nene: I'm very sorry we couldn't be of help. Touko: That's not true. Thanks to you, the rest of the council was able to keep working while we were out here spreading the word. Nene: Just let us know if there's anything else we can help with. We'll gladly do whatever we can. Touko: Okay, thank you. I'll take you up on that if we ever need the help. Touko: Alright then, let's call it a day. Tsumugi: But we already tried to come up with something during lunch break and couldn't. Meguru: Right... *sigh* Shuuji: Anyway, shouldn't we go somewhere else now? No point in standing around and talking here. Nene: We should call it a day. The sun's starting to set, after all. Meguru: Nene-senpai, can we go home together? Nene: Sorry, but I can't. There's something I need to do today. Meguru: Oh, really? That's too bad. Meguru: How about you, Shiiba-senpai? Got any plans? Tsumugi: Me? No, I don't. I was going to go straight home... You really want to walk home with me? Meguru: Of course! If you don't mind, I'd love to! Tsumugi: Of course I don't! I really want to as well. Meguru: Yay! Tsumugi: Ehehe. Meguru: Ah, what about you, Hoshina-senpai? Shuuji: Thanks for asking, but sorry. I got other plans. Meguru: Well, okay... Well, let's go, Shiiba-senpai. Where do you live? Tsumugi: Past the station. Meguru: Same as me, then! Umm... Would it be okay for me to call you Tsumugi-senpai? Tsumugi: Y-Yeah! Of course! "

            "Tsumugi: It's about you-know-what. Shuuji: Got it. Nene: Would it be okay for us to skip club today and go visit Togakushi-senpai? Shuuji: Well, that would be just fine. Have you figured something out? Nene: Now, she's not too confident about this, since she doesn't know if it will work or not... but Nanao wants to try something. Shuuji: What is it?! Nene: It's related to how Shiiba-san and I collect fragments. You know how we use our magic to convert people's emotions into fragments we can collect, right? Tsumugi: The gist of it is that we can use our magic weapons to interfere with a person's heart by injecting it with magic. Shuuji: So, you have a spell that can help her wake up? Nene: Not quite. Due to the way the seal is actively maintained, it is probably too difficult to cancel it as a third party. Tsumugi: We're not going to use a spell. We'll hit her with a direct concentration of magic. Nene: That should be strong enough to interfere with the magic seal, cause it to malfunction, and then break down completely. Shuuji: Break down...? Will Touko-san be okay? Nene: Souma-san said she probably will be. Nene: Getting hit by concentrated magic can be rather traumatic, but it should have no long-lasting or severe effects on Senpai. Shuuji: I see... Shuuji: But how are you gonna get that concentrated magic? Tsumugi: We've decided to take it from what we've gathered so far. Shuuji: Huh?! You can't do that! Nene: It's fine. We owe a lot to you two. Tsumugi: Yeah. Besides, this current situation makes me sad too. Tsumugi: The OC just isn't the same without everyone there. Nene: That's right. At this rate, we'll be too worried to help anyone who comes for a consultation. Tsumugi: So there you have it. Nene: You're not the only one worried about Togakushi-senpai, you know? Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Yeah... Thank you. Nene: Please don't mention it. Tsumugi: Yeah! And, um... I hate to say it, but... we still don't know if this will work or not. Shuuji: Even so, I'm so grateful to you guys. Nene: What did I just say? You're not the only one worried. We don't need your thanks. Tsumugi: Yeah, totally. We'll talk more about this after school. Shuuji: Yeah, thanks. Shuuji: That's fine by me, but... Meguru: ...? But what? Meguru: You're not going to tell me that I'm not allowed to go, are you? I'm worried too. The least you could let me do is say hello. Shuuji: No, I wasn't going to say that. Shuuji: Got it. I really appreciate her coming with us. Tsumugi: Okay. Let's go before it gets too late. Meguru: Here we are! Tsumugi: Togakushi-senpai... Oh, she's sleeping. Meguru: Then let's try not to make too much noise. Meguru: We should do something with these flowers first. Is there a vase here? Tsumugi: Dunno. She's just a student living on her own, so maybe not. Meguru: Oh, we mighta screwed up... What should we do? Shuuji: There are some empty bottles over there that might do the job. Meguru: Oh, okay. I'll wash one out and use it. Meguru: What about the sponge? We should probably use a different one from the dish sponge. I don't want to get that one dirty. Shuuji: We have new ones. I'll just buy more if we run out. Meguru: You sound like you're used to this. Shuuji: Well, you know... Meguru: Yeah, leave it to me. Shuuji: Great, thanks. Nene: How does her situation look, Nanao? Nanao: I don't see any change. There's no telling when she'll recover if we leave her on her own... Nanao: I think we should give it a go. By interfering, we may at least create an opportunity for something to change. Shuuji: ...Very well. Nene: Okay then. Let's try it. Tsumugi: We have to do something about Meguru-chan first. Shuuji: Yeah. Meguru: This should be good. Yeah, nice and clean. They don't really smell, but I better put them on this table so they're outta the way. Meguru: Looking good. That just leaves the shawl we bought. It's starting to get cold out, so it should come in handy. Meguru: I'll give it to you before I forget, Hoshina-senpai. Please give it to Togakushi-senpai when she wakes up. Shuuji: Alright. I'll be sure to tell her these are get-well gifts from you all. Shuuji: Sorry to ask you this, but could you do some shopping for us? We need milk and some kind of fruit. Meguru: Huh? Why didn't you buy that on the way here? Shuuji: I totally forgot, sorry. Would you mind doing this me, please? Meguru: *sigh* Ya big moron. Fine. Where's the local supermarket? Shuuji: You'll find one after heading west from here for about five minutes. Meguru: Roger that. So, which way's west? Shuuji: Leave the building, and go in the direction of the hand you hold your chopsticks in. Meguru: Look, I know the difference between right and left! Nanao: That's plenty. If you two could activate your witch forms. Nene, Tsumugi: Certainly. Nene: So then, what exactly do we have to do? Tsumugi: You still haven't told us what it is we'll be doing. Nanao: Nothing out of the ordinary. Just do as you always do. Nanao: However, Nene, use this bullet. Nanao: Our preparations are complete. Now Shiiba-san should be able to pour her magic into this girl as well. Nene: And I just have to shoot this magic bullet at her? Nanao: Correct. I've enchanted your magic weapons to do the reverse of what they usually do during collection. What's most important are the emotions you two feel as you send your magic. Nene: Our emotions? Tsumugi: What do you mean? Nanao: I need you to put everything you feel for her into the magic you're hitting her with. Nanao: Those emotions will become a voice, which should help in calling out to her conscious self and waking her up. Nene: ...Understood. Tsumugi: But... Wouldn't it be more effective to use Hoshina-kun's emotions? Nanao: That would be preferable, but he can't use magic weapons. I'll try to think of a way for him to help, just in case... but I can't think of anything right now. Nanao: We're leaving this in your hands. Tsumugi: R-Right. Nene: Okay, let's do this at the exact same time. Tsumugi: Yeah. Tsumugi: So please, wake up and come back to us. Let's all go back to the clubroom together. Nene: We've been waiting for you. So... Tsumugi: It's too lonely without you. So... Nene, Tsumugi: Togakushi-senpai. "

Tsumugi: Closer, but still not close enough. Shuuji: I guess neither of us fit, then. Nene: Yes. Tsumugi: Oh right, has there been any progress with the OC― Nene: Sorry, but we'll have to leave that for later. Tsumugi: ...Right. Nene: ...... Tsumugi: ...... Nene: It's been reserved for us today. Come in. Tsumugi: O-Okay. Tsumugi: Hello, Souma-san... Huh? Tsumugi: Huh... I thought we were coming here to... see her? Tsumugi: ...What? Umm, Ayachi-san? Nene: Bird alps have the freedom to live in the sky. Nene: Many of them choose to keep constant watch over their witch. Were you unaware of this? Tsumugi: N-Now that you mention it, she does seem to show up at the most convenient of times. Tsumugi: But what of it? You're acting strange today, Ayachi-san. Nene: I'm sorry. I know I am. Nene: But, do you think I might ask you for a rather brazen favor? Tsumugi: Sure. What do you need...? Nene: Are you not just pretending to be afraid? Tsumugi: Fweh? Tsumugi: Akagi?! Akagi: Tsumugi, I'm here to save you! Tsumugi: Watch out! Akagi: What? Nngh?! Nanao: ...But on the ground, cats are your natural predators. Akagi: Nanaooo! What the hell are you up to?! Tsumugi: Y-Yes, what's gotten into the two of you? Tsumugi: Did you call me here just to lure out Akagi? Nene: I'm sorry. I know this has nothing to do with you, Shiiba-san. Nene: But something's happened that I cannot forgive. Tsumugi: What? Akagi, have you done something? Akagi: No! I don't recall doing anything! Nanao: Does the name Atsuma Sayako ring any bells? Akagi: You know this person, Tsumugi? Well, I don't! Who is she? Nanao: Playing the fool? Or do you truly not remember? Nanao: Perhaps you don't bother the learning the names of everyone you attack. Tsumugi: ...She attacked her? Akagi: I haven't attacked anyone! Wh-What are you talking about?! Nene: Atsuma-san's heart should have been on the road to recovery. Nene: And yet she seems to have lost all motivation recently. Nene: It is as if she has given up on everything. Nene: No, Shiiba-san. As I said, what you did had her on the road to recovery. Nene: So I took it upon myself to do a bit of investigating. Nene: And I discovered scars on her heart, proving that it had been forcibly weakened! Akagi: Wh―?! Nanao: To have a hole open in one's heart, it must be brittle in the first place. Nanao: But the only ones capable of forcing one open are witches and alps. Tsumugi: P-Please, wait! That doesn't mean Akagi did it! Nene: Shiiba-san, have you forgotten her past transgressions? Akagi forcibly weakened Hoshina-kun's heart and opened a hole in it. Tsumugi: W-Well... Nene: ...So kind-hearted that they are easy to wound. Nene: I could never forgive someone for purposely targeting those kinds of people. Tsumugi: Ayachi-san... Nanao: I'm sorry, Shiiba-san. But there'd be no chasing her if she were to take flight. Nanao: This area falls under my territory, and I have a duty to protect it. Akagi: Gah, even so... Does that give you the right to do as you please?! Nanao: I should be asking you the same thing. Nanao: Of course, I will give you a chance to defend yourself. Nanao: However, our investigations have also discovered that your progress towards becoming human has vastly accelerated as of late. Nanao: I doubt you will be able to explain that so easily. Tsumugi: Ah, ahh... Well, errm... Nene: Shiiba-san, do you know anything? Tsumugi: U-Um, I'm sorry! Nene: Hm? Yes, I remember you saying that's the name you gave the teddy bear. Tsumugi: No, that's not what I mean. I really should have explained this sooner. Tsumugi: He tried to take on some of my debt and ended up like this. Tsumugi: ...This is really Hoshina Shuuji-kun. Nene: What do you mean by that? Shuuji: Yeah, um... I'm really sorry. Shuuji: In exchange, I'm only allowed to be human for those same few hours. Outside of that time, I return to this form. Nene: Wait, you mean the debt from her contract? That can turn someone into a teddy bear? Nanao: It could never happen with a normal contract. Is this really Hoshina-kun? Shuuji: Yes, though I'm not sure how I'm meant to prove it. Nanao: No, I'll believe you. You really have done something stupid. Nanao: I hope both you and Akagi have learned that nothing good can come of disregarding the rules to form an irregular contract. Akagi: H-Humph! This at least proves my innocence! Nanao: I don't know. That doesn't prove... Hm? You... Nanao: I have a duty to investigate any incidents that occur in my territory. Nanao: I'm sorry, but this has not changed the fact that you are the most likely suspect at the current point in time. Nanao: And it'd be especially bad if this is happening because I let you off the hook last time. Akagi: H-How dare you?! I've been saying from the start that I didn't do it! Tsumugi: A-Akagi, calm down. Akagi: But... I didn't do it! Akagi: If I say I didn't do it, then I didn't do it! Nanao: We have no other suspects. At least, not at the present. Tsumugi: U-Umm, I don't think Akagi did it. Shuuji: Sorry, but neither do I. Shuuji: Like, she might be stupid, but she's not a bad person. Nanao: Heh, I know that. But that still doesn't prove her innocence. Nanao: The only alp who has changed territories recently is Akagi. Nanao: And moreover, she specifically chose to encroach on mine. Tsumugi: But... Nanao: And can you really trust an alp who would make your boyfriend pay such an enormous price? Tsumugi: I believe her... Akagi may have done some horrible things, and she may have been deceptive... Tsumugi: But she never truly lies. Tsumugi: She would never insist that she hadn't done something if it wasn't the truth! Nanao: You have a point. She isn't that cunning. Nanao: If she were then, circumstances aside... Shuuji: Souma-san? Nanao: Is it not possible that with Akagi's progress towards becoming human, she has gained additional wisdom? Nanao: It may seem obvious that there's another culprit, but we have to consider all possibilities. Tsumugi: Well, yeah, that's possible. Nanao: It wouldn't be good if more victims appeared. Nene: I planned to do as much. Nene: I apologize for getting the two of you involved as well. Tsumugi: No, don't. You haven't done anything wrong. Nene: I don't think that I'll be able to show up at the club for a while. "

Shuuji: Well, we don't know who else will participate, so there's no need to rush a decision. Tsumugi: Right. I'll think about it later at the party. Touko: Alright! Let's get started! Are you ready, everyone? Meguru: Oh, you bet! I'm raring to go. Nene: Same here. Tsumugi: Alright, then let's― Meguru: Huh? Is that someone's phone ringing? Shuuji: Oh, it's mine. Meguru: Geez! Right when Togakushi-senpai was firing us up. Shuuji: Yeah, sorry. Shuuji: Hello? Hideaki: \"Hey, Shuuji, we've got a problem! Our show's in deep shit!\" Wakana: Sorry... I caught a cold. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: %130;Are you serious?! Wakana: I'm so sorry... *cough* Shuuji: D-Don't apologize... It's not your fault. Shouldn't you be resting at home, though? Wakana: It's okay. I don't have a fever, and my cough is gone. I think the cold has already passed... *cough* Shuuji: You just coughed, though. Twice. Wakana: But not because I'm sick. My throat is just a little sore still, is all. The cold itself is gone. Wakana: I can play my guitar no problem! *cough* Wakana: Told you. Shuuji: Well, the thing is... Hideaki: Even if we were to trust you and let you play... we just lost our vocalist. Wakana: Yeah, but... Shuuji: Please. I already have my hands full with the bass. There's no way I could sing on top of that. That'd end poorly, for sure. Wakana: Then what about you, Kaidou? Hideaki: I doubt I can, either. Drumming and singing at the same time wouldn't go well. I've never even tried doing that before. Hideaki: In the worst case, I'd screw up both parts. And I'd lose my drumming intensity if I had to focus on the mic. Shuuji: Besides, the song is intended for a female vocalist. Wakana: Then there's nothing we can do... Hideaki: If there is, then I sure don't know... Wakana: Right... Wakana: After all this effort... I just go and waste it all. You even told me to watch my health... Shuuji: Kariya... Hideaki: Hey now, we can still play without the vocals. We can make it work somehow! Shuuji: Yeah, this doesn't mean we can't play on stage anymore. Wakana: But we won't be able to get the crowd as excited without vocals, right? Hideaki: Yeah, I can't deny that. Shuuji: Dude. Hideaki: Oh, err, sorry! It's not your fault! Wakana: ...... Hideaki: And what are you going to do? Shuuji: I'll try and find us a vocalist. Hideaki: Are you serious...? Shuuji: It's not like we wrote our own song for this. There are others who might know the lyrics. Shuuji: We won't have time to rehearse, so we'll just have to wing it. Hideaki: I guess we gotta... At least it'll be better than any of us singing. Shuuji: You okay with that too, Kariya? Wakana: Yeah! I'm more than okay with it! I'll help too! *cough* *cough*! Hideaki: Okay, calm down. You'll make your throat even sorer. Wakana: O-Okay... Shuuji: Anyway, leave the search for a singer to me. Hideaki: Do you have someone in mind? Hideaki: No, my bad... Of course you wouldn't. Sorry for putting you on the spot.  Shuuji: You could have at least waited for my reply. Shuuji: Though, you're not wrong... Wakana: What's your plan? Shuuji: For now, I'll try talking to the girls in the OC. Shuuji: If things go well, I might get one of them to fill in. Shuuji: So yeah, could you help us out? Meguru: Th-There's no way I could sing in front of such a big crowd! Tsumugi: S-Singing? That's a tall order... Shuuji: You can't do it? Tsumugi: No way! I really want to help you out, but umm... I can't sing. I would only make things worse for you. Shuuji: It's just a school party, so it's not a big deal if you're a little off key. I mean, I may have practiced a lot, but I'm still a total newbie, myself. Tsumugi: I wouldn't be just \"a little off key\"! I'm a terrible singer... There is no way I can sing in front of a crowd! Absolutely not! I'm sorry! Shuuji: Okay... That's fine. I know I'm making a pretty unreasonable request here. Shuuji: What about you, Togakushi-senpai? Touko: Me? Shuuji: You're used to being in front of a crowd, right? Touko: I've spoken publicly plenty of times, yeah... Though, to be honest, I don't know that song. I'm not sure I've ever heard it before... Sorry. Shuuji: I see. Nene: ...Huh? Um, yes? Shuuji: Do you know the song we're planning on playing? Nene: Technically, yes. Shuuji: Then, would you help us out? Nene: And by that, you mean... you want me to sing? Shuuji: Right. Nene: But I've only really heard the song a few times, so I don't remember the lyrics very well. So I don't know... I doubt I'd be able to sing it very well. Nene: Besides, because of my, you know, I might just end up making things worse for you. Shuuji: Right... I understand that. Nene: ...... Nene: But if you really need my help, then I'll do it. Shuuji: Huh? Nene: If you don't mind, then I would love to help. Touko: Here, I made this pumpkin pudding myself. Help yourself. Koshiji: Thank you, Senpai. Koshiji: ...... Koshiji: Togakushi-senpai's very own pumpkin pudding... Shuuji: Koshiji-san... You still haven't gotten over her? Koshiji: Hm? No, you're misunderstanding. The only reason I can still talk to her is because I gave up on her. Koshiji: But, well, throwing away all my feelings for her will take a little time. Shuuji: Oh, well, keep it up. Koshiji: Oh, yeah, I will. You really don't need to worry about me. Just enjoy the party. Koshiji: You're going to play something on stage, right? I can't wait. Shuuji: You're really laying the pressure on thick; just like everyone else. Koshiji: Hahaha. Anyway, I'm looking forward to it. Meguru: What are you talking about? Shuuji: Oh, nothing. Meguru: Yeah? Meguru: Wow, though... This place is packed. Is this party more popular than we thought? Shuuji: Maybe. It's student-organized, so it's pretty chill and informal. And the costume aspect is pretty fun. Shuuji: And there's also... \"that,\" don't you think? Meguru: \"That\"? Touko: Come, everyone, and enjoy some cookies. They turned out great! Meguru: Ahh... That's what you mean. Shuuji: ...... Meguru: And don't forget about Nene-senpai. Meguru: But even still, there are a lot of girls here too. Shuuji: Yeah, I'm surprised. I guess they just wanted to cut loose after the midterms? And the third-years probably want to take their minds off studying. Shuuji: And maybe some of them are just trying to impress their crushes? Shuuji: Like with field trips, a school party could be a good chance to get a lot closer to your special someone. Meguru: Oh yeah. For sure. Shuuji: Especially this party, where you can wear a sexy costume. Schoolgirl A: But it looks great on you. You look cute. Akita: You think? Teehee, thanks! Shuuji: I'm too focused on the band performance. What about you? Meguru: I haven't cast mine yet, either. Nene-senpai and Togakushi-senpai seem really popular, though. Shuuji: Yeah, that's not too surprising. Togakushi-senpai in that costume was bound to be popular. Shuuji: Where's our other top candidate? Meguru: Nene-senpai is over there, in the corner where everyone's stuff was put. Meguru: She's learning the song by listening to both your version and the original song. Nene: I said I'd do this in the heat of the moment, but now I'm getting really scared. Why did I ever agree to this...? Nene: If I have a fit here... everyone will see me like that, just like before... Aaaaahhh... Tsumugi: Calm down, Ayachi-san! Here, I got you a drink. Nene: Thank you, Shiiba-san... I should've said no I should've said no I should've said no I should've said no I should've said no I should've said no! Shuuji: Sh-She's pretty nervous, huh? Hideaki: Hey, Shuuji! It's almost time for our performance. Shuuji: Coming! Well then, Inaba-san, I'll leave things to you. Meguru: Sure thing. I'm SO looking forward to the song, Senpai. Shuuji: You're doing that on purpose, aren't you? Meguru: Huh? You noticed? Shuuji: Good lord... I'll do what I can. Wakana: I'm fine, other than my sore throat. Hideaki: I feel fine too, of course. So, let's go pick up our star vocalist and get on stage. Shuuji: That star vocalist seems to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Hideaki: Hey, we can't replace her now. We don't have the time to look for someone else. Wakana: And besides, there are already rumors about Ayachi-san singing on stage. Shuuji: ...We might end up with a riot on our hands if we screw this up. Hideaki: Nothing we can do if she really won't do it, but I'd like to see her try, if at all possible. Shuuji: Hrmm... Shuuji: Ayachi-san, are you okay? Think you can go on stage? Nene: M-Maybe not. I feel like I'm gonna have a heart attack... Shuuji: (...Umm, I'm not just talking about your nerves. Any sign of you getting a fit?) Nene: (D-Don't remind me of that!) Shuuji: (S-Sorry!) Nene: (I don't know if it's because I'm nervous or what, but there's no problem at the moment. I just don't have the mental capacity to think about that...) Nene: A-Anyway, I'll do it. It would cause a lot of trouble if I ran away now. Though, I suppose I'll still cause trouble just by appearing on stage. Shuuji: ...... Nene: Hoshina-kun? Shuuji: It's alright, Ayachi-san. If anyone's causing trouble up there tonight, it's me. Hideaki: Exactly. There is no need for you to feel that nervous. Just think about it. Hideaki: Suddenly forming a band and performing on stage with hardly any practice or preparation was ridiculous from the start. We were bound to screw up somehow. Hideaki: And yeah, it was Shuuji who dragged us on stage in these conditions. Shuuji: ...It was you who wanted to form a band, you know. Hideaki: Oh, really? Shuuji: I mean, I never even touched a bass guitar before last week. Telling me to learn the bass in that timespan was just a wee bit unreasonable, don't you think? Wakana: True. That's pretty crazy. Nene: I don't know much about music, but even I realize that was unreasonable. Hideaki: H-Huh? Wait, am I the bad guy here? Shuuji: No, I'm sharing responsibility as well. So yeah, it's all the two of us who are to blame. Shuuji: Even if we screw up and get laughed at, you two won't be to blame. You can just laugh at us together with the audience. Wakana: Ahh... Yeah, this really isn't the time to worry about myself. Wakana: It's you, our total newbie of a bassist, who I should be worrying about instead. Nene: That... may be true. I only have to sing. Compared to Hoshina-kun's job, that's easy. Shuuji: ...Could you please stop laying the pressure on me? Hideaki: Don't worry about it. You suck, anyway. Shuuji: Look, I know that's true, but it still pisses me off to hear you say it. Shuuji: All you need to do is sing enthusiastically. That's all. Nene: I-I'll do my best. Tsumugi: Hey guys! You need to get started soon, since the costume contest winner announcement is waiting for you to finish. Nene: O-Okay. Shuuji: Let's go, then. Hideaki: Here we go, guys! Let's just have fun out there! As long as we're having fun, so will the audience. I'm speaking from experience, here. Wakana: Alright, let's do this! Hideaki: Oh man, it's been a while! Touko: Next up, we have a band performance. Are you ready? Touko: Go ahead and get started. "

Wakana: Oh my god, I LITERALLY just told you that empty apologies are the worst thing you can do! Shuuji: Alright, alright, don't fight, guys. I appreciate that you're fighting over me, but that would cause a few problems for me.  Hideaki: Then just make up with her already and we won't have a reason to fight.  Wakana: Yeah. Get things back to normal between you two. You've only been going out for a week or two, so you're wasting precious time. Hideaki: Every second spent fighting is a second not spent French-kissing. Time is precious. You're not gonna be able to spend this much time together all throughout the day when you go on and graduate.  Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Oh, Shiiba-san? Meguru: Boy, let me tell you, we searched all over for you.  Shuuji: And Inaba-san, too. Touko: Ah, are you chatting with your friends? Sorry to interrupt.  Shuuji: The gang's all here... Tsumugi: We just wanted to talk about a little something, but we can wait if you're busy.  Shuuji: Ah, no... We're probably done here... Kariya? Wakana: Yep, it's all you from here on out, pal. So get your butt into gear and do something about things! Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Right... So what did you all want to talk about? Tsumugi: So does that mean... You were talking about her with those two? Shuuji: Yeah. They thought we were fighting or something. Are we being that conspicuous? Tsumugi: What do you think? It's so obvious. Especially with Ayachi-san. She's been acting really different. Touko: And not even a week ago you two were stuck together like glue.  Tsumugi: You'd always sneak off together during lunch break, but now you're eating separately.  Meguru: So what's going on here? Meguru: Nene-senpai is the kindest soul out there. What the heck did you do to upset her? Tsumugi: O-Oh no, don't tell me you... you forced yourself on her... or something? Meguru: Ugh! Is super-perv Senpai back at it again?! Shuuji: HECK NO! Man, do you guys seriously think I'd have the guts to do something like that?! I'm a tried-and-true wuss, okay! Tsumugi: I'm not really sure that's something to be proud of.  Touko: Putting that aside for now: I know I don't know what happened... But it's not a fight, right? Shuuji: Yeah, it's not. Meguru: A battle of wills, then? Shuuji: Not quite.  Tsumugi: Personal differences?  Shuuji: You're a little hotter, but still off the mark... Tsumugi: I-I don't know... Meguru: Geez, just tell us already. Touko: She's not... struggling with something, is she? Like a personal issue, maybe.  Shuuji: Hm, that's probably the closest to it.  Meguru: She said it. Pull yourself together, Senpai. Tsumugi: Are you really alright with things staying as they are now? Shuuji: No... I'm not. Shuuji: Heck, this situation is pretty painful on me too. Meguru: Then you know exactly what to do! Tsumugi: Yeah! If you're not satisfied, then you gotta change things! Touko: I don't think deep thought is the answer to everything. Sometimes you just need to clash with your raw emotions.  Shuuji: ...... Touko: It's getting dark out, so I think we should go ahead and call it a day. What do you guys think? Meguru: I agree. We probably won't be getting any students this late.  Tsumugi: Alright, we're gonna go ahead and leave, if that's okay.  Nene: Huh? Wait, huh? Meguru, Tsumugi, Touko: See you tomorrow. Nene: U-Umm... wait... Nene: ...... Nene: Okay... Let's end club for today. I'll go on home after I've locked up, but you can go on and leave now if you want.  Shuuji: That's fine. I'll wait for you.  Nene: ...Huh? Shuuji: I want to talk about something.  Nene: No, I'm alright. It still feels pleasant enough. Shuuji: Alright. I'll walk you home, then. Nene: Do you want to discuss this thing along the way?  Shuuji: Yeah. We can't really talk in private here since there might be kids leaving school from extracurriculars. Nene: Ah, that's true. Shuuji: ...... Nene: Umm... We've already reached my apartment. Did you still want to talk about whatever it was...? Shuuji: Yeah, about that... Shuuji: I want to put an end to this. Nene: So, you mean... Shuuji: Look... I just can't take this any longer. And it all seems pointless anyways... Nene: Ah... nh... ngh...! Nene: ...... Nene: That would be for the best, for both of us... You and I could move on... Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: ...... Nene: You can't do this... You know... You know what'll happen... Shuuji: I don't care. I'm not letting go. Shuuji: I don't like this dumb little test of endurance either, Nene. Nene: Shuuji-kun... Shuuji: I want to go back to being a couple. So please, Nene... Stay by my side. Nene: But you know if we do that it'll― Shuuji: It hurts a million times more to stay apart from you! Shuuji: You're right in front of my eyes, but you feel so, so far away... All I can do is watch helplessly as you suffer, all alone... Nene: Well, I... I feel the same way. It's just as painful for me... Shuuji: I don't want to lose you like this. I want to touch you, I want to hear your voice... I don't want to give up on you... Shuuji: Actually, it's not a matter of want... I simply can't. Nene: ...... Nene: B-But... Shuuji: Do you still remember my confession?  Nene: Of course. I'll never forget it.  Shuuji: After that, we both evaluated our feelings, came to a mutual conclusion, and started going out.  Shuuji: I love you just as much now as I did then.  Nene: ...... Shuuji: You mean the world to me, Nene. No matter what happens, I'll always love you. Even if you came to hate me, for some reason, my feelings for you would remain the same.  Nene: Why are you saying these things to me... You're so cruel... Nene: There's no way my feelings would change... I love you. You know how much I love you! Shuuji: I do. I've been able to feel the pain you've been feeling all this time.  Shuuji: I'm so sorry, Nene... I should've done this much sooner. Shuuji: Let's stop trying to fool ourselves. It makes no sense for us to force ourselves apart when we both love each other.  Nene: But, we can't... Shuuji: I want the person I love to be smiling. The last thing I want are memories of you frowning... looking like you're about to cry.  Shuuji: Spending time with you is the greatest thing in the world to me, but what does that mean if we're just ignoring each other? I've come to realize that over these past few days.  Nene: ...... Shuuji: I want to be with you, Nene. Those are my true and honest feelings. You don't have to worry about hurting me or anything. Shuuji: All I want is to know what you feel. If you think being with me will be too painful to bear, then I'll give up. But if you want to be with me... Nene: We can't... I'll only make you suffer in the process... Shuuji: I've been telling you, it's ten times more painful for me now.  Nene: If we go back to being a couple... You know we'll have less time together... Shuuji: There's no point in having more time if it means I can't spend every moment of it with you.  Nene: I'm a hypocrite, through and through. I told you I wanted you to keep loving me... yet I was the first to give up on you. I even suggested breaking up... Shuuji: Well, I'm not much better, Nene... It took me this long to do this. I made you wait for all that time.  Nene: ...... Shuuji: Is that everything you wanted to say? I'll talk now, if you don't mind.  Shuuji: I'll always be with you, Nene. I won't ever leave you.  Shuuji: I don't want regret to be the last thing I remember you by. I want you to smile, so let's have fun again. Shuuji: If you thought I'd fall out of love with you over this, then you better think again. I'm not giving up. I'm not the kind of guy you can get rid of that easily.  Nene: ......

            "Wakana: Oh, morning, Hoshina. Hideaki: Yo. Shuuji: Morning, guys. Wakana: Yeah, I have... Sorry again for the headaches I caused on Saturday. Shuuji: I'm sorry too. I really screwed up a lot during our act. Wakana, Hideaki: Yeah, you sure did. Shuuji: ...Isn't this the part where you all go, \"Hey, don't worry about it. We weren't much better\"? Wakana: Really, I think we should all be thanking Ayachi-san. Hideaki: Yeah. She really saved our asses. She got the crowd hyped enough to ignore all our screwups. Shuuji: Personally, I would have loved to hear you sing on stage. Wakana: I'll go back to practicing by myself for a while. I learned through this that I still have a long way to go. Hideaki: Well, call me if you ever do plan on playing or singing anywhere. I'll come and listen. Shuuji: Huh? Like, I'm obviously not gonna play again, but can't you join her as a drummer? Hideaki: Look... I've been reminded of a harsh lesson through this... Nobody cares about the drummer! Shuuji: Ah... Nene: O-Oh no, I'm really not that good... I was only able to sing well thanks to the rest of the band. Hideaki: Yeah... But it's way too late for me to switch tracks now. Wakana: There's no way girls would swarm you like that either way. The vocalist should have some class. Hideaki: Especially not if I'm trying to sing while drumming. So yeah, I've officially given up on music for the second time on Saturday. Shuuji: That's kind of a waste, but I guess I have no room to talk since I'm quitting too. Wakana: Exactly. Shuuji: Hm? Nene: E-Excuse me for a moment. I need to talk to Hoshina-kun. Nene: So, it would appear that some of my fragments have returned again. Shuuji: Huh? You mean the fragments I absorbed? Nene: Yes. I haven't received fragments from anywhere else lately. Nene: Absolutely. I only noticed it last night, but... Nene: It must have been the Halloween party when it happened.  Shuuji: ...Now that you mention it, I think I felt a strange sensation around when the party was ending. Nene: Which means the successful party and performance has filled up your heart somewhat again. Shuuji: It's true that I felt a sense of fulfillment and accomplishment. Hmm... Shuuji: Judging by the amount in the bottle, I suppose not all fragments have returned yet, huh? Nene: Yes, unfortunately not. Shuuji: You're not about to tell me to keep playing in the band, are you? I doubt throwing another party would do anything for me. Nene: ...Could you keep going? Shuuji: No. No way. That may have been a fulfilling experience but to continue would be a whole nother story. Shuuji: Like, you wouldn't want me to ask you to keep singing, would you?  Nene: No, I wouldn't. You don't have to worry. I won't make any such requests of you. Shuuji: ...Sorry. I wish I could just give you back these fragments right now. Nene: It's okay. Even if it's little by little, I'm just happy they're coming back. Shuuji: Yeah, but the longer it takes to return your fragments, the longer you'll, umm... keep getting those fits of arousal. Nene: ――― Shuuji: Okay, don't say it! I already know I went too far! Nene: Exactly. My pain would be over if you returned them to me right now... And yet, and yet... Could it be you actually enjoy making me m-m-masturbate? Shuuji: NO! Absolutely not! I'm trying to return them to you as soon as humanly possible! Nene: That look on your face... You don't really want to return them, do you? I see how it is. That must be why you're quitting the band... Shuuji: Now, hold on! You're way off the mark! Please bring back the calm and understanding Ayachi-san! Kanae: Hey, you two. What are you doing outside the classroom? Get your heads out of the party mentality and start focusing on school now. Shuuji: Oh, sorry! Come on, Ayachi-san! Nene: Phew... I'm sorry for acting out this morning. Shuuji: No, it was my fault for bringing it up... Shuuji: Yeah, you're right. So in return... Wait, actually, that's not the right phrasing. Shuuji: Anyway, I've recalled something else. Nene: Okay...? Shuuji: You haven't retrieved fragments from Inaba-san yet, right? Nene: Oh, right. You're correct. I haven't yet. Shuuji: It wasn't possible before, but I wondered about whether it'd be now. Shuuji: It seems like she's getting along better with her classmates lately. Nene: ...Is that so? Shuuji: Yeah. A lot of them voted for her during the party. Shuuji: She finished in eighth place thanks to them. They all surrounded her and complimented her, kinda like what our classmates did with you this morning. Seeing that reminded me about this. Nene: Oh... I didn't know that. Nene: But now that you mention it, she did say that they were going out to eat cake together. Shuuji: Yeah, that is why I wondered if she had any fragments to collect. Nene: ...Yeah, it sounds like retrieval should be possible. Nene: Thank you for the suggestion; it was very helpful. I hadn't thought of that myself. Shuuji: Oh, you're welcome. Shuuji: If it means proving that I'm not stalling just so I can keep you horny, then... Nene: ――― Shuuji: Crap, I said something I shouldn't have again, didn't I?! Nene: I don't care anymore... I'm a filthy m-masturbater. That's just who I am... You don't need to sugarcoat it. Shuuji: Snap out of it! Please! Think about the fragments you may be able to retrieve! Nene: And also, I will look for a good opportunity after school to check whether retrieval is possible. Shuuji: Roger that. Nene: ...... Shuuji: Hm? What is it? Nene: Oh, nothing. I just thought you answered like Inaba-san. Shuuji: ...Oh yeah. I did, huh? That just kinda happened automatically. Nene: ...... Meguru: Hey! Wait for me! Nene: Huh? Inaba-san? Meguru: What have you two been talking about? Let me join the fun! Nene: Nngh. W-Well... Meguru: You went to the clubroom just for that? I didn't know you were such a courteous guy. So you really do care about manners, huh, Senpai? Shuuji: Hey, what's that supposed to mean? Meguru: Actually, why'd you have to be alone for that? This is kinda fishy... Shuuji: Moving on! What brings you to the clubroom? Meguru: Oh, right. I went over to your class to chat with you, but you weren't there. Then Tsumugi-senpai told me you went to the clubroom. Meguru: I thought you might be bragging to everyone about your shiny new armor, so I wanted to set the record straight and let them know I did all the work. Shuuji: What kinda reason is that? Though, I can't deny that it was all thanks to you... Shuuji: Hmm, let's see... I honestly feel bad about being the only one getting help. Shuuji: Like, what about... Ayachi-san? Nene: ...Yeah. Meguru: Oh, right. Don't worry. I'll help you too, of course! Nene: Actually... I've already got it taken care of. Nene: Anyway, Hoshina-kun, we should head back to class now. See you after school, Inaba-san. Meguru: Oh, okay... Roger... Meguru: Hmm... Shuuji: Well? How's it look? Nene: Unfortunately the bottle didn't react. It seems she hasn't yet reached the state where retrieval is possible. Shuuji: Oh, I see... Nene: Like I said before, I can only really guess, but... Nene: Probably once she has found someone she can fully open up to and trust, and vice versa. Shuuji: And she doesn't have anyone like that yet... Meguru: \"And I know how few people there are like me when it comes to friendship, socializing and all that...\" Nene: Pain...? You mean that literally? Shuuji: Yeah. I think the emotion behind that was probably something like fear or regret. Shuuji: Also, I perceived a bittersweet taste. I don't really know what emotion was behind that, but... Meguru: \"I doubt things would've went well even without the cold. Ahaha...\" Shuuji: ...I felt like it was complicated and deep-rooted. Nene: I would have to assume. She must have some deeper concerns if her getting along with her classmates isn't enough. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: ...I want to help her. Shuuji: Oh, yeah, that's certainly a factor, but I want to help her even putting the fragments aside. Shuuji: We promised her that we would help her to do something about this. Nene: ...... Nene: Okay, but I think it would be best if I left this to you. Shuuji: ...Huh? Nene: I feel like that's the best approach. After all... Nene: It seems like you're the one who's closest with her at the moment. Shuuji: W-Wait, that's not... Nene: Am I wrong? Shuuji: W-Well, like, doesn't she always latch onto you the moment she sees you? She doesn't do that with me! Shuuji: It's obvious that she really likes you. But me on the other hand... Nene: ...So then, can I leave this to you? Shuuji: R-Roger that. Shuuji: E-Er, that was on purpose this time! Nene: *stare* Tsumugi: Right. You'll get exhausted at this rate. Nene: I'm sorry... I hope this doesn't keep up for tomorrow... Touko: I think it'll let up after a day. You were pretty blunt when turning them down, so I'm sure everyone will get the message. Nene: I sure hope so... Touko: Anyway, is it alright for me to continue coming? Nene: Of course. I don't mind at all if you don't mind. Touko: I definitely don't mind. I have more free time than I know what to do with now that I've retired from the Student Council. Touko: Doing nothing but studying is so boring, so I'd love to keep coming if that's alright with you. Poor old me has nowhere else to call home anymore... Tsumugi: You're already one of us to me. I'd really like it if you kept coming. Touko: I'm so happy to hear that! Nene: Okay, then. Let's go home for today. Touko, Tsumugi: Okay. "

Shuuji: Maybe, yeah. Tsumugi: Okay then. We'll go on ahead without you. Tsumugi: Ayachi-san, let's go. Nene: Alright. See you later, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Yeah, later. Shuuji: Crap. Kaidou, we gotta go after Kariya. Hideaki: Huh? What for? Shuuji: Kariya, wait up! Wakana: ...... Shuuji: Have you thought about it? Wakana: ...Umm, are you serious? Shuuji: Of course I am, though I'm not gonna force you or anything. Do you hate the idea that much? Shuuji: Just think of it like a private party. There's no pressure. Wakana: You make it sound so easy... Ugghh... Hideaki: What are you talking about? Shuuji: Remember how Kariya has been playing the guitar? Hideaki: Yeah. What about it? Shuuji: She's been practicing for years now but hasn't actually played in front of anyone yet. Shuuji: So I asked her if she'd perform on stage at the upcoming Halloween party. Hideaki: Oh, that'd be awesome! I'll be there too. You gotta let me hear you play! Wakana: No! It's too embarrassing! Hideaki: But you've been at it for a while now, right? Don't you want someone to hear you play? Wakana: Well... I guess I do. Hideaki: He's not being super pushy about it, but you still won't refuse him outright... Doesn't that mean you're actually interested? Hideaki: You actually want to do it, don't you? You're just a little hesitant. Wakana: Well, umm... Hideaki: Come on, admit it. Just tell us how you feel. Wakana: ...... Wakana: Honestly, yeah, I do think that a little... Hideaki: I don't see the problem, then. This'll be like playing at a cultural festival. You just casually strum out a few notes and that's it. Hideaki: Like Shuuji said, think of it like a private party. It's not like you'll be judged by a panel. Just go up there, forget all the little things, and enjoy yourself. Wakana: Ugh, when you put it that way... Hideaki: See! You do want to do it, right? Don't you want to give it a shot? Hideaki: You just got a brand new guitar. Isn't the perfect chance to really put it to use? Wakana: ...... Hideaki: If you let this chance slip, you may never get another. Don't you want to give it a shot at least once? Wakana: Ugh, mmhhhh... Wakana: But it's a party, right? I don't think a solo guitar performance would cut it. Wakana: It would lack impact at such a festive event. Hideaki: Maybe. A solo performance might not be a good fit for a loud party. Wakana: Right? Besides, it'd be my first time playing in front an audience, so I'd be nervous by myself... Shuuji: I see... Wakana: What? That's a stupid idea. Where am I supposed to get other members from? They'd have to be from our school to get in, and I haven't even practiced with a band before. Hideaki: What's the problem? You got me, and you got Shuuji. Looks like a three piece band to me. Wakana: Hey Kaidou... Are you serious right now? Shuuji: You clearly need to think that through more. The two of us are complete amateurs. Or are you telling me that you can play an instrument? Hideaki: I sure can. Drums. Wakana, Shuuji: What? Hideaki: Like I said, I can play drums. Shuuji: Kaidou, my dude... You know that tambourines don't count as drums, right? Hideaki: I know. Wakana: Neither do castanets. Hideaki: Stop treating me like an idiot. Shuuji: But wait, what? You know how to play drums? For real? Hideaki: I formed a band with some friends of mine to pick up some girls. I was the drummer. Shuuji: Oh yeah... You did mention how you had a period where you were into music. You even had a band? Hideaki: Is it really that surprising? I figured most guys had joined a band at least once in their lives to pick up chicks. Wakana: Huh? You really aren't kidding? You're seriously good enough to perform in front of an audience? Hideaki: Sure. Ah, sorry, I shouldn't put it like that. I'm a little rusty since I haven't played in a while. Hideaki: Though, we did play at our school's festival. We even played at a few clubs in the city, you know? Wakana: Seriously?! Hideaki: Yes, seriously. The reason I didn't go to the Halloween party last year was because my band had a gig that day. Hideaki: Though, the venue was a ghost town, so I was probably better off going to the party instead. Hideaki: Performing at a club really isn't all that special. Some of the bands we saw sucked real bad, and they were the most popular ones for some reason. I just don't get it. Hideaki: And even worse, nobody cares about the drummer! You have to sit still in the back where nobody can even see you show off! It's just sad! Hideaki: In the end, we all worked our asses off and got nothing in return. Everyone lost motivation, and we disbanded before summer. Shuuji: Wow... You were a lot more serious than I would've expected. Hideaki: I guess. No experience is ever a waste, as they say. We practiced hard so we could get popular, you know? Hideaki: We formed the band at my old school, so... I guess that means I played with them for around three years. Wakana: I... I can't believe it. Shuuji: That's a pretty long time... Hideaki: I'm not as good as I'm making it sound, though. I'm just an above-average amateur. I mean, our live performances were a mess. Ahaha, that takes me back. Hideaki: We disbanded right when I was starting to hit my stride, I thought. So I'm not a master drummer or anything, but I'm not bad. Wakana: I never would have expected this... Hideaki: Shuuji, you must've joined a band too at some point to get popular, right? Shuuji: Uh, no. I've never really cared about being popular. Hideaki: Huh? Wait, then... you can't play any instrument? None at all? Shuuji: I mean, I guess recorder, or the triangle... Wakana: What are you, a grade schooler?! Hideaki: Oh, so you can't play anything? What a loser. Shuuji: Well gee, sorry for that. Hideaki: But don't you worry. The party isn't till next Saturday; you still got time. Shuuji: ...Huh? What are you saying? Hideaki: Instruments are complex and hard to master, but getting started is surprisingly straightforward. I'm sure it'll work out somehow. Hideaki: Though, I can't say it'll be easy. Shuuji: Wait, wait... You said we'd be a three piece band, so you're telling me to learn the bass guitar? Hideaki: You learned the basics of guitars in music class, right? It'll work out if you put in the effort. Probably. Shuuji: Hold on! You're being a little bit too casual about this! Hideaki: Besides, what did you just say? It's a private party. There'll be no pressure. Shuuji: Kh... You got me there. Hideaki: Oh, what's this? You like to dish out the demands, but can't go through with them yourself? You're just all talk, huh? Shuuji: Tch! Wakana: Uh, no, I haven't said that. Hideaki: Huh? You don't want to form a band with us? Wakana: It's not that I don't want to... But Hoshina hasn't given his okay yet. Hideaki: So it's like I said. If Shuuji says yes, you're on board too. Hideaki: Come on, Shuuji, it all depends on you now. If you're a man, you gotta take responsibility for what you said. Wakana: H-Huh? I feel like you kinda twisted my words there... Err, well, umm... Yeah. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Yeah, but... Hideaki: Then you should take responsibility and do your part, now that it all comes down to you. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: You better help me learn how to play the bass. I am NOT learning how to play that thing on my own, okay? Hideaki: Of course. We don't have the time for that, anyway. The only thing we can do is commit to a song, and then just rehearse it until we get it down. Hideaki: Well then, you cool with this, Wakana-chan? Wakana: Are you sure about this, Hoshina? Shuuji: Kaidou is right. I do want to liven up the party, and I also need to take responsibility for what I said. So yeah, I'll do it. Wakana: But don't you think having to learn the bass in a week is a kinda crazy? Shuuji: Yeah... it is. Shuuji: But I can't back down now! And also... Sorry if I fail miserably! Hideaki: If you do, we'll bear that shame together! Though, I'm sure everyone would just have a laugh and that'd be it. That's how parties are. Wakana: ...Then I'm in. I'm on board too. Hideaki: Hell yeah! We're doing this! Let's have some fun! Shuuji: Yeah, I figured. Shuuji: At least give me a few moments for me to go to the OC and let them know what's up. Shuuji: I really don't want to call it off now after talking such a big game... "

I appreciate that you're fighting over me, but that would cause a few problems for me.  Hideaki: Then just make up with her already and we won't have a reason to fight.  Wakana: Yeah. Get things back to normal between you two. You've only been going out for a week or two, so you're wasting precious time. Hideaki: Every second spent fighting is a second not spent French-kissing. Time is precious. You're not gonna be able to spend this much time together all throughout the day when you go on and graduate.  Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Oh, Shiiba-san? Meguru: Boy, let me tell you, we searched all over for you.  Shuuji: And Inaba-san, too. Touko: Ah, are you chatting with your friends? Sorry to interrupt.  Shuuji: The gang's all here...

You were talking about her with those two? Shuuji: Yeah. They thought we were fighting or something. Are we being that conspicuous? Tsumugi: What do you think? It's so obvious. Especially with Ayachi-san. She's been acting really different. Touko: And not even a week ago you two were stuck together like glue.  Tsumugi: You'd always sneak off together during lunch break, but now you're eating separately.  Meguru: So what's going on here? Meguru: Nene-senpai is the kindest soul out there. What the heck did you do to upset her? Tsumugi: O-Oh no, don't tell me you... you forced yourself on her... or something? Meguru: Ugh! Is super-perv Senpai back at it again?! Shuuji: HECK NO! Man, do you guys seriously think I'd have the guts to do something like that?! I'm a tried-and-true wuss, okay! Tsumugi: I'm not really sure that's something to be proud of.  Touko: Putting that aside for now: I know I don't know what happened... But it's not a fight, right? Shuuji: Yeah, it's not. Meguru: A battle of wills, then? Shuuji: Not quite.  Tsumugi: Personal differences?  Shuuji: You're a little hotter, but still off the mark... Tsumugi: I-I don't know... Meguru: Geez, just tell us already. Touko: She's not... struggling with something, is she? Like a personal issue, maybe.  Shuuji: Hm, that's probably the closest to it.  Meguru: She said it. Pull yourself together, Senpai. Tsumugi: Are you really alright with things staying as they are now? Shuuji: No... I'm not. Shuuji: Heck, this situation is pretty painful on me too. Meguru: Then you know exactly what to do! Tsumugi: Yeah! If you're not satisfied, then you gotta change things! Touko: I don't think deep thought is the answer to everything. Sometimes you just need to clash with your raw emotions.

Let's end club for today. I'll go on home after I've locked up, but you can go on and leave now if you want.  Shuuji: That's fine. I'll wait for you.  Nene: ...Huh? Shuuji: I want to talk about something.  Nene: No, I'm alright. It still feels pleasant enough. Shuuji: Alright. I'll walk you home, then. Nene: Do you want to discuss this thing along the way?  Shuuji: Yeah. We can't really talk in private here since there might be kids leaving school from extracurriculars. Nene: Ah, that's true. Shuuji: ...... Nene: Umm... We've already reached my apartment. Did you still want to talk about whatever it was...? Shuuji: Yeah, about that... Shuuji: I want to put an end to this. Nene: So, you mean... Shuuji: Look...

Nene: But you know if we do that it'll― Shuuji: It hurts a million times more to stay apart from you! Shuuji: You're right in front of my eyes, but you feel so, so far away... All I can do is watch helplessly as you suffer, all alone... Nene: Well, I... I feel the same way. It's just as painful for me... Shuuji: I don't want to lose you like this. I want to touch you, I want to hear your voice... I don't want to give up on you... Shuuji: Actually, it's not a matter of want... I simply can't. Nene: ...... Nene: B-But... Shuuji: Do you still remember my confession?  Nene: Of course. I'll never forget it.  Shuuji: After that, we both evaluated our feelings, came to a mutual conclusion, and started going out.  Shuuji: I love you just as much now as I did then.  Nene: ...... Shuuji: You mean the world to me, Nene. No matter what happens, I'll always love you. Even if you came to hate me, for some reason, my feelings for you would remain the same.  Nene: Why are you saying these things to me... You're so cruel... Nene: There's no way my feelings would change... I love you. You know how much I love you! Shuuji: I do. I've been able to feel the pain you've been feeling all this time.  Shuuji: I'm so sorry, Nene... I should've done this much sooner. Shuuji: Let's stop trying to fool ourselves. It makes no sense for us to force ourselves apart when we both love each other.  Nene: But, we can't... Shuuji: I want the person I love to be smiling. The last thing I want are memories of you frowning... looking like you're about to cry.  Shuuji: Spending time with you is the greatest thing in the world to me, but what does that mean if we're just ignoring each other? I've come to realize that over these past few days.  Nene: ...... Shuuji: I want to be with you, Nene. Those are my true and honest feelings. You don't have to worry about hurting me or anything. Shuuji: All I want is to know what you feel. If you think being with me will be too painful to bear, then I'll give up. But if you want to be with me... Nene: We can't... I'll only make you suffer in the process... Shuuji: I've been telling you, it's ten times more painful for me now.  Nene: If we go back to being a couple... You know we'll have less time together... Shuuji: There's no point in having more time if it means I can't spend every moment of it with you.  Nene: I'm a hypocrite, through and through. I told you I wanted you to keep loving me... yet I was the first to give up on you. I even suggested breaking up... Shuuji: Well, I'm not much better, Nene... It took me this long to do this. I made you wait for all that time.  Nene: ...... Shuuji: Is that everything you wanted to say? I'll talk now, if you don't mind.  Shuuji: I'll always be with you, Nene. I won't ever leave you.  Shuuji: I don't want regret to be the last thing I remember you by. I want you to smile, so let's have fun again. Shuuji: If you thought I'd fall out of love with you over this, then you better think again. I'm not giving up. I'm not the kind of guy you can get rid of that easily.  Nene: ......

Meguru: It's not the same when a guy does it. There is a big difference. Touko: You can't. We've come here today to study. Don't let yourself get sidetracked. Meguru: 'Kaaay... Tsumugi: Okay, should we get right into it, then? Nene: Please use the desk over there. I'm going to prepare tea for us. Shuuji: I'll help you. Nene: You don't have to. I can do that alone. Please just sit down. Shuuji: Yeah? Nene: Oh, thank you. Nene: Repeating that process is the best way to study this, in my opinion. You can learn a lot by solving the same problems every day. Meguru: Still, there's so much to memorize... Nene: Then... try focusing on memorizing everything from here to here first. It'll be easier to remember the rest once you have the basics down. Meguru: Ugh... Roger that... Shuuji: Is there something you're not getting? Tsumugi: Ah, yeah. You see, I don't know how to do this recurrence relation problem here. Shuuji: Yeah, that one's a little tricky. Tsumugi: Hoshina-kun, can you figure it out? Shuuji: Probably. I understood the concept pretty well when we were taught it in class. Though, now that you're asking me about it, I'm not so sure... Tsumugi: How about we try to solve it together, then? Tsumugi: Though, it'll probably be you doing all the work. Shuuji: That's fine. Instead of explaining it, I'll solve the problem while telling you what I'm doing. It might be a little hard to follow, but bear with me. Tsumugi: Don't worry about that. I'm sure I'll remember it that way, even if it's not the best way. Shuuji: Let's give it a try, then. Tsumugi: Yeah. Thank you. Shuuji: Let's see... First, we need a characteristic polynomial... Tsumugi: Yeah, you got it right! Amazing! Shuuji: Yeah? Phew... Tsumugi: Umm... Sorry. I still don't really get it. Shuuji: It's okay. Shuuji: Let's try an easier problem... Actually, maybe you need to brush up on the basics of recurrence relation. Tsumugi: I guess I do, huh? Shuuji: Have you already tried and struggled with the easier problems? Tsumugi: Yeah. Recurrence relation hadn't been taught yet at my previous school, but Himematsu High was already past the basics when I transferred. Shuuji: Ahh. Yeah, that'll do it. Tsumugi: Umm... Could you teach me? Shuuji: Of course. That's why we're here. Tsumugi: Thanks! Shuuji: Then let's get right into it and start from the beginning... Tsumugi: ...... Shuuji: What's up? Tsumugi: Huh? What do you mean? Shuuji: Oh, I just thought that you looked pretty happy for some reason. Tsumugi: Yeah? I guess I am. Getting together with everyone and studying together is so much fun. Tsumugi: Ehehe... I'm having a great time. Tsumugi: I don't know how to describe it, but, umm... It makes me feel better to have someone I can share a forbidden secret with. Shuuji: \"Forbidden secret\" has a pretty suggestive ring to it, you know. Tsumugi: Huh?! Tsumugi: Ah! Th-That's not how I meant it! Not one bit! Shuuji: It actually hurts if you deny it that much... Tsumugi: S-S-S-Sorry! I didn't mean to hurt you! Tsumugi: I told you that's not what I meant! Geez! Tsumugi: Are you doing this on purpose now? You're teasing me, aren't you? Shuuji: I didn't mean to tease you... You were just so cute that I got a little carried away. Tsumugi: ～～～～～?!?!?! I knew you were teasing me! Liar! You meanie! Shuuji: I am. I'm sorry. I got a little too carried away. Tsumugi: ...... Tsumugi: I'm so done with you. I thought that maybe I could help you at Classical Japanese since I'm not bad at it, but not anymore! Shuuji: What?! Wait, I could really use the help with that! Please! Tsumugi: It's your own fault for being a meanie! Touko: Huh? What's wrong? Is there anything you need help with? Shuuji: It's about the translation of \"shikareba\" here. Touko: Lemme see... Ahh, this is Konjaku Monogatari. Touko: It's the perfect tense form of the irregular verb \"shikari.\" By adding on the \"ba,\" it becomes a conjunction that can mean both \"it seems\" and \"by the way.\" Touko: You just need to pick the translation that fits the sentence. Shuuji: Umm... Okay, so I guess it would be the former in this case. \"By the way\" would be weird. Touko: Yup, that's right. It's \"so it seems.\" But you shouldn't be content with just that. You need to learn the full meaning of these words, okay? Shuuji: *sigh* Classical Japanese is such a hassle. Touko: You're not wrong. There's a lot you have to learn. Oh, maybe the Classical Japanese would stick better if you compare it side by side to a Modern Japanese translation. Touko: Besides, when it comes to Modern Japanese, you can be tested on just about anything, but there are only so many Classical Japanese works you can be tested on, right? Touko: It is still quite a lot... But reading just one work can come in handy if you're lucky. Shuuji: Oh, that's true. Shuuji: Really? Then don't mind if I... No, wait. You can just tell me which book it is. I'll get my own copy. Shuuji: You need yours for your own studies, right? Touko: You really don't have to worry about that. Shuuji: No, I couldn't possibly. Touko: But, I mean... Shuuji: What is it? Touko: I need to repay you in some form. Shuuji: Repay me? For what? Touko: You noticed what was going on inside her, right? Shuuji: ...... Touko: You didn't actually invite me out so you could eat a parfait, right? Shuuji: That wasn't a lie... I really did want to try their parfaits. Touko: But there was a deeper reason for you inviting both me and Koshiji-san, wasn't there? Touko: I really don't see it that way. And besides, I'm not upset about it. Touko: Koshiji-san became the new president thanks to that. I'm actually thankful to you. Shuuji: Oh, no, it was nothing. I didn't do anything special. Touko: That's not true. I never noticed her feelings myself... I've always had a hard time with that kind of thing. Touko: If it wasn't for you... I might have done something really cruel and irreversible to Koshiji-san. Touko: So, I'm really thankful to you. Shuuji: I don't know about that... Shuuji: I didn't really do much, so I just feel embarrassed and awkward when you talk about repaying me. Touko: Are you sure? But it'll weigh on my mind if I don't... And I can't repay you with sexual favors... Hmm... Shuuji: Repaying me with sexual favors would put me in an even more awkward position, so please don't. Touko: Okay♪ Then I'll keep teaching you Classical Japanese instead～ Touko: Listen up. \"Ikasamani\" is the continuative form of the adjective \"ikasamanari\" and means \"how\"― Shuuji: H-Hold on a second! Touko: What is it? Is there something you didn't understand? Shuuji: No, that's not it... You're just really close, Senpai. Touko: Am I? But we only have the one textbook. I need to get close to see. Shuuji: I mean, yeah, I guess, but... Shuuji: Wha?! Shuuji: ...Are you sticking this close to me on purpose? Touko: Oh my, what a perv you are. You should get your mind out of the gutter. Shuuji: You know full well what you're doing! Don't you?! Touko: Hmm? Doing what? Shuuji: Err, well, umm... You're purposely... Touko: Come on. I want to hear what you think I'm doing from straight from your cute little mouth～ Shuuji: Y-Your... Touko: My? Shuuji: B-Boo― Touko: Boo? Shuuji: I can't say it! I can't possibly tell you that your boobs are almost touching my arm and that I can't stop thinking about your cleavage! Touko: But you just did. Shuuji: Wh-Who cares about that. Anyway, you seriously have to cut this out! Touko: It's so adorable how red your face is. It makes me want to tease you more. Shuuji: I knew you were doing it on purpose! Touko: Oh, come on. Don't get so angry. Or... do you really not like it? Shuuji: Well, err... I mean, it's not like I DON'T like it... Touko: You really are an honest boy. Shuuji: But it makes me anxious, so please stop. Didn't you say you couldn't do anything sexual? Touko: This was all just an accident. Nothing worth making a fuss over. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: No thanks. Touko: Ahh, you hesitated for a second. You perv～ I was just kidding～ Shuuji: ...You enjoy teasing people a lot, don't you? I could tell back when we ate parfaits together. Touko: That's not true. I was just doting on my cute underclassman a little to show my love. Yup, love♪ Shuuji: Oh, well, if it's out of love... Shuuji: Psh, please. I'm honored, but I seriously can't concentrate that way. So please, spare me. Touko: That's too bad. Then I guess we'll keep studying at a normal distance. Shuuji: ...Thank you. "

Shuuji: Yeah, and I'd rather not get into an argument about it. Nene: Me neither. Our main objective is to see if there are any alps or witches around that we don't know about. Nene: There may also be other victims we haven't discovered yet. Tsumugi: Right! There definitely might be. Nene: Finding those with weakened hearts is just as difficult as finding those with fragments to collect. Nene: Just finding them takes a considerable amount of effort. Nene: But... the more victims we find, the more we'll be able to narrow down the culprit's territory. Tsumugi: Ugh, I sure hope there aren't that many victims.

Nene: Nanao has already been in contact with the nearby alps and has asked them for information. Nene: If this is a habitual criminal, then they may have done similar things in other areas. Shuuji: Hmm... It'll be impossible to track them down if they work in that large of an area. Tsumugi: We'll just have to do what we can.

Tsumugi: How did you search for me before I joined the OC? Tsumugi: Ayachi-san realized there was another witch around, right? Shuuji: We didn't really do anything. Shuuji: We just found someone who had retrievable fragments and waited for you to show up. Shuuji: Basically, we baited you. Tsumugi: Then why don't we bait out the culprit too? Tsumugi: We can just look for people who have retrievable fragments. Shuuji: I dunno. Our culprit here doesn't obtain fragments the usual way. That's why we're in this predicament. Shuuji: Let's keep that idea as a last-ditch effort but think of something else for now. Tsumugi: Right. Hmm... Oh! How about I transform into a witch and keep a lookout for people who can see me? Shuuji: No, that's way too dangerous. Shuuji: They'll be able to tell who we are, but we won't know who they are. Shuuji: And there's a good chance that whoever this is knows how to fight. Shuuji: Yeah... Shuuji: Right... And if we find a witch, we should be able to find their alp before too long. Tsumugi: Is something wrong, Shuuji-kun? Shuuji: N-No. I'm just a bit tired. Shuuji: I'm fine. I just need to rest for... Oh crap! Tsumugi: Did you spot something? Shuuji: N-No. Shuuji: I think I'm... gonna return to human form in a minute. Shuuji: Yeah. It's not like there's a fixed time when I go back to being human. Looks like it's early today. Tsumugi: What do we do? Want to escape from this crowd somewhere? Shuuji: We won't be able to make it all the way back to your place in time. Tsumugi: Right. Actually, isn't there a place nearby we could go? Shuuji: Where do you mean? Tsumugi: Hehehe. Have you forgotten, Shuuji-kun? Shuuji: ......? Shuuji: Ah, sorry. I shouldn't be neglecting my guest. Tsumugi: No, it's fine. It's been a while since you've come home.

Have you forgotten our promise? Shuuji: I-I did, but does that still apply here? Shuuji: Because you're worried about my dad? Tsumugi: Yes, kind of, but also because you don't have a change of clothes. Tsumugi: It hasn't been a big deal so far since you're only human for a few hours each day, but...

Tsumugi: Hehehe, despite everything you say, you really are worried about your dad. Shuuji: N-No I'm not. Shuuji: But anyway... If he comes home, he's not gonna have any idea who I am, is he? Tsumugi: Hmm, I dunno. That would probably turn into a pretty messy situation. Shuuji: Right. It'd be like he suddenly found two strangers in his own home. Tsumugi: He should remember me, though. Shuuji: Oh yeah. You met him when I was sick. Well, it's not like he's gonna come home at this time, anyway. Tsumugi: So, where do you keep your clothes? Shuuji: Oh, in that dresser there. Shuuji: Hey, what do you think you're doing?! Tsumugi: Y-You'll need these too, right? Tsumugi: Y-You don't need to be embarrassed about it. Shuuji: You're the one who's blushing. Tsumugi: I-I mean, it's possible that, in the future, I'll... Tsumugi: ...H-Have to wash your underwear, isn't it? Shuuji: ...Huh? Tsumugi: Oh... It isn't? Shuuji: No, it's definitely possible... I mean, that'd be nice... Tsumugi: Yeah... Ehehe. Then it's fine, right? Tsumugi: Let me prepare your clothes for you. Shuuji: That's fine. Save that for later... We need to keep our promise, first. Tsumugi: Shuuji-kun... Ah... *kiss* Mm, mmpah... *kiss* Mm, mmm! Shuuji: I love you, Tsumugi. Tsumugi: Have you... gotten in the mood for something naughty? Tsumugi: I-If so, could you say that again? Shuuji: I love you. I love you, Tsumugi! Tsumugi: Thanks. I love you too, Shuuji-kun! Hiyah! Shuuji: Tsumugi... *kiss* A-Are you sure? Tsumugi: I am... Could you sit over there? "

Oh, are these things leftover from Halloween? They have jack-o'-lanterns! Shuuji: So they do. That brings back memories. Shuuji: Mostly of you in your Halloween costume. Tsumugi: Ehehe, yeah... You arranged the whole thing for me. Tsumugi: I'm sure I'll remember that every Halloween from now on. Shuuji: You think? Tsumugi: Yeah...

Meguru: You're the worst. Shuuji: ...I'm seriously sorry. Tsumugi: Well, it was break time, and the door was locked... You normally wouldn't think I could be changing inside. Shuuji: Err, well... Yeah. I didn't expect it at all. Nene: I'm very sorry. I should have informed Hoshina-kun beforehand. Tsumugi: You don't need to apologize. There was no time for that since it was just after P.E., right? So... No one is to blame there. Tsumugi: Really, don't worry about it. Actually, umm... Rather than you apologizing, I would like you to forget. Tsumugi: L-Let's just say you never saw anything. Shuuji: Got it. I haven't seen anything. Shuuji: I didn't see you in your underwear at all. Tsumugi: Fueeeeeeaaaahhh! Shuuji: Ahh! Sorry! I didn't mean to say that! I'll forget about it! I'll forget everything! Meguru: I can't tell if you're a pervert or just an idiot! Why would you go in for an extra blow in this situation, super-perv Senpai?! Shuuji: Yeah, I have no excuse. Shuuji: I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Meguru: But why were you changing in the clubroom, anyway, Shiiba-senpai? Nene: I suggested doing so because it looked like she was embarrassed by changing in the locker room. Nene: I already had the key on me, so the clubroom was the first room I thought of for changing in... Shuuji: Why was it embarrassing? You're all girls. Tsumugi: Well, umm... You see, I really surprised everyone when I entered the locker room to change before P.E. Tsumugi: And then actually changing was really embarrassing too. Shuuji: Because everyone was already looking at you? Tsumugi: Partly, yeah... But also, everyone else was able to skillfully change without fully taking off their uniforms. Shuuji: Without taking off their uniforms...? Like how elementary schoolchildren change into swimsuits? Tsumugi: Yeah, right... Shuuji: Girls do that even though it's only other girls in the locker room? Tsumugi: Yeah, they do. Shuuji: Is that common? Nene: Yes. Even when it's with other girls, it's still uncomfortable to be seen half-naked. Meguru: Right. And there's stuff like not wanting to be laughed at for the underwear you're wearing. Shuuji: Is that so? Nene: There's a lot to consider with underwear, such as the comfort level. You tend to wear your most comfortable underwear more often... Nene: But they wear out quickly when you do that, so... Ah! Don't make me say weird stuff like that! Shuuji: No! You did this yourself! Don't blame me for blurting that out on your own! Shuuji: I don't want to know about that kind of stuff, anyway! Tsumugi: But anyway, I can't get around taking off my pants, right? Which is why, umm... I can't avoid letting everyone see my underwear. Shuuji: Well... If you don't take measures beforehand, that's how it turns out, yeah. Tsumugi: Besides, everyone kept looking at me.  Tsumugi: \"She's wearing a boy's uniform, but what about her underwear? Is she wearing a chest binder?\" You could tell that's what everyone was thinking. Shuuji: Yeah, I can see that. Meguru: To be perfectly honest, I've been a little curious about that myself. Tsumugi: I-I'm wearing perfectly normal girls' underwear! I can't show you, though... Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Oh, uh, absolutely nothing! Meguru: But despite that, you ended up experiencing something even more embarrassing... Nene: But you can't keep changing in the clubroom, so we need to come up with another solution. Tsumugi: Right... *sigh* Meguru: Heh heh heh. This is my time to shine. Nene: What do you mean? Meguru: Remember how we talked about changing her hairstyle yesterday? Shuuji: Oh yeah... You mean how changing her hairstyle could change everyone's impression of her? Meguru: Exactly. So, I've already gotten everything ready! Tsumugi: R-Really?! Meguru: Yep! So please, sit down here! I'll do your hair for you. Tsumugi: U-Umm... Okay, thank you so much. Meguru: ～～～♪ Meguru: You have nothing to be embarrassed about! I'm so jealous of your glossy hair. I wish I had hair like that. Tsumugi: You shouldn't worry about that. I mean, your fluffy hair is totally cute. Meguru: I'd rather have it be glossy and silky. But really, your hair is just fantastic～ Nene: Is it that amazing? Meguru: Go ahead and touch it yourself, Nene-senpai. Nene: Okay then, if Shiiba-san doesn't mind... Nene: Wow, it really is smooth. How nice... I'm getting a little jealous myself. Meguru: Oh, please. You have no right to be jealous. Just look at how silky your hair is! Nene: Ah, d-don't! It tickles when you touch me there. Meguru: How interesting... Your nape is ticklish, is it? Tsumugi: Fueh? Ah, hey, sto―! Ahhnn! Shuuji: ...... Tsumugi: Geez, knock it off～ Nene: Inaba-san, no means no, okay? Meguru: 'Kay! Shiiba-senpai, sorry about that. I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable. Shuuji: Is it really that smooth? Mind if I― Nene, Meguru, Tsumugi: ...... Shuuji: Ah, right. Of course I can't. I just thought it wouldn't hurt to ask. Don't mind me. Tsumugi: Y-Yeah, okay. Nene: Shiiba-san, are there any specific hairstyles that you would like? Tsumugi: Let me think... Not really. Anything cute will do! Meguru: Anything cute? Roger that! Meguru: Then, I guess I'll go with this accessory... Or maybe this one? Which would look better? Nene: If she wants to look cute, then I would say this one here, no? Meguru: Ah! That one is great! Way to go, Nene-senpai! You have great taste. Tsumugi: U-Umm, I'm not really used to this kind of thing, so I'm kind of uneasy about it. Just take it slow, okay? Take it slow. Meguru: I'm not sure what there is to be uneasy about... But if that's what you want, then let's just go for a cute hairstyle with no accessories. Meguru: ～～～♪ Nene: A braided hairstyle? Like, in pigtails?  Meguru: Right. Some manga have pretty boys who wear braids, so I think it's worth a try. Tsumugi: I've never braided my hair before. Meguru: Don't worry about it. Your hair is long enough, and it's pretty easy to do. Meguru: Just divide the hair into three strands, cross one outer strand over the middle one, then the other, and... Meguru: Voila! What do you think, Shiiba-senpai? Tsumugi: Umm... Ah, good. It looks like I'm fine! "

Shuuji: Wait, what?! Akagi: I simply thought that it would be better for me not to know. Shuuji: ...... Akagi: After all, the girl no longer knows anything about me either.

Akagi: She even lost her friend in order to have her wish fulfilled. Akagi: If I remember correctly... Her name was Inaba Meguru. Akagi: I don't understand much about friendship, but it's something humans value, is it not? And Chihoko has lost her only one. I have no idea where and how Chihoko or that Meguru girl are living their lives now... Meguru: ...... Touko: Hmm, it's so quiet when it's just two of us. Touko: I'm trying to liven things up, but I'm the only one talking. Meguru: ...I'm sorry. Touko: Ooh, you actually said something!

Wh-What the heck is happening?! Shuuji: I'll explain later. Just come with me! Shuuji: We've found out what happened to Kizuki-san! Meguru: Huh? Chi-chan...? Nene: ―And that about covers it. Magic is real, and we are witches. Nene: You need to know these things, or else you'll find it hard to comprehend what we're about to talk about. Nene: I know this must be sudden, but please accept it for now. Meguru: O-Okay...? Meguru: Oh, well, umm... This doesn't seem like the kind of thing you can go around telling people willy-nilly, so umm, like... I don't really mind. Meguru: Actually, I feel kinda bad because I'm not sure I'm really following all this... Nene: I can explain any of the finer details you don't understand later. Nene: Togakushi-senpai, the same goes for you. Touko: Gotcha. I'm already grateful enough to be included in this.  Meguru: ...S-So, umm! Meguru: Senpai, you said you found out about Chi-chan... Shuuji: Yeah... We actually found someone who knows Kizuki-san. Shuuji: Akagi, can you take it from here? Akagi: Of course. Akagi: Rest assured, I'm not as young as I look. I am much older than you and Chihoko. Akagi: ...So you're Meguru, huh? My name is Akagi. I have heard a lot about you from Chihoko. Akagi: Mainly that you were her one and only friend. Her best friend. Meguru: ......!! Meguru: P-Please! Please tell me about Chi-chan! Akagi: In due time. Let us sit down, first. Meguru: Okay! Akagi: Also... Hey, I want my milk! Meguru: A-A glass of milk, please! Akagi: Haha... I had already ordered the milk, lass. Meguru: ...Huh? What the heck is \"milk glass\"? Shuuji: No, she said \"lass.\" She doesn't talk like a normal girl. Just think of her as your typical unaging loli. Meguru: ...Oh yeah! I see those in games and stuff all the time. Makes sense. Meguru: Ahaha... Milk is fine for me too. Akagi: Excellent choice. Matching drinks for the who share a bond with Chihoko. Akagi: Indeed, I can. I shall explain everything from the beginning. Meguru: What...? Akagi: That is, she was a witch. She had a wish that she wanted more than anything. Akagi: And so we formed a contract to fulfill that wish, thus making Chihoko my witch. Akagi: ...Meguru, do you understand everything so far? Meguru: Yeah... Meguru: I had no idea Chi-chan was a witch... Akagi: Your surprise is only natural. Witches tend not to talk about magic to those unrelated to our craft. Akagi: But it is different now; you have already been informed about us. Hence, I'm able to tell you now. It was necessary in order explain her current situation. Tsumugi: Actually I didn't know about that either. Tsumugi: You never told me that you made a contract with Chihoko-chan while you already had a contract with me... Shuuji: Oh, yeah... I guess that would've had to have been the case. Akagi: It's not as if I did anything wrong. There is no rule that says alps can only have one contractor. Nanao: Don't act like that's normal. We usually don't have more than one witch at a time. Shuuji: A-Anyway... Akagi, Shiiba-san was already your witch at the time? Akagi: Correct. Shuuji: Then why did you form a contract with Kizuki-san? Shuuji: Meguru, Kizuki-san used to live around here, right? Meguru: Y-Yeah. Chi-chan's place was about a 10-minute walk from my house. Akagi: I had no special reason. The girl vacationed in the town where I and Tsumugi were. She and I got to know each other, and then we exchanged a contract. That is all. Akagi: And so, for a time, I occasionally visited this town to check in on her. Akagi: But, well... because of that, there may have been a minor territorial dispute with that cat over there. Nanao: I don't want to hear it, bird. This is why I can't deal with winged creatures. Nanao: You put me through a lot, back then. Akagi: But I'll actually go crazy if I don't travel every once in a while. Maybe because I used to be a migratory bird. A cat wouldn't understand. Nanao: Oh well, it's all in the past. I don't want to start a fight in front of Nene. Akagi: Good. But we digress. Akagi: Getting back on topic... I assume you wish to know what happened to Chihoko after that? Meguru: Y-Yeah! I do! Akagi: Then I shall tell you. Where should I start... Akagi: Chihoko started gathering fragments shortly after becoming my witch. Akagi: But this was more difficult for her than most other witches. Akagi: After all, the emotional price she had to pay was an unusually harsh one... Akagi: And to make matters worse, I was only occasionally around. I couldn't offer my support around the clock.  Akagi: However, despite the obstacles set before her, she cleared them all and completed her magic. Akagi: She was just that desperate to complete her wish. Akagi: It shows how important that wish was to her. Meguru: What was it... that Chi-chan had wished for? Akagi: ...... Akagi: \"I want you to cure Megu-chan's disease.\" Meguru: ...... Meguru: I've never had any disease that― Akagi: I thought so. I had a feeling this would be the case. Akagi: Chihoko's departure must have been a tremendous shock that left you scarred. Akagi: But your body, on the other hand, seems as healthy as can be. Meguru: Wait! Wait a moment... I can't deny the part about the hole in my heart, but... Meguru: It wasn't me who was sickly, but Chi-chan... Akagi: ...While Chihoko was a quiet and slender girl, she didn't have any serious illnesses. Akagi: The tremendous shock must have jumbled up your memories.  Meguru: ...... Akagi: Or perhaps having your body cured overnight caused your brain to process it that way in order to keep things logically consistent. Akagi: Either way, it was you who had been suffering from an incurable illness. I had heard so from none other than Chihoko herself. Akagi: She told me that, due to your weak body, you stayed at home most days reading books.  Meguru: Ah... Akagi: She also told me that you often played video games together. You're quite good at them, are you not? Meguru: ...I-I guess. Akagi: But I also need to talk about the price she paid in order to see that wish fulfilled. Akagi: For that price is what had caused your separation. Meguru: Wh-What kind of price was it? Akagi: Listen well. The number of fragments required fulfill her wish was excessive, perhaps due to the strength of the disease you were afflicted with. Akagi: And on that same token, the emotional price she had to pay was unusually heavy. Akagi: For instance... Tsumugi. The price you're paying is also harsh, but the worst that can happen is some nausea, and you're otherwise fine as long as you dress in men's clothes, correct? Tsumugi: Y-Yeah, right. It's pretty harsh for me personally, but there's no danger involved or anything... Akagi: ...But it wasn't the same for Chihoko. Akagi: There was no way to fully avoid her price, and no loopholes to avoid triggering it. Akagi: It was the kind of price that came with permanent consequences. Consequences that would last even after her wish was fulfilled. Akagi: And that was the issue... Meguru: I can't take this anymore. Just tell me already! What happened to Chi-chan?! Akagi: The price she paid was... Akagi: Forgetting anyone she was close to. Meguru: Ah... Akagi: Don't complain to me. No one can predict the kind of price you'll get in advance. Akagi: That was simply the price she got. That's all there is to say. Meguru: Then, Chi-chan... Akagi: ...Needless to say, she was stunned when she first learned of her price. And at first, she blamed me heavily for it. Akagi: However, she quickly resolved herself. Akagi: In order to avoid causing needless distress, she proceeded to gradually distance herself and cut ties from everyone she knew. Akagi: Yet she couldn't bring herself to do the same for you. Akagi: Even though she would eventually forget you as well... she endured that fear and remained by your side. Meguru: B-But why... Why would she go so far? Akagi: Well, because you were her best friend. Meguru: ...... Akagi: She told me this... Akagi: \"Megu-chan is actually a very cheerful girl. She's a wonderful person that anyone could come to love.\" Akagi: \"I'm really bad at making friends and only have Megu-chan, but deep down, she's different.\" Akagi: \"And to think she told me I'm her one and only friend. Her best friend in the whole world.\" Akagi: \"She said that as long as she has me, she doesn't need other friends.\" Akagi: \"Hearing that made me so very happy...\" Akagi: \"And so... I want to thank her.\" Akagi: \"I want to repay Megu-chan somehow.\" Akagi: \"I want to make the friend I'm so proud of be able to cheerfully run around outside.\" Akagi: \"I want her to be loved by everyone in her class.\" Akagi: \"Even if I end up forgetting about her...\" Akagi: \"...I want to help her become able to face life without me.\" Akagi: \"And to achieve that, I want to complete our contract and cure her disease.\" Meguru: ...... Akagi: The first to be forgotten was her parents. Akagi: They were beyond startled. They talked about medical examinations and surgery. They eventually decided to move somewhere far away for their daughter to live. Akagi: And then... At the very end, she even forgot her precious friend. The one her magic was meant for in the first place. Akagi: As a result... you ended up suddenly losing your best friend. Akagi: The lack of farewells was only natural. Chihoko had lost her memory of you by that point. Akagi: That was when her parents cut all ties to their life here and moved away with their daughter... Tsumugi: So that's what happened... Nene: That's why the school didn't have any records... Touko: ...You really don't where she went? Not even you? Akagi: No. I have no idea where she is living currently. Akagi: It is probably for the best to not look for her. I have no intention of doing that either. Akagi: It would likely only bother her and her parents and possibly even cause her undue stress. Meguru: So then... She's just... Shuuji: Kh... Akagi: Meguru, do you understand what that means? Meguru: Well... Meguru: Chi-chan cured my disease, but in exchange, she doesn't remember me anymore... Akagi: That's right! But to do that... Akagi: ...She saw it through to the end, even after she had already forgotten about you. Meguru: Ahh...! Akagi: Even I was surprised by that. Akagi: She really didn't remember you anymore. Akagi: But she told me that she could tell how important this was to do. Akagi: That by doing this, she was sure her wish would come true. Akagi: Despite the fact that she didn't even remember who that wish would cure anymore. Akagi: At the very end, she even forgot me. And yet, she still saw it through. Akagi: ...Chihoko was an amazing human. She said that she wanted this to serve as her farewell. Akagi: She may have forgotten you... But the magic she brought to life in exchange was literally Chihoko herself. Akagi: And that magic is now living on in your heart, Meguru. Meguru: Ah, aah... Meguru: Yeah...! Meguru: Senpai...! Akagi: That's right. Meguru: Thanks to Chi-chan... I... Meguru: I never left her thoughts... Meguru: My good health was Chi-chan's last gift to me. Meguru: It's Chi-chan's memories that are giving me life! Meguru: I...! I had never lost my best friend! Meguru: I haven't been able to do anything for Chi-chan! Meguru: It's so painful... I don't know how I can possibly repay Chi-chan for all she's done. Akagi: ...Let me tell you something here and now, Meguru. Akagi: I'm sure you were but an empty shell after losing Chihoko. Meguru: Y-Yeah... Akagi: But the girl I see today isn't just healthy. Akagi: She's surrounded by many friends. You're loved dearly. Everyone you see here now is giving you their full support, are they not? Meguru: Akagi... Akagi: Furthermore, I was honestly taken aback when I saw you today. Akagi: You are nothing like the child Chihoko described to me. You have a serious sense of fashion and, how should I put this... You're a real looker. Meguru: I'm dressing like this because... Akagi: You needn't say it. Both I and Chihoko know. Akagi: You recovered and got back on your feet because you knew that you couldn't let things continue as they had been, am I right? Meguru: Ah... Akagi: I am positive that was what Chihoko was truly wishing for. So rest assured! Akagi: For you have fulfilled Chihoko's wish as well. Meguru: ～～～～! Meguru: Waaaaaaah! Meguru: I'll do my best! I'll live strong for you! Meguru: You don't have to worry anymore... I'm strong now. Meguru: Wahh... Waaaaaah! "

Shuuji: Your advice really helped me a lot. So thank you for that.  Touko: It wasn't much of anything special, but if it helped, then I'm glad.  Touko: Fights happen from time to time in relationships, no matter how much you love each other. You just have to not be stubborn about things, and consider what you truly value.  Shuuji: Yeah.

Kinda like with this, when he makes up his mind to do something, he gives it 110\\%.  Touko: If you just look at it on paper, it could work out, but... Meguru: The problem being she answered question number 11 with \"Shouldn't happen.\" That seems like a preeetty big hurdle to overcome... Shuuji: Well, it's up to Kaidou to make up his mind after seeing it. I'll go tell him the results in a bit. Tsumugi: So are we basically done for today, then?  Touko: Ah, one thing before that. I need to collect everyone's surveys. Have you guys all filled them out?  Meguru: Uh-huh. Here's mine.  Tsumugi: I did mine too. Just promise me you won't look. I'm a little embarrassed.  Touko: I won't, I won't. There'd be no point in making it anonymous if I did. Just give it to me face down and I'll shuffle it in with the rest. Shuuji: Ahh, crap... Sorry. I forgot to do mine... Touko: Come on now, Hoshina-kun. You gotta keep your promises. Nene: I'm sorry... I actually forgot to do mine too. Touko: Even you did? Meguru: Wow. You never make silly mistakes like forgetting to do something.  Touko: Do you have the surveys on you? Shuuji: Sorry. I think I left mine on my table at home... Touko: Well, nothing we can do about that. Just make sure you get them to me tomorrow after school and I'll take them to the Newspaper Club with the rest. Shuuji: Okay. Nene: Thank you.  Shuuji: Also, she basically lives the life of a single, middle-aged man. Here's a basic summary of her answers.  Shuuji: So do you know what you're gonna do? Hideaki: Nope. But now that I got this information, I'm gonna give it some serious thought. Hideaki: Looking at this stuff, though... Shit, how do I confess? What approach is gonna do me the best... Hideaki: I just hope I find something I can use as a starting point.  Shuuji: Look, you don't have to force yourself to go through with it now because of our help.  Hideaki: Besides, getting it off my chest helped out a lot. I'll be able to think about everything calmly.  Shuuji: Glad to hear. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Just curious... But what exactly does it feel like to love someone so much you feel like you're going crazy?  Hideaki: Well... Didn't I already tell you? You think about that person 24/7 and can't help it.  Hideaki: You want to talk with her, you follow her with your eyes whenever you're around her. You try and think of ways to spend time with her and get jealous over the dumbest things... Hideaki: Frankly speaking, it's all shit that seems pretty creepy when you stop and think about it.  Hideaki: But no matter how weird you think it is, you can't do a damn thing to stop it. When you see her having fun or smiling, it's the sweetest feeling in the world. Shuuji: You find yourself staring at her when she smiles?  Hideaki: Oh, you betcha. Happens all the time.  Shuuji: What about dreams? Do you dream about her too? Hideaki: Occasionally. That happens when you're thinking about her 'round the clock. Awake or asleep doesn't matter.  Shuuji: Hmm... I see... Shuuji: No, no, it's nothing! Hideaki: You're a goddamn open book, I swear.  Shuuji: ...... Hideaki: No need to hide it, man. Nothing embarrassing about being in love with Ayachi-san. Anybody would with a girl that cute around.  Shuuji: It's not like I'm embarrassed about― Shuuji: Wait, how did you narrow it down to Ayachi-san? Hideaki: Oh-ho, what is that I hear? Do you dare try to deny it?  Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: ...Was it that obvious? Hideaki: Definitely. I'd say anyone who knows you a bit better would notice immediately. Shuuji: Well... I guess she doesn't mind me. Shuuji: Well, a lot's happened.  Hideaki: So are you gonna tell her? I can tell you, you're sure as hell not gonna get anywhere if you just keep wracking your brains over it.  Shuuji: ...Hmm. Shuuji: What do you think I should do? Hideaki: That's for you to decide, man. It's your life, not mine.  Shuuji: That's what you say after egging me on to confess? Hideaki: Hahahaha. What I'm basically saying is, give it some serious thought.  Shuuji: Yeah. Hideaki: Oh right. Would you mind letting me return the key? Shuuji: Sure, fine by me... Do you want to talk to Sensei? Hideaki: You're not supposed to say it, man.  Hideaki: We're here to return the key. Kanae: Hm? Ah, right. Thanks. Kanae: But seriously, just what were you two guys doing in there two days in a row? Shuuji: Completely normal things.  Hideaki: Don't go spreading any funny rumors about us now, Kanae-chan. Kanae: Don't call me Kanae-chan. And especially not in the faculty room. Hideaki: Sorry, just a slip of the tongue. Hahaha. Shuuji: ...... "

Tsumugi: Don't worry about it. We're only getting people looking for some fortune telling. How's your practice coming along? Shuuji: I'm getting there... I think? I'm working pretty hard at it, at least. Tsumugi: Ahaha. Well, don't overwork yourself. Shuuji: I won't. Wait... Where'd Kariya go? Tsumugi: Huh? Oh, she's not here. Maybe she already went home? Shuuji: Huh? That's no good... I'll head to the clubroom in a bit, okay? Tsumugi: Oh, okay. I'll let Ayachi-san know. Wakana: Nn! Shuuji: Wait a second... *pant* *pant* Wakana: Wh-What is it? Shuuji: After you're done with work for the day, do you think that, maybe... you could help me practice? Wakana: Huh? A-Again? Shuuji: Yeah. There's not much time before the performance. You're, err... not gonna say it's too awkward, are you? Wakana: ...... Wakana: Umm... D-Did something happen... to make it awkward? Shuuji: Well... Wakana: ...... Shuuji: Huh? What was? Wakana: I mean... it is awkward. Us pretending it never happened is just gonna make things worse, isn't it? Shuuji: ...Yeah. I don't think we need to pretend it didn't happen. It's not like we did anything wrong. Wakana: Y-Yeah! It was an accident. A total accident! Wakana: And anyway, we should be focusing on practice! We don't have the time to be thinking about such a silly accident! Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Yeah, you're right! We need to focus on practice! Wakana: Okay, that's a promise! Wakana: Though... I still do have work today, sorry. Wakana: But I'm happy to help you practice when I'm done! Shuuji: Great, thanks. Wakana: Yeah! Later! Shuuji: Alright! Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: How was that? I think I've gotten pretty decent. Wakana: Amazing! I can't believe it! You played that awesomely! Shuuji: Well, I wouldn't go that far. Wakana: No, it really was awesome! Shuuji: I appreciate the compliment... but I'm not perfect yet. I'm still making a lot of mistakes with my fingering. Wakana: Yeah, I guess there are still bits that aren't perfect. Shuuji: Right? Wakana: But you're bound to make at least some mistakes during the actual show. No matter how well you do in practice, you're still just a beginner. Shuuji: Yeah. I'm definitely gonna be nervous performing for an audience. Just the thought of getting on-stage is nerve-wracking. Wakana: Same here. I'm sure I'll screw up some too. It's something that happens to anyone inexperienced. Wakana: What's important is not panicking and recovering from your mistakes. You have to reposition yourself ASAP. Wakana: So I think we need to focus on learning how to recover whenever we screw up. Wakana: I mean, making mistakes isn't a good thing; that's why we practice. But we'll just make asses of ourselves if we focus too much on being perfect, don'tcha think? Shuuji: ...Yeah, I get what you're trying to say. Wakana: Right. You made a few mistakes, but you were in a really good groove. That's almost as important as your fingering technique. Shuuji: G-Groove? Wakana: Yeah. It's like rhythm. You were great just now, Hoshina. Even Kaidou would have to admit it. Shuuji: Speaking of Kaidou, where is he today? Wakana: He said he had to go see the guy who's helping him move the drums. He's gonna be in for a shock next time he hears you play. Wakana: Oh? You accepted that surprisingly quickly. I was sure you were gonna be all \"that's not true,\" and start some kinda argument. Shuuji: You're going out of your way to compliment me, so I figured the least I could do is accept it. Wakana: Huh? What's gotten into you? This is so not like you. Shuuji: Well... Wakana: Y'know, you've been looking pretty well lately, Hoshina. Shuuji: Am I that different? Wakana: Totally different. The you now compared to the you who always had to force a smile are worlds apart. Well, I might be exaggerating a little, but you get the point. Wakana: The fact that you're actually getting involved in group things like this makes me happy. Shuuji: ...You must be comparing me now to when I was still a kid, huh? Wakana: Yeah. But you really have changed. Shuuji: You'd know. I mean, we've known each other for what, almost ten years now? Wakana: Right... I guess it has been that long. Wakana: Hm? Shuuji: You spoke to me back then 'cause you realized we used to be classmates, yeah? Wakana: Yeah. What of it? Shuuji: You recognized me right away? Wakana: Yeah, pretty much. You felt completely different. It was as if you'd lost all your confidence. Wakana: But it was that difference that made me curious and got me talking to you. Shuuji: What's that mean? That you would have ignored me if I hadn't changed? Wakana: Haha, who knows? Wakana: Not like you're one to talk when you didn't even recognize me at all. Shuuji: Well... Wakana: People always say I haven't grown much, or that I don't look any different, or that my \"body\" hasn't matured... Wakana: ...... Wakana: Graahh! Who the hell do you think you're calling flat-chested?! Shuuji: I didn't say anything! Calm down! Wakana: But you didn't recognize me even though I hadn't changed! I'm gonna sue your ass! Shuuji: Oh, come on! I told you how sorry I was about that! Shuuji: I remember some things... Wakana: Then do you remember anything about me? Shuuji: About you? Let's see... Wakana: Wh-What's wrong, Hoshina? Shuuji: Nothing... Wakana: Oh, okay... So you don't remember anything? Shuuji: Hold on a sec, I'm still trying to think. Umm... Wakana: Oh? What is it? Shuuji: You came over to speak to me once. I think it was during recess. You asked me what book I was reading. Wakana: Huh? I did? Shuuji: You did. I'm sure of it. Wakana: Hmm... Did that really happen? Shuuji: Right? Wakana: And then you said, \"Why are you talking to me? You don't look like you want to.\" Shuuji: ...Huh? Was I really that rude? Wakana: Yup! You totally were! I mean, that's what you were always like. That's why it was so hard for people to talk to you. Shuuji: Ahh, yeah... I guess I was a bit antisocial. Shuuji: At least I realize it now. I kinda regret it, really. Wakana: Well... You're a bit more approachable now, so it's alright. Wakana: It doesn't matter now. And it's not like it made me hate you or anything. Shuuji: ...So, why did you decide to speak to me, anyway? There must have been a reason. Wakana: Th-There wasn't any... really special reason... or anything. Wakana: ...... Wakana: Huh? Shuuji: Ah! Wakana: Wh-Why are you asking me this now? Shuuji: I-I just kinda felt like it. Wakana: Hmm... Well, I've never been really good with the topic. I wouldn't even know if I did like someone. Shuuji: ...Makes sense. Wakana: Why are you agreeing with me on that?! Shuuji: You're the one who said it! Wakana: Well what about you, Hoshina?! Is there someone you like?! Well, is there?! Shuuji: There's no one I like, and I've never had a girlfriend before. I never even kissed anyone until―Oh, err, nevermind. Wakana: ...... Shuuji: ...... Wakana: Th-The studio's pretty hot, right? Shuuji: Yeah! The weather's getting colder, but it's a freaking boiler room in here! I'm sweating all over! "

            "Nanao: Yes, in all kinds of ways. You would never expect an alp to tell anyone about their contractors, especially not in the presence of another alp. Nanao: Not to mention how both alps are willingly partaking in this. And also... Well, let's just say this is unprecedented. Nene: Shiiba-san and I are able to get along great, so you alps shouldn't fight either. Nanao: We made sure to set some ground rules so we wouldn't. Nanao: Oh well, it's fine. This is just a one-time thing. I'll trust you on this. Shuuji: Thank you, Souma-san. Nanao: Why are you the one thanking me? Shuuji: Oh, uh... Well... Tsumugi: Sorry to keep you all waiting! Tsumugi: Umm, this girl here is Akagi. Akagi: I am indeed Akagi. Although there is only one of you I have not yet met. Nene: It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Nanao's witch, Ayachi Nene. Akagi: The pleasure is all mine. Nene: ...Fascinating. She really does talk in a bit of an old-fashioned way. Nanao: Yeah, I know. I'm joining in too. Akagi: Well, you already know half of it anyway. There is hardly any reason for us to fight now. Nanao: I agree. That doesn't change how unnatural this meeting is, though. Akagi: That is only because you are such a stickler for the rules. But I shan't let that bother me this time. Akagi: Also, bring me a glass of milk. Tsumugi: Ah, umm. I'll go with a lemon tea. Nanao: Understood. Your orders will be coming right up. Akagi: So then... Akagi: You can talk more at ease. I don't like stiff talk. Shuuji: Okay, Akagi. Akagi: Good. Akagi: You... have magic in you, don't you? How very peculiar. No wonder you're allowed to accompany the two witches here. Shuuji: I don't really know much about that myself... Shuuji: But you're a little wrong about something. It's me who wants to know about Kizuki-san. Akagi: Do you know Chihoko? Shuuji: ...More like, I know someone who does. Akagi: Well, it's fine either way. What do you wish to know? Akagi: No idea. Shuuji: Wait, what?! Akagi: I simply thought that it would be better for me not to know. Shuuji: ...... Akagi: After all, the girl no longer knows anything about me either. Akagi: But that was part of the price she paid in order to see her wish fulfilled. That's how it is in our world. Nene: You mean... Tsumugi: A witch... Akagi: Indeed. You have it right. Akagi: She even lost her friend in order to have her wish fulfilled. Akagi: If I remember correctly... Her name was Inaba Meguru. Akagi: I don't understand much about friendship, but it's something humans value, is it not? And Chihoko has lost her only one. I have no idea where and how Chihoko or that Meguru girl are living their lives now... Meguru: ...... Touko: Hmm, it's so quiet when it's just two of us. Touko: I'm trying to liven things up, but I'm the only one talking. Meguru: ...I'm sorry. Touko: Ooh, you actually said something! Though, I'm still not sure how I'm supposed to make this more fun for us. Touko: But I'll try my best. You can talk to me about anything, and I won't say a word to anyone. Give it a shot! Meguru: ...... Meguru: W-Will do, then. Touko: Great! I'm ready! Meguru: Umm... Meguru: Don't you think this is really mean?! Touko: What is, exactly? Meguru: That they left us behind and went out with just the three of them! Touko: You wanted to go with them? Touko: You didn't want to stay here together with me? Meguru: That's not what I meant... Touko: Phew... I thought you hated me for a moment, there. Meguru: O-Of course I don't hate you! But... Touko: Yeah? You can go into more detail with me, if you'd like. Touko: You may feel better after talking to someone. Meguru: O-Okay... Umm... So... Touko: ...... Touko: You don't hate me, but...? Meguru: Ah! Right... Meguru: ...It's just so frustrating. Meguru: Why Nene-senpai and Tsumugi-senpai? Why didn't he ask me? Touko: Hmm... Meguru: And it seemed like the same thing happened yesterday. I just... Touko: Hmm... Can I ask you one question? Meguru: Ah, y-yeah. What is it? Touko: You're talking about Hoshina-kun, right? Meguru: ...? Well, yeah. Touko: Right, thought so. But... Touko: I don't think it was necessarily Hoshina-kun who invited Ayachi-san and Shiiba-san to go shopping today, you know. Meguru: ...... Meguru: Th-That may be so, but it's basically the same thing either way. Meguru: I'm still being left behind... Touko: Hmm... Well, I can't deny that. Touko: But, really... I see... Mufufu♪ Meguru: Wh-What's so funny? Touko: Nothing. I'm thinking about some tea. Do you want some? Meguru: ...Yeah. Touko: Gotcha. Just give me a few moments. Meguru: Ahhh... This is so frustrating. It's killing me! Touko: Oh gosh, how adorable. Touko: You know, Inaba-san, the way I see it... Meguru: Yeah...? Touko: You're the only one Hoshina-kun has eyes for. Meguru: ...... Meguru: Wh-What are you saying? There's no way that's true. Touko: Really? Meguru: Well, I mean... Meguru: It's not like Senpai is here with― Shuuji: %130;Meguru!! Meguru: Ah! Shuuji: What...? Touko: Oh, never mind me. Touko: You're in an awful hurry for someone who's just coming back from a shopping trip. Also, where are Ayachi-san and Shiiba-san? Shuuji: Oh, they're at... You know that place I brought you to before? Shuuji: They're there, at the Schwarze Katze. Touko: Oh yeah, that cafe. Their parfaits are wonderful. Shuuji: Anyway, Meguru! Meguru: Huh?! Y-Yeah! Shuuji: Sorry, I was in such a rush... I should have called you on the way here or asked Ayachi-san and Shiiba-san to do so... Shuuji: Anyway! That doesn't matter since you're still here. Meguru: U-Umm... Senpai? Shuuji: Would you come with me? Meguru: Huh? Touko: What about me, Hoshina-kun? Shuuji: Yeah, you too, please. You've done a lot to help us, so... I don't want to keep secrets anymore. Touko: Alrighty. I shall accompany you. Meguru: Umm, hey, so, Senpai! What is this― Shuuji: Sorry, Meguru. I need apologize in advance. Meguru: Huh?! Wh-What the heck is happening?! Shuuji: I'll explain later. Just come with me! Shuuji: We've found out what happened to Kizuki-san! Meguru: Huh? Chi-chan...? Nene: ―And that about covers it. Magic is real, and we are witches. Nene: You need to know these things, or else you'll find it hard to comprehend what we're about to talk about. Nene: I know this must be sudden, but please accept it for now. Meguru: O-Okay...? Meguru: Oh, well, umm... This doesn't seem like the kind of thing you can go around telling people willy-nilly, so umm, like... I don't really mind. Meguru: Actually, I feel kinda bad because I'm not sure I'm really following all this... Nene: I can explain any of the finer details you don't understand later. Nene: Togakushi-senpai, the same goes for you. Touko: Gotcha. I'm already grateful enough to be included in this.  Meguru: ...S-So, umm! Meguru: Senpai, you said you found out about Chi-chan... Shuuji: Yeah... We actually found someone who knows Kizuki-san. Shuuji: Akagi, can you take it from here? Akagi: Of course. Akagi: Rest assured, I'm not as young as I look. I am much older than you and Chihoko. Akagi: ...So you're Meguru, huh? My name is Akagi. I have heard a lot about you from Chihoko. Akagi: Mainly that you were her one and only friend. Her best friend. Meguru: ......!! Meguru: P-Please! Please tell me about Chi-chan! Akagi: In due time. Let us sit down, first. Meguru: Okay! Akagi: Also... Hey, I want my milk! Meguru: A-A glass of milk, please! Akagi: Haha... I had already ordered the milk, lass. Meguru: ...Huh? What the heck is \"milk glass\"? Shuuji: No, she said \"lass.\" She doesn't talk like a normal girl. Just think of her as your typical unaging loli. Meguru: ...Oh yeah! I see those in games and stuff all the time. Makes sense. Meguru: Ahaha... Milk is fine for me too. Akagi: Excellent choice. Matching drinks for the who share a bond with Chihoko. Akagi: Indeed, I can. I shall explain everything from the beginning. Meguru: What...? Akagi: That is, she was a witch. She had a wish that she wanted more than anything. Akagi: And so we formed a contract to fulfill that wish, thus making Chihoko my witch. Akagi: ...Meguru, do you understand everything so far? Meguru: Yeah... Meguru: I had no idea Chi-chan was a witch... Akagi: Your surprise is only natural. Witches tend not to talk about magic to those unrelated to our craft. Akagi: But it is different now; you have already been informed about us. Hence, I'm able to tell you now. It was necessary in order explain her current situation. Tsumugi: Actually I didn't know about that either. Tsumugi: You never told me that you made a contract with Chihoko-chan while you already had a contract with me... Shuuji: Oh, yeah... I guess that would've had to have been the case. Akagi: It's not as if I did anything wrong. There is no rule that says alps can only have one contractor. Nanao: Don't act like that's normal. We usually don't have more than one witch at a time. Shuuji: A-Anyway... Akagi, Shiiba-san was already your witch at the time? Akagi: Correct. Shuuji: Then why did you form a contract with Kizuki-san? Shuuji: Meguru, Kizuki-san used to live around here, right? Meguru: Y-Yeah. Chi-chan's place was about a 10-minute walk from my house. Akagi: I had no special reason. The girl vacationed in the town where I and Tsumugi were. She and I got to know each other, and then we exchanged a contract. That is all. Akagi: And so, for a time, I occasionally visited this town to check in on her. Akagi: But, well... because of that, there may have been a minor territorial dispute with that cat over there. Nanao: I don't want to hear it, bird. This is why I can't deal with winged creatures. Nanao: You put me through a lot, back then. Akagi: But I'll actually go crazy if I don't travel every once in a while. Maybe because I used to be a migratory bird. A cat wouldn't understand. Nanao: Oh well, it's all in the past. I don't want to start a fight in front of Nene. Akagi: Good. But we digress. Akagi: Getting back on topic... I assume you wish to know what happened to Chihoko after that? Meguru: Y-Yeah! I do! Akagi: Then I shall tell you. Where should I start... Akagi: Chihoko started gathering fragments shortly after becoming my witch. Akagi: But this was more difficult for her than most other witches. Akagi: After all, the emotional price she had to pay was an unusually harsh one... Akagi: And to make matters worse, I was only occasionally around. I couldn't offer my support around the clock.  Akagi: However, despite the obstacles set before her, she cleared them all and completed her magic. Akagi: She was just that desperate to complete her wish. Akagi: It shows how important that wish was to her. Meguru: What was it... that Chi-chan had wished for? Akagi: ...... Akagi: \"I want you to cure Megu-chan's disease.\" Meguru: ...... Meguru: I've never had any disease that― Akagi: I thought so. I had a feeling this would be the case. Akagi: Chihoko's departure must have been a tremendous shock that left you scarred. Akagi: But your body, on the other hand, seems as healthy as can be. Meguru: Wait! Wait a moment... I can't deny the part about the hole in my heart, but... Meguru: It wasn't me who was sickly, but Chi-chan... Akagi: ...While Chihoko was a quiet and slender girl, she didn't have any serious illnesses. Akagi: The tremendous shock must have jumbled up your memories.  Meguru: ...... Akagi: Or perhaps having your body cured overnight caused your brain to process it that way in order to keep things logically consistent. Akagi: Either way, it was you who had been suffering from an incurable illness. I had heard so from none other than Chihoko herself. Akagi: She told me that, due to your weak body, you stayed at home most days reading books.  Meguru: Ah... Akagi: She also told me that you often played video games together. You're quite good at them, are you not? Meguru: ...I-I guess. Akagi: But I also need to talk about the price she paid in order to see that wish fulfilled. Akagi: For that price is what had caused your separation. Meguru: Wh-What kind of price was it? Akagi: Listen well. The number of fragments required fulfill her wish was excessive, perhaps due to the strength of the disease you were afflicted with. Akagi: And on that same token, the emotional price she had to pay was unusually heavy. Akagi: For instance... Tsumugi. The price you're paying is also harsh, but the worst that can happen is some nausea, and you're otherwise fine as long as you dress in men's clothes, correct? Tsumugi: Y-Yeah, right. It's pretty harsh for me personally, but there's no danger involved or anything... Akagi: ...But it wasn't the same for Chihoko. Akagi: There was no way to fully avoid her price, and no loopholes to avoid triggering it. Akagi: It was the kind of price that came with permanent consequences. Consequences that would last even after her wish was fulfilled. Akagi: And that was the issue... Meguru: I can't take this anymore. Just tell me already! What happened to Chi-chan?! Akagi: The price she paid was... Akagi: Forgetting anyone she was close to. Meguru: Ah... Akagi: Don't complain to me. No one can predict the kind of price you'll get in advance. Akagi: That was simply the price she got. That's all there is to say. Meguru: Then, Chi-chan... Akagi: ...Needless to say, she was stunned when she first learned of her price. And at first, she blamed me heavily for it. Akagi: However, she quickly resolved herself. Akagi: In order to avoid causing needless distress, she proceeded to gradually distance herself and cut ties from everyone she knew. Akagi: Yet she couldn't bring herself to do the same for you. Akagi: Even though she would eventually forget you as well... she endured that fear and remained by your side. Meguru: B-But why... Why would she go so far? Akagi: Well, because you were her best friend. Meguru: ...... Akagi: She told me this... Akagi: \"Megu-chan is actually a very cheerful girl. She's a wonderful person that anyone could come to love.\" Akagi: \"I'm really bad at making friends and only have Megu-chan, but deep down, she's different.\" Akagi: \"And to think she told me I'm her one and only friend. Her best friend in the whole world.\" Akagi: \"She said that as long as she has me, she doesn't need other friends.\" Akagi: \"Hearing that made me so very happy...\" Akagi: \"And so... I want to thank her.\" Akagi: \"I want to repay Megu-chan somehow.\" Akagi: \"I want to make the friend I'm so proud of be able to cheerfully run around outside.\" Akagi: \"I want her to be loved by everyone in her class.\" Akagi: \"Even if I end up forgetting about her...\" Akagi: \"...I want to help her become able to face life without me.\" Akagi: \"And to achieve that, I want to complete our contract and cure her disease.\" Meguru: ...... Akagi: The first to be forgotten was her parents. Akagi: They were beyond startled. They talked about medical examinations and surgery. They eventually decided to move somewhere far away for their daughter to live. Akagi: And then... At the very end, she even forgot her precious friend. The one her magic was meant for in the first place. Akagi: As a result... you ended up suddenly losing your best friend. Akagi: The lack of farewells was only natural. Chihoko had lost her memory of you by that point. Akagi: That was when her parents cut all ties to their life here and moved away with their daughter... Tsumugi: So that's what happened... Nene: That's why the school didn't have any records... Touko: ...You really don't where she went? Not even you? Akagi: No. I have no idea where she is living currently. Akagi: It is probably for the best to not look for her. I have no intention of doing that either. Akagi: It would likely only bother her and her parents and possibly even cause her undue stress. Meguru: So then... She's just... Shuuji: Kh... Akagi: Meguru, do you understand what that means? Meguru: Well... Meguru: Chi-chan cured my disease, but in exchange, she doesn't remember me anymore... Akagi: That's right! But to do that... Akagi: ...She saw it through to the end, even after she had already forgotten about you. Meguru: Ahh...! Akagi: Even I was surprised by that. Akagi: She really didn't remember you anymore. Akagi: But she told me that she could tell how important this was to do. Akagi: That by doing this, she was sure her wish would come true. Akagi: Despite the fact that she didn't even remember who that wish would cure anymore. Akagi: At the very end, she even forgot me. And yet, she still saw it through. Akagi: ...Chihoko was an amazing human. She said that she wanted this to serve as her farewell. Akagi: She may have forgotten you... But the magic she brought to life in exchange was literally Chihoko herself. Akagi: And that magic is now living on in your heart, Meguru. Meguru: Ah, aah... Meguru: Yeah...! Meguru: Senpai...! Akagi: That's right. Meguru: Thanks to Chi-chan... I... Meguru: I never left her thoughts... Meguru: My good health was Chi-chan's last gift to me. Meguru: It's Chi-chan's memories that are giving me life! Meguru: I...! I had never lost my best friend! Meguru: I haven't been able to do anything for Chi-chan! Meguru: It's so painful... I don't know how I can possibly repay Chi-chan for all she's done. Akagi: ...Let me tell you something here and now, Meguru. Akagi: I'm sure you were but an empty shell after losing Chihoko. Meguru: Y-Yeah... Akagi: But the girl I see today isn't just healthy. Akagi: She's surrounded by many friends. You're loved dearly. Everyone you see here now is giving you their full support, are they not? Meguru: Akagi... Akagi: Furthermore, I was honestly taken aback when I saw you today. Akagi: You are nothing like the child Chihoko described to me. You have a serious sense of fashion and, how should I put this... You're a real looker. Meguru: I'm dressing like this because... Akagi: You needn't say it. Both I and Chihoko know. Akagi: You recovered and got back on your feet because you knew that you couldn't let things continue as they had been, am I right? Meguru: Ah... Akagi: I am positive that was what Chihoko was truly wishing for. So rest assured! Akagi: For you have fulfilled Chihoko's wish as well. Meguru: ～～～～! Meguru: Waaaaaaah! Meguru: I'll do my best! I'll live strong for you! Meguru: You don't have to worry anymore... I'm strong now. Meguru: Wahh... Waaaaaah! "

            "Shuuji: So we should go with a more straightforward approach, basically?  Touko: Mhm. Honesty and frankness can create quite the impact. Shuuji: I had this vague impression in my mind that rosy, romantic talk was the way to go.  Meguru: I really feel like that differs for everyone. In Hisashima-sensei's case, well... She'd probably just think you're stupid. Tsumugi: Yeah. I probably don't know her as well as you guys, but I can just picture her yelling \"Get to the damn point already.\" Shuuji: Ahh... Yeah. That's definitely in-line with her personality.  Shuuji: I see. Nene: Yes, if you would. Meguru: So, just a question, but is there any sort of breakthrough idea he's gonna get from these? Touko: Hmm, I guess that depends on what positive qualities he has... Touko: Hoshina-kun, you, Ayachi-san and Shiiba-san are in his class, right?  Tsumugi: I am, but I don't know him very well yet... Tsumugi: But from what I've seen, he seems funny and pretty cool.  Nene: He also seems quite proactive. Oh, and he's always smiling.  Shuuji: Yeah, he has a lot of guts at times, surprisingly. Kinda like with this, when he makes up his mind to do something, he gives it 110\\%.  Touko: If you just look at it on paper, it could work out, but... Meguru: The problem being she answered question number 11 with \"Shouldn't happen.\" That seems like a preeetty big hurdle to overcome... Shuuji: Well, it's up to Kaidou to make up his mind after seeing it. I'll go tell him the results in a bit. Tsumugi: So are we basically done for today, then?  Touko: Ah, one thing before that. I need to collect everyone's surveys. Have you guys all filled them out?  Meguru: Uh-huh. Here's mine.  Tsumugi: I did mine too. Just promise me you won't look. I'm a little embarrassed.  Touko: I won't, I won't. There'd be no point in making it anonymous if I did. Just give it to me face down and I'll shuffle it in with the rest. Shuuji: Ahh, crap... Sorry. I forgot to do mine... Touko: Come on now, Hoshina-kun. You gotta keep your promises. Nene: I'm sorry... I actually forgot to do mine too. Touko: Even you did? Meguru: Wow. You never make silly mistakes like forgetting to do something.  Touko: Do you have the surveys on you? Shuuji: Sorry. I think I left mine on my table at home... Touko: Well, nothing we can do about that. Just make sure you get them to me tomorrow after school and I'll take them to the Newspaper Club with the rest. Shuuji: Okay. Nene: Thank you.  Shuuji: Also, she basically lives the life of a single, middle-aged man. Here's a basic summary of her answers.  Shuuji: So do you know what you're gonna do? Hideaki: Nope. But now that I got this information, I'm gonna give it some serious thought. Hideaki: Looking at this stuff, though... Shit, how do I confess? What approach is gonna do me the best... Hideaki: I just hope I find something I can use as a starting point.  Shuuji: Look, you don't have to force yourself to go through with it now because of our help.  Hideaki: Besides, getting it off my chest helped out a lot. I'll be able to think about everything calmly.  Shuuji: Glad to hear. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Just curious... But what exactly does it feel like to love someone so much you feel like you're going crazy?  Hideaki: Well... Didn't I already tell you? You think about that person 24/7 and can't help it.  Hideaki: You want to talk with her, you follow her with your eyes whenever you're around her. You try and think of ways to spend time with her and get jealous over the dumbest things... Hideaki: Frankly speaking, it's all shit that seems pretty creepy when you stop and think about it.  Hideaki: But no matter how weird you think it is, you can't do a damn thing to stop it. When you see her having fun or smiling, it's the sweetest feeling in the world. Shuuji: You find yourself staring at her when she smiles?  Hideaki: Oh, you betcha. Happens all the time.  Shuuji: What about dreams? Do you dream about her too? Hideaki: Occasionally. That happens when you're thinking about her 'round the clock. Awake or asleep doesn't matter.  Shuuji: Hmm... I see... Shuuji: No, no, it's nothing! Hideaki: You're a goddamn open book, I swear.  Shuuji: ...... Hideaki: No need to hide it, man. Nothing embarrassing about being in love with Ayachi-san. Anybody would with a girl that cute around.  Shuuji: It's not like I'm embarrassed about― Shuuji: Wait, how did you narrow it down to Ayachi-san? Hideaki: Oh-ho, what is that I hear? Do you dare try to deny it?  Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: ...Was it that obvious? Hideaki: Definitely. I'd say anyone who knows you a bit better would notice immediately. Shuuji: Well... I guess she doesn't mind me. Shuuji: Well, a lot's happened.  Hideaki: So are you gonna tell her? I can tell you, you're sure as hell not gonna get anywhere if you just keep wracking your brains over it.  Shuuji: ...Hmm. Shuuji: What do you think I should do? Hideaki: That's for you to decide, man. It's your life, not mine.  Shuuji: That's what you say after egging me on to confess? Hideaki: Hahahaha. What I'm basically saying is, give it some serious thought.  Shuuji: Yeah. Hideaki: Oh right. Would you mind letting me return the key? Shuuji: Sure, fine by me... Do you want to talk to Sensei? Hideaki: You're not supposed to say it, man.  Hideaki: We're here to return the key. Kanae: Hm? Ah, right. Thanks. Kanae: But seriously, just what were you two guys doing in there two days in a row? Shuuji: Completely normal things.  Hideaki: Don't go spreading any funny rumors about us now, Kanae-chan. Kanae: Don't call me Kanae-chan. And especially not in the faculty room.

Shuuji: Hmm... Meguru: But like I just mentioned, Nene-senpai always seems kinda distant, you know? So it's hard to just up and ask her. Meguru: What if she went all, \"You want me to eat lunch with you? Why would I do that?\" I'd die from shock. Shuuji: ...Yeah, that's tough. Shuuji: Okay. I'll do what I can. Meguru: ...!! Shuuji: Err, I think it's a bit early to be thanking me. Meguru: Whatcha mean? Shuuji: While I'd love to help you, I'm not actually sure how I got so close to Ayachi-san. Shuuji: So I don't have a clue where to start. Meguru: What?! Meguru: Th-That's not true! You're like super close! You've even been communicating with eye contact alone! Meguru: That's the whole reason I said this is unfair! Shuuji: Well, I'm glad you think so, but I dunno what to do... Shuuji: Like you said earlier, there's an inherent difference in how we can interact with her since I'm a guy and you're a girl. I doubt my approach would work for you. Meguru: You got close with her in a way only a guy can...? Meguru: W-Wait! Is that why you understand each other so well?! I mean, like, your relationship has gotten ph-ph-physical?! Shuuji: Whoa, whoa! Hold on! You're way off-base! Why are you taking things in that direction?! Meguru: Don't put this on me! You're the one who made it sound like that! Shuuji: I didn't! That was all you! Anyway, just calm down. Let's get some drinks at the vending machine over there. Shuuji: That's what I want to say... *sip* Anyway, that was just a misunderstanding on your part.  Meguru: Yeah, I know. There's no way that'd be true now that I think about it. Shuuji: Would've been nice if you thought that through sooner... Would have saved me some money on the drinks. Meguru: Ah, speaking of, is the milk tea you got any good? I had a hard time deciding between that and this coffee. Shuuji: I'd say it's better than the kind they have at school. Meguru: Hmm... Maybe I should've went with the milk tea instead. Shuuji: Want a taste? Meguru: Of course not! That would be an... i-i-indirect kiss! Shuuji: Oh... Y-Yeah, I guess so. Meguru: Geez, why are you always like this? There's no way a dolt like you could get close with Nene-senpai! Shuuji: Isn't that different from what you said earlier? Meguru: ...So please tell me how you got so close to her while being such a dolt. Shuuji: Err, like I said, I have no idea. Meguru: You are no help at all... Shuuji: Oh, give me a break. Let me think... Meguru: I won't drink that even if you wipe the rim clean. Shuuji: Forget about that already. What I'm saying is... Shuuji: Why not just go and visit Ayachi-san right now? Meguru: ...... Shuuji: And then when you're there, suggest staying the night. Meguru: ...Y-You mean, just me? Shuuji: Of course. You want to get closer to her, right? Meguru: N-No way! Shuuji: You mean you don't want to get closer to her?! Meguru: No, I do! But you want me to stay the night with her?! Meguru: Visiting her by myself would be hard enough for me... Shuuji: And yet you have no qualms hanging out at my place... Meguru: Th-That's because it's you. Meguru: R-Right. Meguru: But, umm, the idea itself is good. Sleeping over at Nene-senpai's place is like a dream for me. Shuuji: Okay, then with that goal in mind, how about you work towards getting closer to her starting tomorrow? Meguru: Ugh... Can I really do this? Shuuji: Well, how about you come and stay over at my place as practice? Meguru: AS IF!! Shuuji: Well, with that settled, let's pick this back up tomorrow. Meguru: O-Okay. See you tomorrow. Meguru: Umm... Thank you, Senpai. Shuuji: You can show your thanks by staying the night at my place. Meguru: What?! Are you serious?! Are you in super-perv Senpai mode right now?! Are you after me or something?! Shuuji: Nah, just kidding. Meguru: You've got a real messed up sense of humor... Taichi: Okay. Take care. Shuuji: ...Good morning. Meguru: Yeah! I figured you'd eventually pass by here. Shuuji: ...Why, though? Meguru: Hey! What kind of reaction is that? Meguru: Didn't you tell me you'd help me yesterday? Shuuji: Oh yeah, I guess that makes sense... Shuuji: Sorry. I was just a little taken aback. Meguru: ...Senpai? Shuuji: Oh, it's nothing. Let's walk while we talk. Meguru: Yeah! Roger that. Shuuji: We'll end up at school in no time if we follow my regular route though. Shuuji: So at the risk of sounding boring, let's take the same detour as yesterday. Shuuji: Should we not have taken a detour? Meguru: No, that was actually a good idea. Meguru: ...It just feels strange heading to school with you. Shuuji: Even though you were waiting to ambush me... Meguru: I-I know. And did you have to put it like that? You make me sound like a bad guy! Shuuji: Anyway, if you have no problem with the detour, then let's get down to business. Shuuji: We need to talk about how you should get closer to Ayachi-san. Meguru: Y-Yeah. Shuuji: So, to make sure, is the goal still being able to sleep over at her place? Meguru: Yeah, we can go with that. Meguru: I kinda got really flustered yesterday, but after thinking about it calmly, it doesn't seem too hard to do. Shuuji: If it's that easy, then can't you do this without my help? Meguru: Th-That's not how I meant it! You can't back out now! You already promised me you'd help! Meguru: Good! Meguru: You know, for how cold you seem, you're surprisingly nice. Shuuji: How am I supposed to take that? Meguru: As a compliment. Shuuji: O-Okay, thanks... Anyhow... Shuuji: The way I see it, getting used to interacting with her is the only way. Meguru: Right. I agree with that. Shuuji: And so, your first step should be― Meguru: Ne... N-N-Nene-senpai! Meguru: Good mornifsh! Nene: It's unusual to see you here in the morning. Meguru: Y-Yesh. Tru dat! Nene: ......?? Meguru: Not at all! Just saying good morninf! Meguru: Hoshina-senpai invited me, so I figured I would swing by... Nene: Okay...? Meguru: Helloha! Nene: ...Yes. Helloha to you as well. Meguru: ...... Nene: ...... "

Meguru: You know, way more people are stopping by for fortune telling than consultations lately. Nene: Yeah, that's true. Tsumugi: Do you get these stretches of no consultations often? Nene: Yeah, we do. A lot of people don't have any serious issues; they just want a push on the back. Tsumugi: Oh, yeah. You're right. I bet that a lot of the time, they've already made up their mind and just want some encouragement. Shuuji: This is probably a good thing, considering the time of the year. Nene: Yeah, midterms are coming up soon. A lot of students probably want to focus on studying, even if they have other things to worry about. Shuuji: I gotta study up myself. Meguru: Wow, Senpai, you take your studying pretty seriously, huh? Shuuji: Well, I didn't have anything else to do other than studying before joining the OC. Tsumugi: You must have pretty good grades then. Shuuji: Nothing worth bragging about. I'm just above average, I'd say. Meguru: ...Tch. I always figured you were a slacker who intentionally bombed your tests to get the easier retakes. Shuuji: Wow. How rude. Tsumugi: Are your grades good, Meguru-chan? Meguru: ...Please don't ask. I don't want to think about it. Tsumugi: That reaction tells me everything. You really need to study more. Meguru: Ugh... Shuuji: All club activities will be put on a mandatory break starting next week as midterms near. You should have plenty of time to study.  Meguru: I wouldn't be having this problem in the first place if all I needed was time to study. Shuuji: I know where you're coming from, but you're only hurting yourself by not studying. Meguru: Stop it! You're making way too much sense! I don't wanna hear it! Tsumugi: Ahaha, you can't keep making excuses for yourself. Shuuji: Huh, Koshiji-san? Koshiji: Hi there. Long time no see. Shuuji: Oh, yeah, it's been a while. Thanks for back then. And congrats on becoming president. Koshiji: Ahh... Yeah. I was hoping to forget that, so thanks a lot for bringing it up again.

I was off pitch because of my nervousness... Meguru: No, you were great! You got the audience fired up like crazy! Nene: I'm glad you think that way, but really, that's thanks to the whole band. Tsumugi: Kaidou-kun, Kariya-san, and Hoshina-kun were all so amazing! Wakana: Th-Thanks... It's kinda embarrassing to hear you say so. Wakana: I mean, I made a lot of mistakes... Touko: Sure, it's important to try to minimize mistakes, but your main goal was to fire up the party. I don't think you have anything to worry about there. Shuuji: Thank you. I'll take your word for it and be happy about the praise. Meguru: Good work out there, Senpai. Shuuji: Oh, thanks, Inaba-san. How'd you like it? Meguru: You kinda sucked! Shuuji: You don't pull any punches, do you? Wakana: Thanks a lot for today, Hoshina, Kaidou. And you too, Ayachi-san. Nene: Oh, no, I'm just happy to be of help. Hideaki: You're more than welcome. I had a lot of fun too. Shuuji: I should be thanking you, Kariya. Thanks for giving this your all despite how sudden it was. Wakana: No, I needed to do this and I'm glad I did. I'll always look back on this fondly. Shuuji: Yeah, me too. Meguru: Wait a minute... Why are you talking like you won't perform anymore? Meguru: I really would've liked to hear you play again. Shuuji: That's flattering, but I couldn't possibly. I'm just not cut out for this kind of thing. Hideaki: ...Small parties are great, because the bar is set so low. Shuuji: I'm guessing performing at a club is a lot tougher? Hideaki: Well... honestly, those with the most devoted fans win. Even if you really suck, you're set as long as have some followers. Shuuji: That so? Hideaki: Actually, it's not unusual to see bands who are even worse than we were. Shuuji: Huh? There are bands THAT bad? Hideaki: Sometimes, yeah. And it's also common to never draw a good crowd no matter how good you are. Hideaki: So yeah, it's honestly not that unlikely for us to find some success if we tried playing at a club. Though, your share of the ticket revenue is depressingly low. Shuuji: Well, I definitely have no plans to continue. Meguru: What, seriously? I'd come to watch you play. Shuuji: Again, I'm flattered, but I'd seriously die if I kept up the lifestyle I had the last couple weeks. My left hand is killing me, and I haven't slept well in ages. Shuuji: I also wouldn't be able to attend the club if I were to keep practicing. Meguru: ...You sure take the club pretty seriously. Shuuji: Of course. Shuuji: Helping people one by one like in the OC suits me better. Meguru: Ah, yeah, I know what you mean. Meguru: It's more fun when you're face to face with someone and can see their reactions. The same goes for when you're playing MonHun together! Shuuji: Why do you always compare everything to... Well, I guess you have a point, actually. Meguru: Oh, that's right. Did you hear about the new event? Shuuji: Huh? No, I haven't. Shuuji: Yeah, sure thing. Meguru: Just leave it all to me. It's a monster that'd be tough for a spear user like you, so I'll help you out whenever you want! Shuuji: Really? I'd appreciate it! Shuuji: Though, aren't you going a little out of the way for me? Meguru: Huh?! Oh, well, you see... Um... I was completely useless, right? Meguru: I just sat around being tutored during midterms, and I didn't do anything special for the party like you... Shuuji: I don't think that's true. Meguru: At the end of the day, I'm only good at games... That doesn't make me very helpful, though. Shuuji: Don't be so hard on yourself. I heard you did an awesome job baking the pudding and cookies. Meguru: Anyone could do that. Shuuji: Come to think of it, I haven't tried those yet. Meguru: Yeah, there's some over here. Only the cookies, though... Wanna try one? Shuuji: You bet. Now that my mind is off the performance, I'm pretty hungry. Meguru: Okay... Here you go. They're nothing special, though. Just some perfectly ordinary pumpkin cookies. Shuuji: Let's see. Meguru: Yeah, I made them myself. Shuuji: Wow, color me impressed. That tasted amazing. Meguru: ...You're just flattering me, aren't you? Shuuji: I'm not. I really liked it. Can I have another? Meguru: Of course you can... Shuuji: Thanks... *munch* *munch* Shuuji: Mmm, yeah, these really are good. I love 'em. Meguru: ...... Shuuji: Hey... What's with that look? Meguru: Well, it's suspicious how enthusiastic you are about them. Shuuji: You're being too cynical. You should trust me more. Shuuji: I'm obviously not lying. Just look at how many of the guests are eating these cookies. Meguru: Yeah, I guess. Shuuji: See? You really are helpful. Shuuji: At the very least, I'm really happy I could grab a snack. I'm exhausted after that performance, so the sugar will help a lot. Meguru: Y-You mean it? Th-Thank you. Meguru: I-It's kinda embarrassing to be praised so lavishly... Oh, want some pudding too? I'll get you some. Hold put! Shuuji: Ah, wait― Meguru: Here you go, Senpai. Hope I didn't keep you waiting. Shuuji: I love it. I wouldn't mind you making it for me again sometime. Meguru: Hehe... Shuuji: You seem pleased. Meguru: Huh? Oh, ahaha... I mean, who doesn't like being praised? Shuuji: I'm being serious, by the way. Just trust me and be happy. Meguru: ...Okay. I'll believe you. Meguru: And i-if I feel like it... maybe I'll make more cookies for you sometime. Shuuji: Ooh, I'll be looking forward to it. Shuuji: Alright, then. We threw this party; now it's time to enjoy it.

Yeah. I didn't expect it at all. Nene: I'm very sorry. I should have informed Hoshina-kun beforehand. Tsumugi: You don't need to apologize. There was no time for that since it was just after P.E., right? So... No one is to blame there. Tsumugi: Really, don't worry about it. Actually, umm... Rather than you apologizing, I would like you to forget. Tsumugi: L-Let's just say you never saw anything. Shuuji: Got it. I haven't seen anything. Shuuji: I didn't see you in your underwear at all.

Why would you go in for an extra blow in this situation, super-perv Senpai?! Shuuji: Yeah, I have no excuse. Shuuji: I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Meguru: But why were you changing in the clubroom, anyway, Shiiba-senpai? Nene: I suggested doing so because it looked like she was embarrassed by changing in the locker room. Nene: I already had the key on me, so the clubroom was the first room I thought of for changing in... Shuuji: Why was it embarrassing? You're all girls. Tsumugi: Well, umm... You see, I really surprised everyone when I entered the locker room to change before P.E. Tsumugi: And then actually changing was really embarrassing too. Shuuji: Because everyone was already looking at you? Tsumugi: Partly, yeah... But also, everyone else was able to skillfully change without fully taking off their uniforms. Shuuji: Without taking off their uniforms...? Like how elementary schoolchildren change into swimsuits? Tsumugi: Yeah, right... Shuuji: Girls do that even though it's only other girls in the locker room? Tsumugi: Yeah, they do. Shuuji: Is that common? Nene: Yes. Even when it's with other girls, it's still uncomfortable to be seen half-naked. Meguru: Right. And there's stuff like not wanting to be laughed at for the underwear you're wearing. Shuuji: Is that so? Nene: There's a lot to consider with underwear, such as the comfort level. You tend to wear your most comfortable underwear more often... Nene: But they wear out quickly when you do that, so... Ah! Don't make me say weird stuff like that! Shuuji: No! You did this yourself! Don't blame me for blurting that out on your own! Shuuji: I don't want to know about that kind of stuff, anyway! Tsumugi: But anyway, I can't get around taking off my pants, right? Which is why, umm... I can't avoid letting everyone see my underwear. Shuuji: Well... If you don't take measures beforehand, that's how it turns out, yeah. Tsumugi: Besides, everyone kept looking at me.  Tsumugi: \"She's wearing a boy's uniform, but what about her underwear? Is she wearing a chest binder?\" You could tell that's what everyone was thinking. Shuuji: Yeah, I can see that. Meguru: To be perfectly honest, I've been a little curious about that myself. Tsumugi: I-I'm wearing perfectly normal girls' underwear! I can't show you, though... Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Oh, uh, absolutely nothing! Meguru: But despite that, you ended up experiencing something even more embarrassing... Nene: But you can't keep changing in the clubroom, so we need to come up with another solution. Tsumugi: Right... *sigh* Meguru: Heh heh heh. This is my time to shine. Nene: What do you mean? Meguru: Remember how we talked about changing her hairstyle yesterday? Shuuji: Oh yeah... You mean how changing her hairstyle could change everyone's impression of her? Meguru: Exactly. So, I've already gotten everything ready! Tsumugi: R-Really?! Meguru: Yep! So please, sit down here! I'll do your hair for you. Tsumugi: U-Umm... Okay, thank you so much. Meguru: ～～～♪ Meguru: You have nothing to be embarrassed about! I'm so jealous of your glossy hair. I wish I had hair like that. Tsumugi: You shouldn't worry about that. I mean, your fluffy hair is totally cute. Meguru: I'd rather have it be glossy and silky. But really, your hair is just fantastic～ Nene: Is it that amazing? Meguru: Go ahead and touch it yourself, Nene-senpai. Nene: Okay then, if Shiiba-san doesn't mind... Nene: Wow, it really is smooth. How nice... I'm getting a little jealous myself. Meguru: Oh, please. You have no right to be jealous. Just look at how silky your hair is! Nene: Ah, d-don't! It tickles when you touch me there. Meguru: How interesting... Your nape is ticklish, is it? Tsumugi: Fueh? Ah, hey, sto―! Ahhnn! Shuuji: ...... Tsumugi: Geez, knock it off～ Nene: Inaba-san, no means no, okay? Meguru: 'Kay! Shiiba-senpai, sorry about that. I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable. Shuuji: Is it really that smooth? Mind if I― Nene, Meguru, Tsumugi: ...... Shuuji: Ah, right. Of course I can't. I just thought it wouldn't hurt to ask. Don't mind me. Tsumugi: Y-Yeah, okay. Nene: Shiiba-san, are there any specific hairstyles that you would like? Tsumugi: Let me think... Not really. Anything cute will do! Meguru: Anything cute? Roger that! Meguru: Then, I guess I'll go with this accessory... Or maybe this one? Which would look better? Nene: If she wants to look cute, then I would say this one here, no? Meguru: Ah! That one is great! Way to go, Nene-senpai! You have great taste. Tsumugi: U-Umm, I'm not really used to this kind of thing, so I'm kind of uneasy about it. Just take it slow, okay? Take it slow. Meguru: I'm not sure what there is to be uneasy about... But if that's what you want, then let's just go for a cute hairstyle with no accessories. Meguru: ～～～♪ Nene: A braided hairstyle? Like, in pigtails?  Meguru: Right. Some manga have pretty boys who wear braids, so I think it's worth a try. Tsumugi: I've never braided my hair before. Meguru: Don't worry about it. Your hair is long enough, and it's pretty easy to do. Meguru: Just divide the hair into three strands, cross one outer strand over the middle one, then the other, and... Meguru: Voila! What do you think, Shiiba-senpai? Tsumugi: Umm... Ah, good. It looks like I'm fine! "

            "Nanao: Yes, in all kinds of ways. You would never expect an alp to tell anyone about their contractors, especially not in the presence of another alp. Nanao: Not to mention how both alps are willingly partaking in this. And also... Well, let's just say this is unprecedented. Nene: Shiiba-san and I are able to get along great, so you alps shouldn't fight either. Nanao: We made sure to set some ground rules so we wouldn't. Nanao: Oh well, it's fine. This is just a one-time thing. I'll trust you on this. Shuuji: Thank you, Souma-san. Nanao: Why are you the one thanking me? Shuuji: Oh, uh... Well... Tsumugi: Sorry to keep you all waiting! Tsumugi: Umm, this girl here is Akagi. Akagi: I am indeed Akagi. Although there is only one of you I have not yet met. Nene: It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Nanao's witch, Ayachi Nene. Akagi: The pleasure is all mine. Nene: ...Fascinating. She really does talk in a bit of an old-fashioned way. Nanao: Yeah, I know. I'm joining in too. Akagi: Well, you already know half of it anyway. There is hardly any reason for us to fight now. Nanao: I agree. That doesn't change how unnatural this meeting is, though. Akagi: That is only because you are such a stickler for the rules. But I shan't let that bother me this time. Akagi: Also, bring me a glass of milk. Tsumugi: Ah, umm. I'll go with a lemon tea. Nanao: Understood. Your orders will be coming right up. Akagi: So then... Akagi: You can talk more at ease. I don't like stiff talk. Shuuji: Okay, Akagi. Akagi: Good. Akagi: You... have magic in you, don't you? How very peculiar. No wonder you're allowed to accompany the two witches here. Shuuji: I don't really know much about that myself... Shuuji: But you're a little wrong about something. It's me who wants to know about Kizuki-san. Akagi: Do you know Chihoko? Shuuji: ...More like, I know someone who does. Akagi: Well, it's fine either way. What do you wish to know? Akagi: No idea. Shuuji: Wait, what?! Akagi: I simply thought that it would be better for me not to know. Shuuji: ...... Akagi: After all, the girl no longer knows anything about me either. Akagi: But that was part of the price she paid in order to see her wish fulfilled. That's how it is in our world. Nene: You mean... Tsumugi: A witch... Akagi: Indeed. You have it right. Akagi: She even lost her friend in order to have her wish fulfilled. Akagi: If I remember correctly... Her name was Inaba Meguru. Akagi: I don't understand much about friendship, but it's something humans value, is it not? And Chihoko has lost her only one. I have no idea where and how Chihoko or that Meguru girl are living their lives now... Meguru: ...... Touko: Hmm, it's so quiet when it's just two of us. Touko: I'm trying to liven things up, but I'm the only one talking. Meguru: ...I'm sorry. Touko: Ooh, you actually said something! Though, I'm still not sure how I'm supposed to make this more fun for us. Touko: But I'll try my best. You can talk to me about anything, and I won't say a word to anyone. Give it a shot! Meguru: ...... Meguru: W-Will do, then. Touko: Great! I'm ready! Meguru: Umm... Meguru: Don't you think this is really mean?! Touko: What is, exactly? Meguru: That they left us behind and went out with just the three of them! Touko: You wanted to go with them? Touko: You didn't want to stay here together with me? Meguru: That's not what I meant... Touko: Phew... I thought you hated me for a moment, there. Meguru: O-Of course I don't hate you! But... Touko: Yeah? You can go into more detail with me, if you'd like. Touko: You may feel better after talking to someone. Meguru: O-Okay... Umm... So... Touko: ...... Touko: You don't hate me, but...? Meguru: Ah! Right... Meguru: ...It's just so frustrating. Meguru: Why Nene-senpai and Tsumugi-senpai? Why didn't he ask me? Touko: Hmm... Meguru: And it seemed like the same thing happened yesterday. I just... Touko: Hmm... Can I ask you one question? Meguru: Ah, y-yeah. What is it? Touko: You're talking about Hoshina-kun, right? Meguru: ...? Well, yeah. Touko: Right, thought so. But... Touko: I don't think it was necessarily Hoshina-kun who invited Ayachi-san and Shiiba-san to go shopping today, you know. Meguru: ...... Meguru: Th-That may be so, but it's basically the same thing either way. Meguru: I'm still being left behind... Touko: Hmm... Well, I can't deny that. Touko: But, really... I see... Mufufu♪ Meguru: Wh-What's so funny? Touko: Nothing. I'm thinking about some tea. Do you want some? Meguru: ...Yeah. Touko: Gotcha. Just give me a few moments. Meguru: Ahhh... This is so frustrating. It's killing me! Touko: Oh gosh, how adorable. Touko: You know, Inaba-san, the way I see it... Meguru: Yeah...? Touko: You're the only one Hoshina-kun has eyes for. Meguru: ...... Meguru: Wh-What are you saying? There's no way that's true. Touko: Really? Meguru: Well, I mean... Meguru: It's not like Senpai is here with― Shuuji: %130;Meguru!! Meguru: Ah! Shuuji: What...? Touko: Oh, never mind me. Touko: You're in an awful hurry for someone who's just coming back from a shopping trip. Also, where are Ayachi-san and Shiiba-san? Shuuji: Oh, they're at... You know that place I brought you to before? Shuuji: They're there, at the Schwarze Katze. Touko: Oh yeah, that cafe. Their parfaits are wonderful. Shuuji: Anyway, Meguru! Meguru: Huh?! Y-Yeah! Shuuji: Sorry, I was in such a rush... I should have called you on the way here or asked Ayachi-san and Shiiba-san to do so... Shuuji: Anyway! That doesn't matter since you're still here. Meguru: U-Umm... Senpai? Shuuji: Would you come with me? Meguru: Huh? Touko: What about me, Hoshina-kun? Shuuji: Yeah, you too, please. You've done a lot to help us, so... I don't want to keep secrets anymore. Touko: Alrighty. I shall accompany you. Meguru: Umm, hey, so, Senpai! What is this― Shuuji: Sorry, Meguru. I need apologize in advance. Meguru: Huh?! Wh-What the heck is happening?! Shuuji: I'll explain later. Just come with me! Shuuji: We've found out what happened to Kizuki-san! Meguru: Huh? Chi-chan...? Nene: ―And that about covers it. Magic is real, and we are witches. Nene: You need to know these things, or else you'll find it hard to comprehend what we're about to talk about. Nene: I know this must be sudden, but please accept it for now. Meguru: O-Okay...? Meguru: Oh, well, umm... This doesn't seem like the kind of thing you can go around telling people willy-nilly, so umm, like... I don't really mind. Meguru: Actually, I feel kinda bad because I'm not sure I'm really following all this... Nene: I can explain any of the finer details you don't understand later. Nene: Togakushi-senpai, the same goes for you. Touko: Gotcha. I'm already grateful enough to be included in this.  Meguru: ...S-So, umm! Meguru: Senpai, you said you found out about Chi-chan... Shuuji: Yeah... We actually found someone who knows Kizuki-san. Shuuji: Akagi, can you take it from here? Akagi: Of course. Akagi: Rest assured, I'm not as young as I look. I am much older than you and Chihoko. Akagi: ...So you're Meguru, huh? My name is Akagi. I have heard a lot about you from Chihoko. Akagi: Mainly that you were her one and only friend. Her best friend. Meguru: ......!! Meguru: P-Please! Please tell me about Chi-chan! Akagi: In due time. Let us sit down, first. Meguru: Okay! Akagi: Also... Hey, I want my milk! Meguru: A-A glass of milk, please! Akagi: Haha... I had already ordered the milk, lass. Meguru: ...Huh? What the heck is \"milk glass\"? Shuuji: No, she said \"lass.\" She doesn't talk like a normal girl. Just think of her as your typical unaging loli. Meguru: ...Oh yeah! I see those in games and stuff all the time. Makes sense. Meguru: Ahaha... Milk is fine for me too. Akagi: Excellent choice. Matching drinks for the who share a bond with Chihoko. Akagi: Indeed, I can. I shall explain everything from the beginning. Meguru: What...? Akagi: That is, she was a witch. She had a wish that she wanted more than anything. Akagi: And so we formed a contract to fulfill that wish, thus making Chihoko my witch. Akagi: ...Meguru, do you understand everything so far? Meguru: Yeah... Meguru: I had no idea Chi-chan was a witch... Akagi: Your surprise is only natural. Witches tend not to talk about magic to those unrelated to our craft. Akagi: But it is different now; you have already been informed about us. Hence, I'm able to tell you now. It was necessary in order explain her current situation. Tsumugi: Actually I didn't know about that either. Tsumugi: You never told me that you made a contract with Chihoko-chan while you already had a contract with me... Shuuji: Oh, yeah... I guess that would've had to have been the case. Akagi: It's not as if I did anything wrong. There is no rule that says alps can only have one contractor. Nanao: Don't act like that's normal. We usually don't have more than one witch at a time. Shuuji: A-Anyway... Akagi, Shiiba-san was already your witch at the time? Akagi: Correct. Shuuji: Then why did you form a contract with Kizuki-san? Shuuji: Meguru, Kizuki-san used to live around here, right? Meguru: Y-Yeah. Chi-chan's place was about a 10-minute walk from my house. Akagi: I had no special reason. The girl vacationed in the town where I and Tsumugi were. She and I got to know each other, and then we exchanged a contract. That is all. Akagi: And so, for a time, I occasionally visited this town to check in on her. Akagi: But, well... because of that, there may have been a minor territorial dispute with that cat over there. Nanao: I don't want to hear it, bird. This is why I can't deal with winged creatures. Nanao: You put me through a lot, back then. Akagi: But I'll actually go crazy if I don't travel every once in a while. Maybe because I used to be a migratory bird. A cat wouldn't understand. Nanao: Oh well, it's all in the past. I don't want to start a fight in front of Nene. Akagi: Good. But we digress. Akagi: Getting back on topic... I assume you wish to know what happened to Chihoko after that? Meguru: Y-Yeah! I do! Akagi: Then I shall tell you. Where should I start... Akagi: Chihoko started gathering fragments shortly after becoming my witch. Akagi: But this was more difficult for her than most other witches. Akagi: After all, the emotional price she had to pay was an unusually harsh one... Akagi: And to make matters worse, I was only occasionally around. I couldn't offer my support around the clock.  Akagi: However, despite the obstacles set before her, she cleared them all and completed her magic. Akagi: She was just that desperate to complete her wish. Akagi: It shows how important that wish was to her. Meguru: What was it... that Chi-chan had wished for? Akagi: ...... Akagi: \"I want you to cure Megu-chan's disease.\" Meguru: ...... Meguru: I've never had any disease that― Akagi: I thought so. I had a feeling this would be the case. Akagi: Chihoko's departure must have been a tremendous shock that left you scarred. Akagi: But your body, on the other hand, seems as healthy as can be. Meguru: Wait! Wait a moment... I can't deny the part about the hole in my heart, but... Meguru: It wasn't me who was sickly, but Chi-chan... Akagi: ...While Chihoko was a quiet and slender girl, she didn't have any serious illnesses. Akagi: The tremendous shock must have jumbled up your memories.  Meguru: ...... Akagi: Or perhaps having your body cured overnight caused your brain to process it that way in order to keep things logically consistent. Akagi: Either way, it was you who had been suffering from an incurable illness. I had heard so from none other than Chihoko herself. Akagi: She told me that, due to your weak body, you stayed at home most days reading books.  Meguru: Ah... Akagi: She also told me that you often played video games together. You're quite good at them, are you not? Meguru: ...I-I guess. Akagi: But I also need to talk about the price she paid in order to see that wish fulfilled. Akagi: For that price is what had caused your separation. Meguru: Wh-What kind of price was it? Akagi: Listen well. The number of fragments required fulfill her wish was excessive, perhaps due to the strength of the disease you were afflicted with. Akagi: And on that same token, the emotional price she had to pay was unusually heavy. Akagi: For instance... Tsumugi. The price you're paying is also harsh, but the worst that can happen is some nausea, and you're otherwise fine as long as you dress in men's clothes, correct? Tsumugi: Y-Yeah, right. It's pretty harsh for me personally, but there's no danger involved or anything... Akagi: ...But it wasn't the same for Chihoko. Akagi: There was no way to fully avoid her price, and no loopholes to avoid triggering it. Akagi: It was the kind of price that came with permanent consequences. Consequences that would last even after her wish was fulfilled. Akagi: And that was the issue... Meguru: I can't take this anymore. Just tell me already! What happened to Chi-chan?! Akagi: The price she paid was... Akagi: Forgetting anyone she was close to. Meguru: Ah... Akagi: Don't complain to me. No one can predict the kind of price you'll get in advance. Akagi: That was simply the price she got. That's all there is to say. Meguru: Then, Chi-chan... Akagi: ...Needless to say, she was stunned when she first learned of her price. And at first, she blamed me heavily for it. Akagi: However, she quickly resolved herself. Akagi: In order to avoid causing needless distress, she proceeded to gradually distance herself and cut ties from everyone she knew. Akagi: Yet she couldn't bring herself to do the same for you. Akagi: Even though she would eventually forget you as well... she endured that fear and remained by your side. Meguru: B-But why... Why would she go so far? Akagi: Well, because you were her best friend. Meguru: ...... Akagi: She told me this... Akagi: \"Megu-chan is actually a very cheerful girl. She's a wonderful person that anyone could come to love.\" Akagi: \"I'm really bad at making friends and only have Megu-chan, but deep down, she's different.\" Akagi: \"And to think she told me I'm her one and only friend. Her best friend in the whole world.\" Akagi: \"She said that as long as she has me, she doesn't need other friends.\" Akagi: \"Hearing that made me so very happy...\" Akagi: \"And so... I want to thank her.\" Akagi: \"I want to repay Megu-chan somehow.\" Akagi: \"I want to make the friend I'm so proud of be able to cheerfully run around outside.\" Akagi: \"I want her to be loved by everyone in her class.\" Akagi: \"Even if I end up forgetting about her...\" Akagi: \"...I want to help her become able to face life without me.\" Akagi: \"And to achieve that, I want to complete our contract and cure her disease.\" Meguru: ...... Akagi: The first to be forgotten was her parents. Akagi: They were beyond startled. They talked about medical examinations and surgery. They eventually decided to move somewhere far away for their daughter to live. Akagi: And then... At the very end, she even forgot her precious friend. The one her magic was meant for in the first place. Akagi: As a result... you ended up suddenly losing your best friend. Akagi: The lack of farewells was only natural. Chihoko had lost her memory of you by that point. Akagi: That was when her parents cut all ties to their life here and moved away with their daughter... Tsumugi: So that's what happened... Nene: That's why the school didn't have any records... Touko: ...You really don't where she went? Not even you? Akagi: No. I have no idea where she is living currently. Akagi: It is probably for the best to not look for her. I have no intention of doing that either. Akagi: It would likely only bother her and her parents and possibly even cause her undue stress. Meguru: So then... She's just... Shuuji: Kh... Akagi: Meguru, do you understand what that means? Meguru: Well... Meguru: Chi-chan cured my disease, but in exchange, she doesn't remember me anymore... Akagi: That's right! But to do that... Akagi: ...She saw it through to the end, even after she had already forgotten about you. Meguru: Ahh...! Akagi: Even I was surprised by that. Akagi: She really didn't remember you anymore. Akagi: But she told me that she could tell how important this was to do. Akagi: That by doing this, she was sure her wish would come true. Akagi: Despite the fact that she didn't even remember who that wish would cure anymore. Akagi: At the very end, she even forgot me. And yet, she still saw it through. Akagi: ...Chihoko was an amazing human. She said that she wanted this to serve as her farewell. Akagi: She may have forgotten you... But the magic she brought to life in exchange was literally Chihoko herself. Akagi: And that magic is now living on in your heart, Meguru. Meguru: Ah, aah... Meguru: Yeah...! Meguru: Senpai...! Akagi: That's right. Meguru: Thanks to Chi-chan... I... Meguru: I never left her thoughts... Meguru: My good health was Chi-chan's last gift to me. Meguru: It's Chi-chan's memories that are giving me life! Meguru: I...! I had never lost my best friend! Meguru: I haven't been able to do anything for Chi-chan! Meguru: It's so painful... I don't know how I can possibly repay Chi-chan for all she's done. Akagi: ...Let me tell you something here and now, Meguru. Akagi: I'm sure you were but an empty shell after losing Chihoko. Meguru: Y-Yeah... Akagi: But the girl I see today isn't just healthy. Akagi: She's surrounded by many friends. You're loved dearly. Everyone you see here now is giving you their full support, are they not? Meguru: Akagi... Akagi: Furthermore, I was honestly taken aback when I saw you today. Akagi: You are nothing like the child Chihoko described to me. You have a serious sense of fashion and, how should I put this... You're a real looker. Meguru: I'm dressing like this because... Akagi: You needn't say it. Both I and Chihoko know. Akagi: You recovered and got back on your feet because you knew that you couldn't let things continue as they had been, am I right? Meguru: Ah... Akagi: I am positive that was what Chihoko was truly wishing for. So rest assured! Akagi: For you have fulfilled Chihoko's wish as well. Meguru: ～～～～! Meguru: Waaaaaaah! Meguru: I'll do my best! I'll live strong for you! Meguru: You don't have to worry anymore... I'm strong now. Meguru: Wahh... Waaaaaah! "

But lunch break is almost over... Shuuji: It won't take long. Nene: Okay. Well then, we'll continue later. Meguru: Got it. Tsumugi: I'll head back to class now. Kanae: Mhm, nnngh... Teacher A: Hisashima-sensei, how are things going for that transfer student? Kanae: She's doing great. There aren't any problems so far. Teacher A: I see. I'm glad to hear that. Kids these days have such different values. I have no idea what they're thinking. Kanae: No matter how hard you try, you'll never be able to understand all of them, anyway. Teacher A: Yeah, I suppose so. Alright, time to go to my next class. Nene: It's weak, but the bottle is responding. It should be possible to retrieve fragments from her. Shuuji: Oh, nice. Nene: That would be a bad idea. Classes are about to start, and it would cause a scene if she suddenly collapsed in the faculty room. Shuuji: After school, then? But we need to help with the election... Nene: It's not like we need to do it right away. It should be alright to do it when we're about to go home. Shuuji: Yeah? Then let's go back to the classroom for now. Hideaki: Nnngh! Man, it's finally over. Wakana: Alright, time for my part-time job. Hideaki: Working again today, huh? What about you, Shuuji? Shuuji: Gonna help with the election stuff. Hideaki: Oh, the thing Shiiba-san's flier was about?  Wakana: Sorry. I'd help if I didn't have to work. Shuuji: Don't worry about it. Nene: Umm, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Ah, yeah. I know. Nene: It seems she left the classroom the moment school was over. Shuuji: Did she go on ahead of us? Touko: Oh, don't worry about it. Especially since you helped out this morning. Tsumugi: I'm done with that now, so I can start helping right away. Touko: Okay, thanks. Shuuji: Seems like no one's even accepting the fliers anymore. Tsumugi: Oh, I see... Shuuji: I feel like this is because everyone already knows, not because they don't care. Shuuji: A positive way to look at this would be that the advertising succeeded in spreading the word to everyone. But... Tsumugi: That doesn't do any good if no one actually wants to run for president. Shuuji: Right. I doubt this kind of simple advertising will get us any further. Shuuji: Yeah, if only that was so easy... Touko: Maybe people would look at the fliers more if we made them pink? Especially the guys. Shuuji: Togakushi-senpai... Touko: Sorry, sorry. But jokes aside, we can stop handing out fliers now. Tsumugi: Are you sure? Touko: I think just about everyone knows about the election by now, so handing out more fliers would be pretty meaningless. Touko: Besides, even if I'm retiring, I'm still the president for now and have lots of other things to do. So it's not like I'm going easy on you guys. Nene: Then... Touko: I'll wait and see how effective our advertising was and then take things from there myself. Meguru: Do you know of any good candidates other than that Koshiji-san person? Touko: I dunno... The other vice president is better suited for drafting reports, so if I was gonna persuade someone, it would probably be the secretary. Touko: Anywho, that's just another part of my job, so leave it all to me. Nene: ...Okay, we will. But please don't hesitate to let us know if there's anything else we can help with. Touko: Thank you, Ayachi-san. Nene: I'm very sorry we couldn't be of help. Touko: That's not true. Thanks to you, the rest of the council was able to keep working while we were out here spreading the word. Nene: Just let us know if there's anything else we can help with. We'll gladly do whatever we can. Touko: Okay, thank you. I'll take you up on that if we ever need the help. Touko: Alright then, let's call it a day. Tsumugi: But we already tried to come up with something during lunch break and couldn't. Meguru: Right... *sigh* Shuuji: Anyway, shouldn't we go somewhere else now? No point in standing around and talking here. Nene: We should call it a day. The sun's starting to set, after all. Meguru: Nene-senpai, can we go home together? Nene: Sorry, but I can't. There's something I need to do today. Meguru: Oh, really? That's too bad. Meguru: How about you, Shiiba-senpai? Got any plans? Tsumugi: Me? No, I don't. I was going to go straight home... You really want to walk home with me? Meguru: Of course! If you don't mind, I'd love to! Tsumugi: Of course I don't! I really want to as well. Meguru: Yay! Tsumugi: Ehehe. Meguru: Ah, what about you, Hoshina-senpai? Shuuji: Thanks for asking, but sorry. I got other plans. Meguru: Well, okay... Well, let's go, Shiiba-senpai. Where do you live? Tsumugi: Past the station. Meguru: Same as me, then! Umm... Would it be okay for me to call you Tsumugi-senpai? Tsumugi: Y-Yeah! Of course! "

            "Shuuji: Oh, that's great. Nanao: And also, Hoshina-kun, this is unexpected, but― Shuuji: What is it?! Is there another problem?! Nanao: Your magic has been erased too. Shuuji: ...Huh? You mean... Nanao: Your magic overflowed as well, allowing you to interfere with Togakushi-san's heart, correct? And your magic power was weak to begin with. Nanao: A large excess of magic flowed into you. Your power was temporarily enhanced but rendered you unable to control it, which resulted in your magic being completely erased. Shuuji: Then, that means... Nanao: You no longer have the power to sense people's emotions. Shuuji: Really...? Nanao: ...... Nanao: I know you said that you don't think you can socialize well without your power, but try not to be so anxious, okay? Shuuji: Honestly... I don't really know how what's going to happen from here out. Shuuji: Life might get more difficult for me, but I'll cross that bridge when I come to it. Shuuji: This is a fresh start for me. I'm just going to focus on being with Touko-san. Nanao: ...I see. Hehe. Nanao: This has been a good experience for me too. I've always been focused on learning more about humans and becoming one. Nanao: It seems there are things far more important than knowledge if you are to live as a human, however. There's a lot more left for me to research. Shuuji: I've learned some new things too. Shuuji: The reason my mom wanted her magic so badly was all because of one person. I never would've thought... I'm shocked, to be honest. Nanao: Oh, there's one more thing I should tell you, Hoshina-kun... Shuuji: Yeah? Shuuji: I'm so sorry! Nene: Huh? What? U-Umm... What are you sorry about? Shuuji: Well, you know how I took all that magic from you? Souma-san says it's all been erased from inside me. Shuuji: We think it reacted to my emotions and was used up as my own magic power. I'm so, so sorry! Nene: Ah, that's what you mean. You made me think something bad happened. Shuuji: ...Umm, you're not angry? Nene: Would being angry get me my magic back? Shuuji: Oh, uh, well... Nene: Hehe, I'm sorry. That was a mean question. I was just joking. Nene: I'm not angry. I'm just happy that Togakushi-senpai has woken up again. It's no problem at all. Shuuji: Ayachi-san... Nene: And hey. Take a look at this. Shuuji: Really? Nene: You didn't use them all up, Hoshina-kun. You only used a portion. The rest came back here. Nene: Just because you don't have to worry about Togakushi-senpai anymore, it doesn't mean you have to worry about me. Shuuji: But that still means I used up part of your magic. Nene: That's offset by what I've gained since you started helping out with the club. Actually, the number of fragments I have now is only a little lower than when I first met you. Nene: But please, you don't have to worry about me. A lot has happened, but how about we call it even? Shuuji: ...Sure, let's do that. Shuuji: I'm going to keep working at the OC though, even if I don't have anything to make up to you. Nene: Of course. You're more than welcome to. Meguru: Of course there is. We were so worried about you! You were gone for days. Touko: ...Sorry for worrying you so much. Touko: Oh, and thank you for the shawl. It's so cute. I just love it. Meguru: I'm glad you like it, but it's a present from everyone. Tsumugi: But you were the one who decided we should buy her a shawl and picked it out, Meguru-chan. Touko: You have such good taste, Inaba-san. Meguru: Y-You think? Ehehe... Meguru: Hey, today's not about me! We're here to celebrate Togakushi-senpai's return. Nene: That's right. Nene: Speaking of which, I brought some cake. Touko: You did? Shuuji: It came from a great shop that Inaba-san told us about. Meguru: Well, originally a friend from my class told me about it. It's all the rage. Nene: So we asked Hisashima-sensei to let us keep it cool in the staff fridge. Touko: I'm not sure this is something students are allowed to do... But I suppose it's fine for today! Meguru: Yeah! Tsumugi: This is a celebration, after all. Nene: Togakushi-senpai, what's your favorite kind of cake? Touko: I wonder... What do you have? Wow, these all look great! Hmm, I don't know which to go for... Shuuji: ...... Meguru, Tsumugi: ...... Touko: Huh? What is it? Oh, did someone call dibs on the gateau chocolat? Meguru: No, that's not the problem. Tsumugi: Togakushi-senpai, you seem kinda... cheerful? Not that you were gloomy before, but... Meguru: You're more excitable than usual. Not that that's a bad thing. It's super cool that you're happy. Nene: Hoshina-kun, what kind would you like? Shuuji: Oh, I'm good with whatever. You guys pick first. Meguru: Well then... Can I take the shortcake? Tsumugi: Yeah, that's fine. I'll go for... the cheesecake. Nene: I'll have the fruit tart. Touko: That leaves you with the mille-feuille, Shuu-kun. Here. Shuuji: Thank you very much. Shuuji: One more time then. Touko-san... Nene, Tsumugi, Meguru, Shuuji: Congratulations on your recovery! Touko: Yeah! Thanks, everyone. I'm glad to be back. Shuuji: Thanks, Inaba-san. Meguru: Let me guess... You guys spent all day today sucking face to make up for all that lost time? Touko: I-I can't answer that! Touko: ...... Nene, Tsumugi, Meguru: ...... Meguru: I don't know what to say... I didn't expect you to take that seriously. Tsumugi: I thought you'd just smile and go, \"mufufu, that's a secret.\" Nene: Didn't I tell them to refrain from doing that at school? Meguru: Now, now. They're two young lovebirds who've finally reunited. Who are we to stop them? Ehehe... Shuuji: Inaba-san, a girl shouldn't laugh like that. You sound like a dirty old man. Meguru: How dare you! I'm an innocent young maiden! Shuuji: If you're as innocent as you claim, then act like it! Tsumugi: But... You know, you've changed a bit, Togakushi-senpai. Touko: Yeah, I was thinking that I feel a bit different... I've been feeling more restless than usual. Tsumugi: Is that a bad thing? Touko: No. I feel restless, but... it's not all that bad. It makes being with you all even more fun. A-And... Touko: It means I love Shuu-kun even more than before. It's such a happy feeling. Shuuji: ...I'm really happy too. Touko: ...... Shuuji: ...... Touko, Shuuji: Hehehe.\nAhaha. Meguru: ...The cake was more than sweet enough, you two. Tsumugi: Hey now, we should be happy for them. Nene: Just please don't start kissing here. I'll get angry if you do. Shuuji: You really think I'd have the courage to do that here? Nene: Well, that's good then. Meguru: I'm sure that they'll be slobbering all over each other the moment we leave them alone. Shuuji: No we won't! Touko: Y-Yeah. There's no way we could kiss in front of other people. Sheesh. Meguru: That didn't seem to be a problem for you before... Tsumugi: Anyway, come on. Let's eat all this cake before someone comes in to talk to us. Nene: You're right. We should eat up before someone walks in on us... But let's try to savor it. Touko: ...? What is it? Shuuji: Oh, nothing really. Anyway, Touko-san. Touko: Hmm? Yeah? Shuuji: I just remembered... I haven't fulfilled my promise. Touko: What promise? Shuuji: You know, the promise to get you a present. You haven't forgotten, have you? Touko: Ah... You did promise that, didn't you? Back in the clubroom the day I collapsed. You said you'd buy me clothes to commemorate us going out. Shuuji: See? You do remember. Think we can do that over the weekend? Touko: Huh? O-Over the weekend? As in, this upcoming one? Shuuji: Is that a problem? Touko: It's not that I don't want to, but, um... I have a lot to do in preparation. The timing just isn't good, so... Shuuji: Well if you have stuff to do... I guess we'll just have to go another time. Touko: Geez. I told you not to give me those puppy-dog eyes. Touko: Anyway, I want to go on a date with you too, so... Shuuji: Is that a yes? Touko: Y-Yeah... Fine. I'll just have to go about this another way. I've got some studying to do! Shuuji: ...Studying?

Shuuji: I had this vague impression in my mind that rosy, romantic talk was the way to go.  Meguru: I really feel like that differs for everyone. In Hisashima-sensei's case, well... She'd probably just think you're stupid. Tsumugi: Yeah. I probably don't know her as well as you guys, but I can just picture her yelling \"Get to the damn point already.\" Shuuji: Ahh... Yeah. That's definitely in-line with her personality.  Shuuji: I see. Nene: Yes, if you would. Meguru: So, just a question, but is there any sort of breakthrough idea he's gonna get from these? Touko: Hmm, I guess that depends on what positive qualities he has... Touko: Hoshina-kun, you, Ayachi-san and Shiiba-san are in his class, right?  Tsumugi: I am, but I don't know him very well yet... Tsumugi: But from what I've seen, he seems funny and pretty cool.  Nene: He also seems quite proactive. Oh, and he's always smiling.  Shuuji: Yeah, he has a lot of guts at times, surprisingly. Kinda like with this, when he makes up his mind to do something, he gives it 110\\%.  Touko: If you just look at it on paper, it could work out, but... Meguru: The problem being she answered question number 11 with \"Shouldn't happen.\" That seems like a preeetty big hurdle to overcome... Shuuji: Well, it's up to Kaidou to make up his mind after seeing it. I'll go tell him the results in a bit. Tsumugi: So are we basically done for today, then?  Touko: Ah, one thing before that. I need to collect everyone's surveys. Have you guys all filled them out?  Meguru: Uh-huh. Here's mine.  Tsumugi: I did mine too. Just promise me you won't look. I'm a little embarrassed.  Touko: I won't, I won't. There'd be no point in making it anonymous if I did. Just give it to me face down and I'll shuffle it in with the rest. Shuuji: Ahh, crap... Sorry. I forgot to do mine... Touko: Come on now, Hoshina-kun. You gotta keep your promises. Nene: I'm sorry... I actually forgot to do mine too. Touko: Even you did? Meguru: Wow. You never make silly mistakes like forgetting to do something.  Touko: Do you have the surveys on you? Shuuji: Sorry. I think I left mine on my table at home... Touko: Well, nothing we can do about that. Just make sure you get them to me tomorrow after school and I'll take them to the Newspaper Club with the rest. Shuuji: Okay. Nene: Thank you.  Shuuji: Also, she basically lives the life of a single, middle-aged man. Here's a basic summary of her answers.  Shuuji: So do you know what you're gonna do? Hideaki: Nope. But now that I got this information, I'm gonna give it some serious thought. Hideaki: Looking at this stuff, though... Shit, how do I confess? What approach is gonna do me the best... Hideaki: I just hope I find something I can use as a starting point.  Shuuji: Look, you don't have to force yourself to go through with it now because of our help.  Hideaki: Besides, getting it off my chest helped out a lot. I'll be able to think about everything calmly.  Shuuji: Glad to hear. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Just curious... But what exactly does it feel like to love someone so much you feel like you're going crazy?  Hideaki: Well... Didn't I already tell you? You think about that person 24/7 and can't help it.  Hideaki: You want to talk with her, you follow her with your eyes whenever you're around her. You try and think of ways to spend time with her and get jealous over the dumbest things... Hideaki: Frankly speaking, it's all shit that seems pretty creepy when you stop and think about it.  Hideaki: But no matter how weird you think it is, you can't do a damn thing to stop it. When you see her having fun or smiling, it's the sweetest feeling in the world. Shuuji: You find yourself staring at her when she smiles?  Hideaki: Oh, you betcha. Happens all the time.  Shuuji: What about dreams? Do you dream about her too? Hideaki: Occasionally. That happens when you're thinking about her 'round the clock. Awake or asleep doesn't matter.  Shuuji: Hmm... I see... Shuuji: No, no, it's nothing! Hideaki: You're a goddamn open book, I swear.  Shuuji: ...... Hideaki: No need to hide it, man. Nothing embarrassing about being in love with Ayachi-san. Anybody would with a girl that cute around.  Shuuji: It's not like I'm embarrassed about― Shuuji: Wait, how did you narrow it down to Ayachi-san? Hideaki: Oh-ho, what is that I hear? Do you dare try to deny it?  Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: ...Was it that obvious? Hideaki: Definitely. I'd say anyone who knows you a bit better would notice immediately. Shuuji: Well... I guess she doesn't mind me. Shuuji: Well, a lot's happened.  Hideaki: So are you gonna tell her? I can tell you, you're sure as hell not gonna get anywhere if you just keep wracking your brains over it.  Shuuji: ...Hmm. Shuuji: What do you think I should do? Hideaki: That's for you to decide, man. It's your life, not mine.  Shuuji: That's what you say after egging me on to confess? Hideaki: Hahahaha. What I'm basically saying is, give it some serious thought.  Shuuji: Yeah. Hideaki: Oh right. Would you mind letting me return the key? Shuuji: Sure, fine by me... Do you want to talk to Sensei? Hideaki: You're not supposed to say it, man.  Hideaki: We're here to return the key. Kanae: Hm? Ah, right. Thanks. Kanae: But seriously, just what were you two guys doing in there two days in a row? Shuuji: Completely normal things.  Hideaki: Don't go spreading any funny rumors about us now, Kanae-chan. Kanae: Don't call me Kanae-chan. And especially not in the faculty room.

            "Nanao: Yes, in all kinds of ways. You would never expect an alp to tell anyone about their contractors, especially not in the presence of another alp. Nanao: Not to mention how both alps are willingly partaking in this. And also... Well, let's just say this is unprecedented. Nene: Shiiba-san and I are able to get along great, so you alps shouldn't fight either. Nanao: We made sure to set some ground rules so we wouldn't. Nanao: Oh well, it's fine. This is just a one-time thing. I'll trust you on this. Shuuji: Thank you, Souma-san. Nanao: Why are you the one thanking me? Shuuji: Oh, uh... Well... Tsumugi: Sorry to keep you all waiting! Tsumugi: Umm, this girl here is Akagi. Akagi: I am indeed Akagi. Although there is only one of you I have not yet met. Nene: It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Nanao's witch, Ayachi Nene. Akagi: The pleasure is all mine. Nene: ...Fascinating. She really does talk in a bit of an old-fashioned way. Nanao: Yeah, I know. I'm joining in too. Akagi: Well, you already know half of it anyway. There is hardly any reason for us to fight now. Nanao: I agree. That doesn't change how unnatural this meeting is, though. Akagi: That is only because you are such a stickler for the rules. But I shan't let that bother me this time. Akagi: Also, bring me a glass of milk. Tsumugi: Ah, umm. I'll go with a lemon tea. Nanao: Understood. Your orders will be coming right up. Akagi: So then... Akagi: You can talk more at ease. I don't like stiff talk. Shuuji: Okay, Akagi. Akagi: Good. Akagi: You... have magic in you, don't you? How very peculiar. No wonder you're allowed to accompany the two witches here. Shuuji: I don't really know much about that myself... Shuuji: But you're a little wrong about something. It's me who wants to know about Kizuki-san. Akagi: Do you know Chihoko? Shuuji: ...More like, I know someone who does. Akagi: Well, it's fine either way. What do you wish to know? Akagi: No idea. Shuuji: Wait, what?! Akagi: I simply thought that it would be better for me not to know. Shuuji: ...... Akagi: After all, the girl no longer knows anything about me either. Akagi: But that was part of the price she paid in order to see her wish fulfilled. That's how it is in our world. Nene: You mean... Tsumugi: A witch... Akagi: Indeed. You have it right. Akagi: She even lost her friend in order to have her wish fulfilled. Akagi: If I remember correctly... Her name was Inaba Meguru. Akagi: I don't understand much about friendship, but it's something humans value, is it not? And Chihoko has lost her only one. I have no idea where and how Chihoko or that Meguru girl are living their lives now... Meguru: ...... Touko: Hmm, it's so quiet when it's just two of us. Touko: I'm trying to liven things up, but I'm the only one talking. Meguru: ...I'm sorry. Touko: Ooh, you actually said something! Though, I'm still not sure how I'm supposed to make this more fun for us. Touko: But I'll try my best. You can talk to me about anything, and I won't say a word to anyone. Give it a shot! Meguru: ...... Meguru: W-Will do, then. Touko: Great! I'm ready! Meguru: Umm... Meguru: Don't you think this is really mean?! Touko: What is, exactly? Meguru: That they left us behind and went out with just the three of them! Touko: You wanted to go with them? Touko: You didn't want to stay here together with me? Meguru: That's not what I meant... Touko: Phew... I thought you hated me for a moment, there. Meguru: O-Of course I don't hate you! But... Touko: Yeah? You can go into more detail with me, if you'd like. Touko: You may feel better after talking to someone. Meguru: O-Okay... Umm... So... Touko: ...... Touko: You don't hate me, but...? Meguru: Ah! Right... Meguru: ...It's just so frustrating. Meguru: Why Nene-senpai and Tsumugi-senpai? Why didn't he ask me? Touko: Hmm... Meguru: And it seemed like the same thing happened yesterday. I just... Touko: Hmm... Can I ask you one question? Meguru: Ah, y-yeah. What is it? Touko: You're talking about Hoshina-kun, right? Meguru: ...? Well, yeah. Touko: Right, thought so. But... Touko: I don't think it was necessarily Hoshina-kun who invited Ayachi-san and Shiiba-san to go shopping today, you know. Meguru: ...... Meguru: Th-That may be so, but it's basically the same thing either way. Meguru: I'm still being left behind... Touko: Hmm... Well, I can't deny that. Touko: But, really... I see... Mufufu♪ Meguru: Wh-What's so funny? Touko: Nothing. I'm thinking about some tea. Do you want some? Meguru: ...Yeah. Touko: Gotcha. Just give me a few moments. Meguru: Ahhh... This is so frustrating. It's killing me! Touko: Oh gosh, how adorable. Touko: You know, Inaba-san, the way I see it... Meguru: Yeah...? Touko: You're the only one Hoshina-kun has eyes for. Meguru: ...... Meguru: Wh-What are you saying? There's no way that's true. Touko: Really? Meguru: Well, I mean... Meguru: It's not like Senpai is here with― Shuuji: %130;Meguru!! Meguru: Ah! Shuuji: What...? Touko: Oh, never mind me. Touko: You're in an awful hurry for someone who's just coming back from a shopping trip. Also, where are Ayachi-san and Shiiba-san? Shuuji: Oh, they're at... You know that place I brought you to before? Shuuji: They're there, at the Schwarze Katze. Touko: Oh yeah, that cafe. Their parfaits are wonderful. Shuuji: Anyway, Meguru! Meguru: Huh?! Y-Yeah! Shuuji: Sorry, I was in such a rush... I should have called you on the way here or asked Ayachi-san and Shiiba-san to do so... Shuuji: Anyway! That doesn't matter since you're still here. Meguru: U-Umm... Senpai? Shuuji: Would you come with me? Meguru: Huh? Touko: What about me, Hoshina-kun? Shuuji: Yeah, you too, please. You've done a lot to help us, so... I don't want to keep secrets anymore. Touko: Alrighty. I shall accompany you. Meguru: Umm, hey, so, Senpai! What is this― Shuuji: Sorry, Meguru. I need apologize in advance. Meguru: Huh?! Wh-What the heck is happening?! Shuuji: I'll explain later. Just come with me! Shuuji: We've found out what happened to Kizuki-san! Meguru: Huh? Chi-chan...? Nene: ―And that about covers it. Magic is real, and we are witches. Nene: You need to know these things, or else you'll find it hard to comprehend what we're about to talk about. Nene: I know this must be sudden, but please accept it for now. Meguru: O-Okay...? Meguru: Oh, well, umm... This doesn't seem like the kind of thing you can go around telling people willy-nilly, so umm, like... I don't really mind. Meguru: Actually, I feel kinda bad because I'm not sure I'm really following all this... Nene: I can explain any of the finer details you don't understand later. Nene: Togakushi-senpai, the same goes for you. Touko: Gotcha. I'm already grateful enough to be included in this.  Meguru: ...S-So, umm! Meguru: Senpai, you said you found out about Chi-chan... Shuuji: Yeah... We actually found someone who knows Kizuki-san. Shuuji: Akagi, can you take it from here? Akagi: Of course. Akagi: Rest assured, I'm not as young as I look. I am much older than you and Chihoko. Akagi: ...So you're Meguru, huh? My name is Akagi. I have heard a lot about you from Chihoko. Akagi: Mainly that you were her one and only friend. Her best friend. Meguru: ......!! Meguru: P-Please! Please tell me about Chi-chan! Akagi: In due time. Let us sit down, first. Meguru: Okay! Akagi: Also... Hey, I want my milk! Meguru: A-A glass of milk, please! Akagi: Haha... I had already ordered the milk, lass. Meguru: ...Huh? What the heck is \"milk glass\"? Shuuji: No, she said \"lass.\" She doesn't talk like a normal girl. Just think of her as your typical unaging loli. Meguru: ...Oh yeah! I see those in games and stuff all the time. Makes sense. Meguru: Ahaha... Milk is fine for me too. Akagi: Excellent choice. Matching drinks for the who share a bond with Chihoko. Akagi: Indeed, I can. I shall explain everything from the beginning. Meguru: What...? Akagi: That is, she was a witch. She had a wish that she wanted more than anything. Akagi: And so we formed a contract to fulfill that wish, thus making Chihoko my witch. Akagi: ...Meguru, do you understand everything so far? Meguru: Yeah... Meguru: I had no idea Chi-chan was a witch... Akagi: Your surprise is only natural. Witches tend not to talk about magic to those unrelated to our craft. Akagi: But it is different now; you have already been informed about us. Hence, I'm able to tell you now. It was necessary in order explain her current situation. Tsumugi: Actually I didn't know about that either. Tsumugi: You never told me that you made a contract with Chihoko-chan while you already had a contract with me... Shuuji: Oh, yeah... I guess that would've had to have been the case. Akagi: It's not as if I did anything wrong. There is no rule that says alps can only have one contractor. Nanao: Don't act like that's normal. We usually don't have more than one witch at a time. Shuuji: A-Anyway... Akagi, Shiiba-san was already your witch at the time? Akagi: Correct. Shuuji: Then why did you form a contract with Kizuki-san? Shuuji: Meguru, Kizuki-san used to live around here, right? Meguru: Y-Yeah. Chi-chan's place was about a 10-minute walk from my house. Akagi: I had no special reason. The girl vacationed in the town where I and Tsumugi were. She and I got to know each other, and then we exchanged a contract. That is all. Akagi: And so, for a time, I occasionally visited this town to check in on her. Akagi: But, well... because of that, there may have been a minor territorial dispute with that cat over there. Nanao: I don't want to hear it, bird. This is why I can't deal with winged creatures. Nanao: You put me through a lot, back then. Akagi: But I'll actually go crazy if I don't travel every once in a while. Maybe because I used to be a migratory bird. A cat wouldn't understand. Nanao: Oh well, it's all in the past. I don't want to start a fight in front of Nene. Akagi: Good. But we digress. Akagi: Getting back on topic... I assume you wish to know what happened to Chihoko after that? Meguru: Y-Yeah! I do! Akagi: Then I shall tell you. Where should I start... Akagi: Chihoko started gathering fragments shortly after becoming my witch. Akagi: But this was more difficult for her than most other witches. Akagi: After all, the emotional price she had to pay was an unusually harsh one... Akagi: And to make matters worse, I was only occasionally around. I couldn't offer my support around the clock.  Akagi: However, despite the obstacles set before her, she cleared them all and completed her magic. Akagi: She was just that desperate to complete her wish. Akagi: It shows how important that wish was to her. Meguru: What was it... that Chi-chan had wished for? Akagi: ...... Akagi: \"I want you to cure Megu-chan's disease.\" Meguru: ...... Meguru: I've never had any disease that― Akagi: I thought so. I had a feeling this would be the case. Akagi: Chihoko's departure must have been a tremendous shock that left you scarred. Akagi: But your body, on the other hand, seems as healthy as can be. Meguru: Wait! Wait a moment... I can't deny the part about the hole in my heart, but... Meguru: It wasn't me who was sickly, but Chi-chan... Akagi: ...While Chihoko was a quiet and slender girl, she didn't have any serious illnesses. Akagi: The tremendous shock must have jumbled up your memories.  Meguru: ...... Akagi: Or perhaps having your body cured overnight caused your brain to process it that way in order to keep things logically consistent. Akagi: Either way, it was you who had been suffering from an incurable illness. I had heard so from none other than Chihoko herself. Akagi: She told me that, due to your weak body, you stayed at home most days reading books.  Meguru: Ah... Akagi: She also told me that you often played video games together. You're quite good at them, are you not? Meguru: ...I-I guess. Akagi: But I also need to talk about the price she paid in order to see that wish fulfilled. Akagi: For that price is what had caused your separation. Meguru: Wh-What kind of price was it? Akagi: Listen well. The number of fragments required fulfill her wish was excessive, perhaps due to the strength of the disease you were afflicted with. Akagi: And on that same token, the emotional price she had to pay was unusually heavy. Akagi: For instance... Tsumugi. The price you're paying is also harsh, but the worst that can happen is some nausea, and you're otherwise fine as long as you dress in men's clothes, correct? Tsumugi: Y-Yeah, right. It's pretty harsh for me personally, but there's no danger involved or anything... Akagi: ...But it wasn't the same for Chihoko. Akagi: There was no way to fully avoid her price, and no loopholes to avoid triggering it. Akagi: It was the kind of price that came with permanent consequences. Consequences that would last even after her wish was fulfilled. Akagi: And that was the issue... Meguru: I can't take this anymore. Just tell me already! What happened to Chi-chan?! Akagi: The price she paid was... Akagi: Forgetting anyone she was close to. Meguru: Ah... Akagi: Don't complain to me. No one can predict the kind of price you'll get in advance. Akagi: That was simply the price she got. That's all there is to say. Meguru: Then, Chi-chan... Akagi: ...Needless to say, she was stunned when she first learned of her price. And at first, she blamed me heavily for it. Akagi: However, she quickly resolved herself. Akagi: In order to avoid causing needless distress, she proceeded to gradually distance herself and cut ties from everyone she knew. Akagi: Yet she couldn't bring herself to do the same for you. Akagi: Even though she would eventually forget you as well... she endured that fear and remained by your side. Meguru: B-But why... Why would she go so far? Akagi: Well, because you were her best friend. Meguru: ...... Akagi: She told me this... Akagi: \"Megu-chan is actually a very cheerful girl. She's a wonderful person that anyone could come to love.\" Akagi: \"I'm really bad at making friends and only have Megu-chan, but deep down, she's different.\" Akagi: \"And to think she told me I'm her one and only friend. Her best friend in the whole world.\" Akagi: \"She said that as long as she has me, she doesn't need other friends.\" Akagi: \"Hearing that made me so very happy...\" Akagi: \"And so... I want to thank her.\" Akagi: \"I want to repay Megu-chan somehow.\" Akagi: \"I want to make the friend I'm so proud of be able to cheerfully run around outside.\" Akagi: \"I want her to be loved by everyone in her class.\" Akagi: \"Even if I end up forgetting about her...\" Akagi: \"...I want to help her become able to face life without me.\" Akagi: \"And to achieve that, I want to complete our contract and cure her disease.\" Meguru: ...... Akagi: The first to be forgotten was her parents. Akagi: They were beyond startled. They talked about medical examinations and surgery. They eventually decided to move somewhere far away for their daughter to live. Akagi: And then... At the very end, she even forgot her precious friend. The one her magic was meant for in the first place. Akagi: As a result... you ended up suddenly losing your best friend. Akagi: The lack of farewells was only natural. Chihoko had lost her memory of you by that point. Akagi: That was when her parents cut all ties to their life here and moved away with their daughter... Tsumugi: So that's what happened... Nene: That's why the school didn't have any records... Touko: ...You really don't where she went? Not even you? Akagi: No. I have no idea where she is living currently. Akagi: It is probably for the best to not look for her. I have no intention of doing that either. Akagi: It would likely only bother her and her parents and possibly even cause her undue stress. Meguru: So then... She's just... Shuuji: Kh... Akagi: Meguru, do you understand what that means? Meguru: Well... Meguru: Chi-chan cured my disease, but in exchange, she doesn't remember me anymore... Akagi: That's right! But to do that... Akagi: ...She saw it through to the end, even after she had already forgotten about you. Meguru: Ahh...! Akagi: Even I was surprised by that. Akagi: She really didn't remember you anymore. Akagi: But she told me that she could tell how important this was to do. Akagi: That by doing this, she was sure her wish would come true. Akagi: Despite the fact that she didn't even remember who that wish would cure anymore. Akagi: At the very end, she even forgot me. And yet, she still saw it through. Akagi: ...Chihoko was an amazing human. She said that she wanted this to serve as her farewell. Akagi: She may have forgotten you... But the magic she brought to life in exchange was literally Chihoko herself. Akagi: And that magic is now living on in your heart, Meguru. Meguru: Ah, aah... Meguru: Yeah...! Meguru: Senpai...! Akagi: That's right. Meguru: Thanks to Chi-chan... I... Meguru: I never left her thoughts... Meguru: My good health was Chi-chan's last gift to me. Meguru: It's Chi-chan's memories that are giving me life! Meguru: I...! I had never lost my best friend! Meguru: I haven't been able to do anything for Chi-chan! Meguru: It's so painful... I don't know how I can possibly repay Chi-chan for all she's done. Akagi: ...Let me tell you something here and now, Meguru. Akagi: I'm sure you were but an empty shell after losing Chihoko. Meguru: Y-Yeah... Akagi: But the girl I see today isn't just healthy. Akagi: She's surrounded by many friends. You're loved dearly. Everyone you see here now is giving you their full support, are they not? Meguru: Akagi... Akagi: Furthermore, I was honestly taken aback when I saw you today. Akagi: You are nothing like the child Chihoko described to me. You have a serious sense of fashion and, how should I put this... You're a real looker. Meguru: I'm dressing like this because... Akagi: You needn't say it. Both I and Chihoko know. Akagi: You recovered and got back on your feet because you knew that you couldn't let things continue as they had been, am I right? Meguru: Ah... Akagi: I am positive that was what Chihoko was truly wishing for. So rest assured! Akagi: For you have fulfilled Chihoko's wish as well. Meguru: ～～～～! Meguru: Waaaaaaah! Meguru: I'll do my best! I'll live strong for you! Meguru: You don't have to worry anymore... I'm strong now. Meguru: Wahh... Waaaaaah! "

Hehehe, I can finally go to sleep happy again.\" Touko: \"Thank you so much, Shuu-kun.\" Shuuji: So please wake up, Touko-san! Shuuji: This must be the smile that Touko-san has been yearning after... Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: What am I doing here? If this is Touko-san's dream, then... how am I inside of it? Touko: I'm sure it's because your magic is rampaging too, Shuu-kun. Shuuji: Touko-san?! Touko: That allowed you to touch my heart and be swallowed by my magic seal. And now, we're sharing my dream. Shuuji: My magic is overflowing...? Touko: Yes... Your magic is overflowing by quite the amount. Surely this magic can't all be yours. Do you know what could have given you so much magic? Touko: I think that a large quantity of magic responded to your prayer. Touko: Hmm... I am Togakushi Touko. The Togakushi Touko you know, Shuu-kun, but also the Togakushi Touko you don't know. Shuuji: Are you saying that you have your memories from when you were an alp? Touko: ...Yes. So you know about that. About how I'm not normal. Shuuji: I don't know the details, only that you might have been the alp who formed a contract with my mom. Touko: You're spot on. Did that woman tell you? The other alp you know. Shuuji: Yes. Her name is Souma Nanao, and she's the one who taught me what my power really is. Touko: Is she the alp that formed a contract with Ayachi-san... or Shiiba-san? Shuuji: Ayachi-san. Touko: I see... Shuuji: If you know about Ayachi-san, Shiiba-san and Souma-san, then... Shuuji: Does that mean you were aware of what was going on earlier? Touko: ...... Touko: Yeah. I have no awareness of the outside world... But earlier I felt magic flowing into me, which was accompanied by Ayachi-san's and Shiiba-san's presence. Touko: As well as the presence of an alp I didn't know. I was sure they were trying to drag me out of here... Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Touko-san, please just tell me one thing. Souma-san told me that you were the one who rejected the magic flowing into you earlier. Shuuji: Is that true? You realized what was going on and... you stopped it? Touko: Well... Shuuji: Touko-san... Do you want to stay in the coma-like state you're in? Touko: I don't! I don't at all. Touko: I don't want to stay like this... I feel terrible being locked away in my dreams and making everyone worry. Shuuji: Then― Touko: But, after what I did... Shuuji: ...What do you mean? Touko: Your mother looks so happy, doesn't she, Shuu-kun? Shuuji: Yeah... Shuuji: Yeah, my dad told me. She grew sick and lost her hearing. Touko: Indeed. That was several years before she met me. Touko: At first, you know, I thought about forming a contract to restore her hearing. But that wasn't a contract she could form. Touko: She didn't wish for it from the bottom of her heart. Without a strong wish, you can't form a contract. Touko: It was hard and inconvenient on her, but she simply didn't want to wish for her hearing to return. Touko: In fact, she seemed eager to face those hardships head-on. She was so strong. She was like an innocent child, always quick to burst into tears but never allowing herself to be broken. Shuuji: ...Is that what she was like? Touko: She completely captured my interest. I had never met a human as special as her before. Touko: But that strength of hers changed when she met a certain man. Shuuji: You mean... my dad? Touko: Yeah. She said she couldn't figure him out at all. He was always so bright, cheerful and kind, but he was also terribly tactless... She really couldn't understand him. Shuuji: Ahh... That's my dad, alright. Touko: But he was the person who tried to understand her the most, and not out of pity. They took a mutual interest in each other. Touko: She'd never met anyone like him before. Nor had she met anyone she understood so little about... So she wanted to know more. Touko: That was ultimately what made her regret losing her hearing the most. Shuuji: That sounds like she was wishing for her hearing back to me. Touko: Not quite. It wasn't just his words she wanted to understand, but how he felt. Touko: And that wish was enough to make Hinata Yui form a contract with an alp. All for a single man. Shuuji: Mom... Touko: When I saw how happy she was after falling in love, however... all of my interest switched to the emotion itself. Touko: I couldn't control my curiosity and made the decision to live as a human. Touko: And so... all of my memories and emotions now belong to the human known as Togakushi Touko. Shuuji: Then... Touko: I've always wanted to know what love is. But... nothing else. Touko: I went to school, studied, chatted with peers, then went home and slept. Every day was the same. Touko: I was truly empty without my old memories. I went through every day as a hollow shell, lacking purpose. Shuuji: So then the reason you rejected the light was... Shuuji: Because you were scared. Touko: ...You know, when I decided to become a human, I really did plan on throwing away my memories as an alp. Touko: But the prospect of losing them frightened me. I didn't know if I'd truly be able to live as a human... Touko: So as insurance, I saved a part of my memories in my dreams, using the last of my power as an alp. Touko: In my dreams alone, I got to revisit my past memories. That way, I could ensure that I wouldn't forget why it was I wanted to become human. Shuuji: So that means... Shuuji: If you were to escape from this situation, you'd completely lose all your memories as an alp? Touko: ...Yes. Unless my rampaging magic were to naturally settle down. Touko: When Ayachi-san and Shiiba-san reached out to me, I wasn't strong enough to reach back... Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: I understand how you feel, Touko-san. But, what do you plan to do? You don't think you can just remain like this, do you? Touko: Well... Shuuji: I want to keep spending time with you like we have been. Touko: ...Me too. Touko: I want to be with you too... I really do. But I can't throw my memories away. Touko: I won't be myself anymore if I do. I'll truly be empty. So I... Touko: I'm sorry... I'm so sorry, Shuu-kun. But I... Shuuji: DON'T DO THIS!!! Shuuji: I know you need me too! I know this, after all the time we've spent together! Shuuji: We made so many precious memories together! Memories we will both cherish! So, please! Shuuji: Stop clinging to the past and choose me! Shuuji: You became human to experience love for yourself! Shuuji: So stay by my side! That's my wish! Tsumugi: \"We miss you so much, Togakushi-senpai. I want to see that kind smile of yours again. We're all waiting for you.\" Shuuji: Everyone is worried about you! You have a place to come back to! Are you really going to call that life empty?! Shuuji: I don't care about anything else! Just hurry up and choose me! Touko: Shuu-kun... Shuuji: Shut up! That's enough! I don't want to hear your opinion. Shuuji: Just shut up and come with me right now! Shuuji: And I'm not ever letting go. I hope you're ready for me to hold onto you forever. Shuuji: Because I don't ever want you to leave me again, Touko-san. Shuuji: We'll be so happy together. So much happier than watching a dream could ever make you. Touko: ...... Shuuji: You don't have to cling to the past anymore. You don't need to cling to someone else's love anymore. Shuuji: Or are you saying that you prefer your dreams of the past over my warmth? Touko: ...... Shuuji: Well, I'm not letting you go even if you refuse. I love you too much. Touko: Yeah... Yeah... You're right. This warmth is so nice. It's warmth that I can have for myself, not through my dream... and it's been here all along. Shuuji: I know that you're scared, but I'll make up for that. I won't let you feel empty. Shuuji: We'll fill up that emptiness together, with all the memories we'll make from here on out. Touko: ...... Touko: I'm sorry, Shuu-kun... I'm so weak. I ran away instead of trusting in you. Shuuji: That doesn't matter. I've caught you now. Touko: Yeah. Thank you, Shuu-kun. Touko: And I'm sorry. I've made you and everyone else worry about me so much. Touko: I've been so selfish. Shuuji: Yeah, you're gonna have to reflect on that. Like, a lot. Don't you dare do something like this ever again. Touko: Yeah... I'm sorry... Touko: I love you too, Shuu-kun... I love you so much. Touko: You're right... How can I be empty when I'm full of love for you? Shuuji: You're not leaving me again. Shuuji: Wherever you go, I'll be right behind you. Touko: I can't escape, huh? I managed to get quite the dangerous boyfriend. Shuuji: Yeah, you did. So now you have to take responsibility for making me fall in love with you. Touko: Isn't that what the girl normally says? Touko: I can feel yours too... Touko: They're burning hot. It's so wonderful to know I'm loved this much. Touko: I'm happy... So, so happy... Shuuji: Yeah, you better believe I love you that much. Shuuji: That's why these past few days have been so hard. Touko: Ah... I'm so sorry about that. Shuuji: It's fine. It's all in the past now. You've just made me a very happy man, so all is forgiven. Touko: Thank you... Shuuji: Though, I can only speak for myself. Who knows if Ayachi-san and the others will forgive you. Touko: Ugh... Don't say something so scary! Shuuji: I'm just kidding. Shuuji: Please let me say this, though. The only reason I can joke around like this is that I resolved everything. Touko: Yeah... I'm sorry... Touko: But I'm not going to waver anymore. Shuuji: I haven't even wavered once. That's just how much I love you, Touko-san. Touko: I love you too. I mean it. "

My mind is going blank... Ahh! Ahh, fwah, aaah! Shuuji: Ngh, Tsumugi... Are you about to cum? Tsumugi: Yeah, but! Aahh, nngahh! Only because of you! Shuuji-kun, Shuuji-kun! Shuuji: Ngh... After you made me endure your boobjob for so long? Tsumugi: Yeah but! Ahn, ah... This feels way better than the first time. It's... It's your fault for making me feel so good! Tsumugi: Ahh! Hahh, ahnn... Fwah, ah, aaah! I-I'm gonna cum, I'm gonna cum I'm gonna cum! Shuuji-kun, I'm gonna cum! Tsumugi: Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!! Shuuji: Of course it felt good. But look... Shuuji: Yeah, so can we go again? I want you. Tsumugi: Y-Yeah, okay. I, I want to... feel good again too. Hahh! Ahh! Shuuji: Tsumugi... Tsumugi! *kiss* Mmph! Tsumugi: Shuuji-kuuunn! Mmpah, mmph, mmpah! *kiss* *kiss* *kiss* Nnmm, mmph! Shuuji: Tsumugi, Tsumugi! I love you too, Tsumugi! Tsumugi: Ahnn! *pant* *pant* Ahh! Shuuji-kun, you're, you're... Mm! Tsumugi: You're too good! You're gonna make me cum agaaiiin! Ah, aaah?! Shuuji: I'm... I'm gonna cum too. I'm gonna cum inside you again! Tsumugi: Okay... Give me your semen, Shuuji-kun! Please, please, release it inside me! Ahh! Hahh, aah?! Shuuji: I'm... I'm gonna cum too! Tsumugi! Tsumugi! Tsumugi: Shuuji-kun! Shuuji-kun! Ah, hahh, ah, ahh! Shuuji-kun, Shuuji-kuuun! Shuuji: Ngh, Tsumugi! Tsumugi! I'm gonna cum! Tsumugi: Good, good! Cum, cum... Let it all out! Shuuji-kun, Shuuji-kun, I love you! Tsumugi: Fill up me up with your semen! Haah, aaah?! Tsumugi: Aaah, hahh, ah, haaaaaaaahhhh! Shuuji: Sorry. Did you not like it? Tsumugi: No, I did... But I wouldn't if it was anyone else. You're the only one who gets to do this with me. Tsumugi: This is the only time we have to be connected. Tsumugi: Nnhaah! Ahh... Shuuji-kun! If you keep thrusting up, ahh, while groping my boobs, then... Haaahh! Shuuji: Tsumugi... I'm, I'm gonna cum again too! Tsumugi: Haahh, ahh! R-Really? Ahn! I can... I can feel you getting bigger inside me! Haahh! Shuuji: Tsumugi, can I cum on you? I want to mark you. I want to prove you're mine. Tsumugi: Haah, ahh! Shuuji-kun? Okay, mark me, I want you to... mark me for yourself. Shuuji: Hold on a little more! Tsumugi, I love you! Tsumugi! Tsumugi: I, I love you too! Shuuji-kun, I love you, I love you I love you I love you! Shuuji-kun, Shuuji-kun! Tsumugi: Haahg, haah, ahh! I love you, I love you! Haah, ahhh?! Ahhh! Tsumugi: Haah, ahh, ahh! Haaaaaaaaaaaaah! Shuuji: Don't you hate being so sticky? Tsumugi: Actually, it makes me happy. I mean... it's your semen. Tsumugi: And this is... the only time we can touch each other. Tsumugi: So I just want to stay like this for a while. Shuuji: You got it. Shuuji: Akagi... You came back, huh? Akagi: I know where she hides the spare key. I can come and go as I please. Shuuji: Tsumugi would get angry again if she heard you saying that. Akagi: Why? I've done nothing wrong. Akagi: Without my assistance, she never would have gone into town to expedite the fragment collection process. Akagi: Nor would she be taking such a proactive approach to copulation, which she hated the idea of at the beginning. Akagi: She's doing it all for your sake, boy. Shuuji: ...... Akagi: It is true that I have profited greatly in these transactions. Akagi: But the increased results of her work make it all worthwhile! Akagi: It's thanks to you two that I can spend much longer in my human form. Akagi: Before, I never could comprehend why humans liked music. It was nothing but noise to me. Akagi: Nor could I tell why they appreciated paintings when photographs exist. Akagi: But now I understand. Shuuji: ...Really? Akagi: Yes. And I'm not the only one profiting here. Akagi: Wonderful things have been happening to both you and Tsumugi, haven't they boy? Akagi: And that's all thanks to me! You should be grateful. Shuuji: You're still miles away from being human. Shuuji: That you can't understand what I mean is proof enough. Akagi: You make no sense. Akagi: Even when you're a teddy bear, Tsumugi is happy because she gets to spend longer with you. Akagi: And your limited time as a human has led her to being more proactive as well. Akagi: You're the one who doesn't understand. Shuuji: ...Perhaps the old me would've realized that Tsumugi's smile is fake much sooner. Akagi: Wh-What?! Tsumugi: Shuuji-kun... I'm sorry... Shuuji: It was the taste of her hidden tears of loneliness. Shuuji: But still, it's all my fault. Shuuji: Tsumugi is such a kind girl... Shuuji: How could I be stupid enough to hurt a girl this kind? Now I know what an idiot I was to agree to our deal. Shuuji: I'm so sorry for everything I've done. Shuuji: From the bottom of my heart, I love this girl more than anything. Shuuji: So I've been putting on an act too, trying to act normal in order to not worry her. Shuuji: Of course, I've been happy spending all this time with her. I've had fun. Shuuji: But that's not all there is to being human, Akagi. Akagi: Wh-What do you mean? If you're happy and enjoying life, then what more is there?! Shuuji: ...You wouldn't understand. Akagi: Humph, do you want my sympathy? I don't sympathize with humans. Akagi: Only a failure of an alp would do that. Akagi: (I'm not in the wrong! I know I'm not...) Akagi: (But my chest is aching.) Akagi: (I've never felt like this before. Not even once...) "

            "Tsumugi: So maybe Hoshina-kun's subconscious is reluctant to let go of them. That might be why I'm not getting any back. Meguru: Yeah... Sorry for kinda making you comfort me... Nene: Whatever the case, try not to feel so useless. Nene: There's no doubt all the fragments we've gotten back so far are thanks to the, umm... p-power of your love. Meguru: Ah... Nene-senpaaai! Touko: Lost in thought, huh? Shuuji: Ah... Hey there, Togakushi-senpai. Touko: Can't bear to face Inaba-san? Shuuji: No, that's not it... Touko: Alrighty. Well then, let your big sis here lend you an ear. Touko: Talking to someone might help you sort out your thoughts, no matter who it is. Shuuji: ...Thank you. Touko: It makes sense that you'd be worried about the hole in your heart, given that you were born with that magic of yours. Shuuji: Right... I mean, I still don't really understand much about it. Touko: Yeah, and it's not like you got it because you wanted it. Shuuji: ...But it's true that my ability is what allowed me to start dating Meguru, so I don't hate it anymore. Touko: That's good. There's no point in hating it, so that's for the best. Shuuji: Right. I realize that my ability is a part of who I am, and Meguru loves me along with it. Touko: Ohh, what an awesome thing to say. You looked really cool there. Shuuji: Thank you... But, how do I put it... Touko: Hm? Shuuji: Meguru seems desperate to fill the hole in my heart... which only makes me feel worse about the situation. Touko: Say, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Yeah...? Touko: Magic is granted to people with wishes they want fulfilled, yeah? Shuuji: That's what I've heard. I don't know what Ayachi-san and Shiiba-san's wishes are, though. Touko: I see. But... Touko: ...What about your magic? Shuuji: Huh? Touko: Well, you have magic too, right? Shuuji: Yeah, but I just inherited it from my mom. Touko: But from what I've heard, your magic is similar but different. Shuuji: Well... Yeah... Touko: So I'm wondering why you have it. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: ...... Touko: Hm? Shuuji: Thank you. Touko: Don't thank me. I was just thinking aloud a little. Shuuji: Still. Shuuji: Meguru, sorry! Meguru: What?! Meguru: Umm, what is it...? Shuuji: I have to go now. There's somewhere I gotta go today. Meguru: O-Okay... Meguru: A-Alright then, Senpai. Umm... See you tomorrow! Shuuji: Yeah, see you tomorrow. Meguru: ...... Shuuji: Hello. Thanks again for the help a while back. I'm wondering, can you spare another moment for me? Nanao: Hmm... Okay. I'll close the cafe. Shuuji: Huh? Nanao: You've come here looking for help with something, right? Have a seat here and wait a moment. Shuuji: ...Thank you. Shuuji: ...What do you think, Souma-san? Nanao: I figured you might come to me with those questions one day... Which is why I've given them a lot of thought myself. Shuuji: I'd really appreciate it. Nanao: A witch may be gathering other people's heart fragments, but those are just the ingredients. The magic is formed according to the contractor's own wish and feelings. Nanao: So yes, it exists to fulfill their wish. Nanao: And like I told you before, there is no doubt that the ability you possess is magical in nature. Shuuji: ...But it's not like I got this ability because I was trying to fulfill some wish. Shuuji: ...Right. Nanao: And since it's magic, it also has a purpose that goes along with it. Nanao: Both you and your mother should have different purposes. Nanao: Your magic and hers are similar, but not the same. You possess your own magic. Shuuji: Which means my ability must have some kind of purpose... Shuuji: But, still― Nanao: I have a question I'd like to ask you first. Shuuji: Ah, s-sure. Nanao: Correct me if I'm wrong, but is it possible that you've been sensing the emotions of everyone other than Meguru less lately? Shuuji: Um... Yeah. I have been. Nanao: So then... Nanao: Doesn't that mean that a degree of directionality or selectivity has developed for your ability? Nanao: Basically, it's becoming possible for you to control it. Shuuji: ...... Nanao: How you absorbed the Meguru's fragments a while back is another example. Nanao: You were present for several other occasions where fragments were collected, but that was the only time you absorbed them during the collection process. Nanao: Don't you think the reason for that lies within you? Not that you did this intentionally, of course. Shuuji: So I've become able to control my ability... Nanao: ...Your magic is an extremely unusual case. Nanao: But nonetheless, it is still magic. So what this all comes down to is... Nanao: What is it you really wish for? The answer to that question is the key to everything. Shuuji: What I wish for... Nanao: Maybe your heart is waiting for you to find the answer to that question. Nanao: Maybe you're subconsciously aware that such an answer exists. Shuuji: ...... Nanao: Have a sip of coffee. Shuuji: ...Yeah, good idea. Nanao: Glad to hear that. Nanao: ...It's said that we evolved a sense of taste in order to judge whether something is dangerous or okay to eat. Shuuji: O-Okay? Nanao: However, humans have no need for that anymore. Instead, they only use it for enjoying the taste of food. Nanao: People living in this day and age never even think about the original purpose of their taste buds anymore. Shuuji: ...... Nanao: But that purpose is clear and immutable. Nanao: You have it to protect your very life. "

Akagi: I don't understand much about friendship, but it's something humans value, is it not? And Chihoko has lost her only one.

Touko: I'm trying to liven things up, but I'm the only one talking. Meguru: ...I'm sorry. Touko: Ooh, you actually said something! Though, I'm still not sure how I'm supposed to make this more fun for us. Touko: But I'll try my best. You can talk to me about anything, and I won't say a word to anyone. Give it a shot!

Meguru: Why Nene-senpai and Tsumugi-senpai? Why didn't he ask me? Touko: Hmm... Meguru: And it seemed like the same thing happened yesterday. I just... Touko: Hmm... Can I ask you one question? Meguru: Ah, y-yeah. What is it? Touko: You're talking about Hoshina-kun, right? Meguru: ...? Well, yeah. Touko: Right, thought so. But...

You know that place I brought you to before? Shuuji: They're there, at the Schwarze Katze. Touko: Oh yeah, that cafe. Their parfaits are wonderful. Shuuji: Anyway, Meguru! Meguru: Huh?! Y-Yeah! Shuuji: Sorry, I was in such a rush... I should have called you on the way here or asked Ayachi-san and Shiiba-san to do so... Shuuji: Anyway! That doesn't matter since you're still here.

I don't want to keep secrets anymore. Touko: Alrighty. I shall accompany you. Meguru: Umm, hey, so, Senpai! What is this― Shuuji: Sorry, Meguru. I need apologize in advance. Meguru: Huh?! Wh-What the heck is happening?! Shuuji: I'll explain later. Just come with me! Shuuji: We've found out what happened to Kizuki-san! Meguru: Huh? Chi-chan...? Nene: ―And that about covers it. Magic is real, and we are witches. Nene: You need to know these things, or else you'll find it hard to comprehend what we're about to talk about. Nene: I know this must be sudden, but please accept it for now. Meguru: O-Okay...? Meguru: Oh, well, umm... This doesn't seem like the kind of thing you can go around telling people willy-nilly, so umm, like... I don't really mind. Meguru: Actually, I feel kinda bad because I'm not sure I'm really following all this... Nene: I can explain any of the finer details you don't understand later. Nene: Togakushi-senpai, the same goes for you. Touko: Gotcha. I'm already grateful enough to be included in this.  Meguru: ...S-So, umm! Meguru: Senpai, you said you found out about Chi-chan... Shuuji: Yeah... We actually found someone who knows Kizuki-san. Shuuji: Akagi, can you take it from here? Akagi: Of course. Akagi: Rest assured, I'm not as young as I look. I am much older than you and Chihoko. Akagi: ...So you're Meguru, huh? My name is Akagi. I have heard a lot about you from Chihoko. Akagi: Mainly that you were her one and only friend. Her best friend. Meguru: ......!! Meguru: P-Please! Please tell me about Chi-chan! Akagi: In due time. Let us sit down, first. Meguru: Okay! Akagi: Also... Hey, I want my milk! Meguru: A-A glass of milk, please! Akagi: Haha... I had already ordered the milk, lass. Meguru: ...Huh? What the heck is \"milk glass\"? Shuuji: No, she said \"lass.\" She doesn't talk like a normal girl. Just think of her as your typical unaging loli. Meguru: ...Oh yeah! I see those in games and stuff all the time. Makes sense. Meguru: Ahaha... Milk is fine for me too. Akagi: Excellent choice. Matching drinks for the who share a bond with Chihoko. Akagi: Indeed, I can. I shall explain everything from the beginning. Meguru: What...? Akagi: That is, she was a witch. She had a wish that she wanted more than anything. Akagi: And so we formed a contract to fulfill that wish, thus making Chihoko my witch. Akagi: ...Meguru, do you understand everything so far? Meguru: Yeah... Meguru: I had no idea Chi-chan was a witch... Akagi: Your surprise is only natural. Witches tend not to talk about magic to those unrelated to our craft. Akagi: But it is different now; you have already been informed about us. Hence, I'm able to tell you now. It was necessary in order explain her current situation. Tsumugi: Actually I didn't know about that either. Tsumugi: You never told me that you made a contract with Chihoko-chan while you already had a contract with me... Shuuji: Oh, yeah... I guess that would've had to have been the case. Akagi: It's not as if I did anything wrong. There is no rule that says alps can only have one contractor. Nanao: Don't act like that's normal. We usually don't have more than one witch at a time. Shuuji: A-Anyway... Akagi, Shiiba-san was already your witch at the time? Akagi: Correct. Shuuji: Then why did you form a contract with Kizuki-san? Shuuji: Meguru, Kizuki-san used to live around here, right? Meguru: Y-Yeah. Chi-chan's place was about a 10-minute walk from my house. Akagi: I had no special reason. The girl vacationed in the town where I and Tsumugi were. She and I got to know each other, and then we exchanged a contract. That is all. Akagi: And so, for a time, I occasionally visited this town to check in on her. Akagi: But, well... because of that, there may have been a minor territorial dispute with that cat over there. Nanao: I don't want to hear it, bird. This is why I can't deal with winged creatures. Nanao: You put me through a lot, back then. Akagi: But I'll actually go crazy if I don't travel every once in a while. Maybe because I used to be a migratory bird. A cat wouldn't understand. Nanao: Oh well, it's all in the past. I don't want to start a fight in front of Nene. Akagi: Good. But we digress. Akagi: Getting back on topic... I assume you wish to know what happened to Chihoko after that? Meguru: Y-Yeah! I do! Akagi: Then I shall tell you. Where should I start... Akagi: Chihoko started gathering fragments shortly after becoming my witch. Akagi: But this was more difficult for her than most other witches. Akagi: After all, the emotional price she had to pay was an unusually harsh one... Akagi: And to make matters worse, I was only occasionally around. I couldn't offer my support around the clock.  Akagi: However, despite the obstacles set before her, she cleared them all and completed her magic. Akagi: She was just that desperate to complete her wish. Akagi: It shows how important that wish was to her. Meguru: What was it... that Chi-chan had wished for? Akagi: ...... Akagi: \"I want you to cure Megu-chan's disease.\" Meguru: ...... Meguru: I've never had any disease that― Akagi: I thought so. I had a feeling this would be the case. Akagi: Chihoko's departure must have been a tremendous shock that left you scarred. Akagi: But your body, on the other hand, seems as healthy as can be. Meguru: Wait! Wait a moment... I can't deny the part about the hole in my heart, but... Meguru: It wasn't me who was sickly, but Chi-chan... Akagi: ...While Chihoko was a quiet and slender girl, she didn't have any serious illnesses. Akagi: The tremendous shock must have jumbled up your memories.  Meguru: ...... Akagi: Or perhaps having your body cured overnight caused your brain to process it that way in order to keep things logically consistent. Akagi: Either way, it was you who had been suffering from an incurable illness. I had heard so from none other than Chihoko herself. Akagi: She told me that, due to your weak body, you stayed at home most days reading books.  Meguru: Ah... Akagi: She also told me that you often played video games together. You're quite good at them, are you not? Meguru: ...I-I guess. Akagi: But I also need to talk about the price she paid in order to see that wish fulfilled. Akagi: For that price is what had caused your separation. Meguru: Wh-What kind of price was it? Akagi: Listen well. The number of fragments required fulfill her wish was excessive, perhaps due to the strength of the disease you were afflicted with. Akagi: And on that same token, the emotional price she had to pay was unusually heavy. Akagi: For instance... Tsumugi. The price you're paying is also harsh, but the worst that can happen is some nausea, and you're otherwise fine as long as you dress in men's clothes, correct? Tsumugi: Y-Yeah, right. It's pretty harsh for me personally, but there's no danger involved or anything... Akagi: ...But it wasn't the same for Chihoko. Akagi: There was no way to fully avoid her price, and no loopholes to avoid triggering it. Akagi: It was the kind of price that came with permanent consequences. Consequences that would last even after her wish was fulfilled. Akagi: And that was the issue... Meguru: I can't take this anymore. Just tell me already! What happened to Chi-chan?! Akagi: The price she paid was... Akagi: Forgetting anyone she was close to. Meguru: Ah... Akagi: Don't complain to me. No one can predict the kind of price you'll get in advance. Akagi: That was simply the price she got. That's all there is to say. Meguru: Then, Chi-chan... Akagi: ...Needless to say, she was stunned when she first learned of her price. And at first, she blamed me heavily for it. Akagi: However, she quickly resolved herself. Akagi: In order to avoid causing needless distress, she proceeded to gradually distance herself and cut ties from everyone she knew. Akagi: Yet she couldn't bring herself to do the same for you. Akagi: Even though she would eventually forget you as well... she endured that fear and remained by your side. Meguru: B-But why... Why would she go so far? Akagi: Well, because you were her best friend. Meguru: ...... Akagi: She told me this... Akagi: \"Megu-chan is actually a very cheerful girl. She's a wonderful person that anyone could come to love.\" Akagi: \"I'm really bad at making friends and only have Megu-chan, but deep down, she's different.\" Akagi: \"And to think she told me I'm her one and only friend. Her best friend in the whole world.\" Akagi: \"She said that as long as she has me, she doesn't need other friends.\" Akagi: \"Hearing that made me so very happy...\" Akagi: \"And so... I want to thank her.\" Akagi: \"I want to repay Megu-chan somehow.\" Akagi: \"I want to make the friend I'm so proud of be able to cheerfully run around outside.\" Akagi: \"I want her to be loved by everyone in her class.\" Akagi: \"Even if I end up forgetting about her...\" Akagi: \"...I want to help her become able to face life without me.\" Akagi: \"And to achieve that, I want to complete our contract and cure her disease.\" Meguru: ...... Akagi: The first to be forgotten was her parents. Akagi: They were beyond startled. They talked about medical examinations and surgery. They eventually decided to move somewhere far away for their daughter to live. Akagi: And then... At the very end, she even forgot her precious friend. The one her magic was meant for in the first place. Akagi: As a result... you ended up suddenly losing your best friend. Akagi: The lack of farewells was only natural. Chihoko had lost her memory of you by that point. Akagi: That was when her parents cut all ties to their life here and moved away with their daughter... Tsumugi: So that's what happened... Nene: That's why the school didn't have any records... Touko: ...You really don't where she went? Not even you? Akagi: No. I have no idea where she is living currently. Akagi: It is probably for the best to not look for her. I have no intention of doing that either. Akagi: It would likely only bother her and her parents and possibly even cause her undue stress. Meguru: So then... She's just... Shuuji: Kh... Akagi: Meguru, do you understand what that means? Meguru: Well... Meguru: Chi-chan cured my disease, but in exchange, she doesn't remember me anymore... Akagi: That's right! But to do that... Akagi: ...She saw it through to the end, even after she had already forgotten about you. Meguru: Ahh...! Akagi: Even I was surprised by that. Akagi: She really didn't remember you anymore. Akagi: But she told me that she could tell how important this was to do. Akagi: That by doing this, she was sure her wish would come true. Akagi: Despite the fact that she didn't even remember who that wish would cure anymore. Akagi: At the very end, she even forgot me. And yet, she still saw it through. Akagi: ...Chihoko was an amazing human. She said that she wanted this to serve as her farewell. Akagi: She may have forgotten you... But the magic she brought to life in exchange was literally Chihoko herself. Akagi: And that magic is now living on in your heart, Meguru. Meguru: Ah, aah... Meguru: Yeah...! Meguru: Senpai...! Akagi: That's right. Meguru: Thanks to Chi-chan... I... Meguru: I never left her thoughts... Meguru: My good health was Chi-chan's last gift to me. Meguru: It's Chi-chan's memories that are giving me life! Meguru: I...! I had never lost my best friend! Meguru: I haven't been able to do anything for Chi-chan! Meguru: It's so painful... I don't know how I can possibly repay Chi-chan for all she's done. Akagi: ...Let me tell you something here and now, Meguru. Akagi: I'm sure you were but an empty shell after losing Chihoko. Meguru: Y-Yeah... Akagi: But the girl I see today isn't just healthy. Akagi: She's surrounded by many friends. You're loved dearly. Everyone you see here now is giving you their full support, are they not? Meguru: Akagi... Akagi: Furthermore, I was honestly taken aback when I saw you today. Akagi: You are nothing like the child Chihoko described to me. You have a serious sense of fashion and, how should I put this... You're a real looker. Meguru: I'm dressing like this because... Akagi: You needn't say it. Both I and Chihoko know. Akagi: You recovered and got back on your feet because you knew that you couldn't let things continue as they had been, am I right? Meguru: Ah... Akagi: I am positive that was what Chihoko was truly wishing for. So rest assured! Akagi: For you have fulfilled Chihoko's wish as well. Meguru: ～～～～! Meguru: Waaaaaaah! Meguru: I'll do my best! I'll live strong for you! Meguru: You don't have to worry anymore... I'm strong now. Meguru: Wahh... Waaaaaah! "

I bet that a lot of the time, they've already made up their mind and just want some encouragement. Shuuji: This is probably a good thing, considering the time of the year.

I don't want to think about it. Tsumugi: That reaction tells me everything. You really need to study more. Meguru: Ugh... Shuuji: All club activities will be put on a mandatory break starting next week as midterms near. You should have plenty of time to study.  Meguru: I wouldn't be having this problem in the first place if all I needed was time to study. Shuuji: I know where you're coming from, but you're only hurting yourself by not studying.

            "Shuuji: Oh, that's great. Nanao: And also, Hoshina-kun, this is unexpected, but― Shuuji: What is it?! Is there another problem?! Nanao: Your magic has been erased too. Shuuji: ...Huh? You mean... Nanao: Your magic overflowed as well, allowing you to interfere with Togakushi-san's heart, correct? And your magic power was weak to begin with. Nanao: A large excess of magic flowed into you. Your power was temporarily enhanced but rendered you unable to control it, which resulted in your magic being completely erased. Shuuji: Then, that means... Nanao: You no longer have the power to sense people's emotions. Shuuji: Really...? Nanao: ...... Nanao: I know you said that you don't think you can socialize well without your power, but try not to be so anxious, okay? Shuuji: Honestly... I don't really know how what's going to happen from here out. Shuuji: Life might get more difficult for me, but I'll cross that bridge when I come to it. Shuuji: This is a fresh start for me. I'm just going to focus on being with Touko-san. Nanao: ...I see. Hehe. Nanao: This has been a good experience for me too. I've always been focused on learning more about humans and becoming one. Nanao: It seems there are things far more important than knowledge if you are to live as a human, however. There's a lot more left for me to research. Shuuji: I've learned some new things too. Shuuji: The reason my mom wanted her magic so badly was all because of one person. I never would've thought... I'm shocked, to be honest. Nanao: Oh, there's one more thing I should tell you, Hoshina-kun... Shuuji: Yeah? Shuuji: I'm so sorry! Nene: Huh? What? U-Umm... What are you sorry about? Shuuji: Well, you know how I took all that magic from you? Souma-san says it's all been erased from inside me. Shuuji: We think it reacted to my emotions and was used up as my own magic power. I'm so, so sorry! Nene: Ah, that's what you mean. You made me think something bad happened. Shuuji: ...Umm, you're not angry? Nene: Would being angry get me my magic back? Shuuji: Oh, uh, well... Nene: Hehe, I'm sorry. That was a mean question. I was just joking. Nene: I'm not angry. I'm just happy that Togakushi-senpai has woken up again. It's no problem at all. Shuuji: Ayachi-san... Nene: And hey. Take a look at this. Shuuji: Really? Nene: You didn't use them all up, Hoshina-kun. You only used a portion. The rest came back here. Nene: Just because you don't have to worry about Togakushi-senpai anymore, it doesn't mean you have to worry about me. Shuuji: But that still means I used up part of your magic. Nene: That's offset by what I've gained since you started helping out with the club. Actually, the number of fragments I have now is only a little lower than when I first met you. Nene: But please, you don't have to worry about me. A lot has happened, but how about we call it even? Shuuji: ...Sure, let's do that. Shuuji: I'm going to keep working at the OC though, even if I don't have anything to make up to you. Nene: Of course. You're more than welcome to. Meguru: Of course there is. We were so worried about you! You were gone for days. Touko: ...Sorry for worrying you so much. Touko: Oh, and thank you for the shawl. It's so cute. I just love it. Meguru: I'm glad you like it, but it's a present from everyone. Tsumugi: But you were the one who decided we should buy her a shawl and picked it out, Meguru-chan. Touko: You have such good taste, Inaba-san. Meguru: Y-You think? Ehehe... Meguru: Hey, today's not about me! We're here to celebrate Togakushi-senpai's return. Nene: That's right. Nene: Speaking of which, I brought some cake. Touko: You did? Shuuji: It came from a great shop that Inaba-san told us about. Meguru: Well, originally a friend from my class told me about it. It's all the rage. Nene: So we asked Hisashima-sensei to let us keep it cool in the staff fridge. Touko: I'm not sure this is something students are allowed to do... But I suppose it's fine for today! Meguru: Yeah! Tsumugi: This is a celebration, after all. Nene: Togakushi-senpai, what's your favorite kind of cake? Touko: I wonder... What do you have? Wow, these all look great! Hmm, I don't know which to go for... Shuuji: ...... Meguru, Tsumugi: ...... Touko: Huh? What is it? Oh, did someone call dibs on the gateau chocolat? Meguru: No, that's not the problem. Tsumugi: Togakushi-senpai, you seem kinda... cheerful? Not that you were gloomy before, but... Meguru: You're more excitable than usual. Not that that's a bad thing. It's super cool that you're happy. Nene: Hoshina-kun, what kind would you like? Shuuji: Oh, I'm good with whatever. You guys pick first. Meguru: Well then... Can I take the shortcake? Tsumugi: Yeah, that's fine. I'll go for... the cheesecake. Nene: I'll have the fruit tart. Touko: That leaves you with the mille-feuille, Shuu-kun. Here. Shuuji: Thank you very much. Shuuji: One more time then. Touko-san... Nene, Tsumugi, Meguru, Shuuji: Congratulations on your recovery! Touko: Yeah! Thanks, everyone. I'm glad to be back. Shuuji: Thanks, Inaba-san. Meguru: Let me guess... You guys spent all day today sucking face to make up for all that lost time? Touko: I-I can't answer that! Touko: ...... Nene, Tsumugi, Meguru: ...... Meguru: I don't know what to say... I didn't expect you to take that seriously. Tsumugi: I thought you'd just smile and go, \"mufufu, that's a secret.\" Nene: Didn't I tell them to refrain from doing that at school? Meguru: Now, now. They're two young lovebirds who've finally reunited. Who are we to stop them? Ehehe... Shuuji: Inaba-san, a girl shouldn't laugh like that. You sound like a dirty old man. Meguru: How dare you! I'm an innocent young maiden! Shuuji: If you're as innocent as you claim, then act like it! Tsumugi: But... You know, you've changed a bit, Togakushi-senpai. Touko: Yeah, I was thinking that I feel a bit different... I've been feeling more restless than usual. Tsumugi: Is that a bad thing? Touko: No. I feel restless, but... it's not all that bad. It makes being with you all even more fun. A-And... Touko: It means I love Shuu-kun even more than before. It's such a happy feeling. Shuuji: ...I'm really happy too. Touko: ...... Shuuji: ...... Touko, Shuuji: Hehehe.\nAhaha. Meguru: ...The cake was more than sweet enough, you two. Tsumugi: Hey now, we should be happy for them. Nene: Just please don't start kissing here. I'll get angry if you do. Shuuji: You really think I'd have the courage to do that here? Nene: Well, that's good then. Meguru: I'm sure that they'll be slobbering all over each other the moment we leave them alone. Shuuji: No we won't! Touko: Y-Yeah. There's no way we could kiss in front of other people. Sheesh. Meguru: That didn't seem to be a problem for you before... Tsumugi: Anyway, come on. Let's eat all this cake before someone comes in to talk to us. Nene: You're right. We should eat up before someone walks in on us... But let's try to savor it. Touko: ...? What is it? Shuuji: Oh, nothing really. Anyway, Touko-san. Touko: Hmm? Yeah? Shuuji: I just remembered... I haven't fulfilled my promise. Touko: What promise? Shuuji: You know, the promise to get you a present. You haven't forgotten, have you? Touko: Ah... You did promise that, didn't you? Back in the clubroom the day I collapsed. You said you'd buy me clothes to commemorate us going out. Shuuji: See? You do remember. Think we can do that over the weekend? Touko: Huh? O-Over the weekend? As in, this upcoming one? Shuuji: Is that a problem? Touko: It's not that I don't want to, but, um... I have a lot to do in preparation. The timing just isn't good, so... Shuuji: Well if you have stuff to do... I guess we'll just have to go another time. Touko: Geez. I told you not to give me those puppy-dog eyes. Touko: Anyway, I want to go on a date with you too, so... Shuuji: Is that a yes? Touko: Y-Yeah... Fine. I'll just have to go about this another way. I've got some studying to do! Shuuji: ...Studying?

            "Nene: Not every day is active here. Tsumugi: It's getting kind of late, so maybe we should all head home. Nene: Good idea. Meguru: Nene-senpai, Tsumugi-senpai, let's go home together. Tsumugi: Yeah, sounds good. Nene: Okay, if you don't mind me parting ways soon after leaving. Meguru: Of course not. Well then... Tsumugi: We should tidy up before heading home. Nene: You two can leave before us if you like. Shuuji: No, we can't do that. Touko: He's right. We can't just leave early because we're dating. It wouldn't be right. Nene: Don't worry about us, please. All we really have to do is make sure everything's locked up. Tsumugi: You two have plans anyway, don't you? Shuuji: Wh-Why would you... Meguru: Well, you've been restless this whole time, Senpai. You've just been spacing out and glancing at the clock over and over again. You're so easy to read. Nene: Even I could tell. Shuuji: Gah... Touko: Ah... You could tell? Tsumugi: Yes. You were murmuring to yourself too, but I couldn't make it out. Touko: I didn't mean to... but I guess I did. Sorry about that. Nene: No, don't worry about it today. Nobody came to ask for our help, or even to have their fortune told. Meguru: Actually, having the two of you here sometimes makes the rest of us uncomfortable. Meguru: So please just go on your date or whatever and get out of our hair. That's the only the help we need. Touko: Yeah, sounds good to me. Touko: Sorry, everyone, but we're taking off now. Nene: Okay, see you later. Tsumugi: Bye-bye. Meguru: See ya Monday. Shuuji: Bye! Shuuji: Yeah. But they're just trying to look out for us, so we shouldn't worry about it. Shuuji: We'll just have to be careful not to let this happen again. Touko: Yeah, you're right. Let's save the worrying for later and have a wonderful time together tonight. Shuuji: Y-Yeah?! Shuuji: N-No, nothing at all. Touko: Really? Well, okay then... Oh, right. What should I make today, Hoshina-kun? I've been thinking about it all day, but I haven't come up with anything. Shuuji: Is that what you were thinking about in the club room? Touko: Yeah. Is there anything you'd like to eat? Shuuji: Let's see... Touko: Is that what you want? I'm fine with it, but... Shuuji: Yeah. I barely ever make it myself. Touko: Really? Shuuji: I normally just combine chicken and eggs with rice and put it in a bowl. I'd like to taste your omelet rice. Touko: I see. Okay then. I'm happy to make that for you. Omelet rice for dinner, it is! Shuuji: Great, thanks. Touko: But doesn't saying \"I'd like to taste your omelet\" sound kinda indecent to you? That's a total double entendre. Shuuji: No? There's no way that could be! Touko: Huh, really? Maybe I was overthinking it... Hmm... Touko: Yeah, we do. Oh, that reminds me. What about your dad? Shuuji: My dad says he'll be working late today and will eat out, so you don't have to worry about him. Touko: Okay, okay. Then what we need is... Shuuji: Yup, and we have some butter left over too. Touko: Do you prefer your eggs firm or a little runny? Shuuji: I'm fine with either. Today I just want to eat the kind of food you'd make for yourself. Touko: Okay, so a little runny it is. Which means... We'll need to buy some fresh cream. Touko: Dear, oh dear... Touko: It's fine, I'll do it. This is just part of making dinner. You go and get changed. Shuuji: But, Senpai― Touko: There's no point in you standing around here in your uniform. You'll be more comfortable after you've changed and it'll make the food taste even better. Shuuji: How would my clothes change the taste of the food? Touko: You have much to learn. The condition a person is in affects how good food tastes, you know? Like, food doesn't taste as good when you're sick, does it? Shuuji: Well, yeah, but you're sick... Touko: I'm the one making this and I want it to be perfect. Now, go get changed and I'll clean things up here. Shuuji: ...Okay, I'm sorry. I'll go and get changed now. Touko: Great. Go ahead and take your time. And don't worry, I won't peep. Mufufu. Shuuji: You saying that only makes me more worried. Touko: Mine's in my bag. Hoshina-kun's should be... Oh, there's his bag. I'm sure he won't mind if I... Shuuji: ...Done. Touko: Hoshina-kun, we need to talk. Please sit right here. Shuuji: Here? Touko: ...Please sit with me. Shuuji: ...Okay. Touko: There's something I have to apologize to you for. Shuuji: Huh? Surely, I should be the one apologizing for leaving you here alone in my kitchen. What's there for you to apologize about? Touko: While I was washing the frying pans earlier, I thought I should also wash our lunch boxes. So I went through your bag without permission. I'm sorry. Shuuji: Oh, you didn't have to do that... I could have at least washed the lunch boxes. Shuuji: And I don't think you need to sit me down and apologize for opening my bag... Shuuji: %130;...Wait, you opened my bag?! Shuuji: *gulp* Touko: While I do apologize for going through your bag without permission, this is what I found inside it. Shuuji: ...... Touko: Did you plan on watching it? I assume that's why you have it. Shuuji: Oh, no... Well, I mean... Touko: Alone, after I'd gone home? Shuuji: ...That's right. Touko: Hoshina-kun! Shuuji: Y-Yes ma'am! Touko: Why would you do that?! Shuuji: Well, errm, I am a guy, and, as embarrassing as it is... when I'm alone, I do have certain urges that must be dealt with... Touko: I don't care about you masturbating! Touko: Why were you going to watch this alone?! Shuuji: ...Huh? I mean, uh... Touko: We promised to study together! Why wouldn't you ask me to join you?! Shuuji: ...... Touko: Huh? Why would I be? It's normal for guys to have, isn't it? Touko: I don't mind that one bit. It's not like this is one of those disgusting loli ones. Shuuji: Then... what are you angry about? Touko: As I said, it's because you were trying to leave me out and watch this alone! Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Huh? R-Right, we did. We sure did promise that. Touko: But you were planning to watch this naughty video alone, weren't you? Wouldn't getting some extra studying in on your own go against our promise? Shuuji: Y-Yeah... I guess you could see it like that? Touko: I'm right, aren't I? You were planning on watching this alone to get in some secret studying. Touko: Even though you know how much I want to study this subject... That's not fair! Shuuji: What's not fair?! Shuuji: I wasn't trying to break our promise here! Touko: Really? Shuuji: Really. I mean it. Touko: *stare* Shuuji: I'm serious. Touko: You weren't planning on studying alone? Shuuji: No. You've misunderstood. Touko: Shall we watch this DVD together? Shuuji: What?! Wh-Why would we do that?! Touko: If we watch it together, you'll get to watch it, and you won't have to break our promise. It's a win-win situation. The perfect idea! Shuuji: Why are you smiling so much?! Touko: Huh? Are you saying we can't? Shuuji: It's more like... I'm not that into shame-play like that... Touko: I'm not saying this as a joke, you know? Shuuji: Yeah? And? Touko: Well... You know, most manga show up to the kiss, which is also all that movie the other day went up to, right? Shuuji: Well, yeah. Shuuji: Yeah... You have a point, I guess... Touko: But I've never actually seen it. Oh, though I have seen a girl's genitals, since I have them and all. Shuuji: Umm... You don't have to be quite so descriptive. Touko: You don't have any experience with this either, do you? Shuuji: ...N-No, I don't. Touko: Well, it's at times like this the older girl has to take the lead. This is something I've been worrying about a lot, lately. Touko: But I've hit a dead end. If you'd just showed me the DVD... In fact, if I'd just been honest with you in the first place, we could have already studied it together. Touko: So, basically, let's watch this porno together! Shuuji: Please don't say that while smiling so innocently. AV: Ah, mm! Ah, ah, ah, ahh! Yes, your cock is amazing! Haa, haa, haa, nnn! Touko: Ooh... So this is sex... This is something else. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Huh? Oh, err, I dunno, really? I've only seen videos of it... Shuuji: I think it depends on the person... They probably exaggerate it a bit for porn. Touko: I see... This is acting... Is that face she's making acting too? Touko: It's rather incredible... Is this what they call an o-face? Shuuji: %130;Pffffffft! Touko: It isn't? I don't really know the details, but don't you have to make that face the whole time you're having sex? Isn't that just common courtesy? Touko: I wonder if it's like this. Shuuji: Whoa, you don't have to do it! You really don't have to do it! Touko: Huh, really? Shuuji: That face is one you're meant to make naturally at, like, a special moment. You don't need to worry about it. Touko: Really? I don't? Phew, that's a relief. I was worried about getting the face wrong and you hating me for it. Shuuji: There are way more important things to worry about! Touko: So, when are you meant to do the double peace signs? The girl here hasn't done that at all yet. Shuuji: Nobody ever does that, either! Touko: Then I don't have to do it? Shuuji: No! You don't! Shuuji: No, I'm pretty sure there's more... Touko: Ah, you're right. Next is... Whoa, in between the boobs? Is this what they a call boobjob? Shuuji: I-It is... Touko: Well... Not really, no. This is for a special reason, and I wanted to do it. What about you, Hoshina-kun? Are you embarrassed? Shuuji: Incredibly! I was against us watching this together from the start! Touko: Oh yeah. Why don't you want to do this? Shuuji: Because this is something you're meant to enjoy in private... Like, without other people knowing. Shuuji: It's really uncomfortable to watch this with someone else. I can't settle down. Touko: You can't settle down? Oh... Does that mean you're struggling to hold yourself back? Well, don't mind me. Feel free to do as you normally would. Shuuji: %130;Like hell I can do that! Shuuji: I'm not into masturbating in front of people. Especially not you, Senpai! Touko: Really? Shuuji: ...But you're still planning on watching the video to learn more, aren't you? Touko: Actually, I only have more questions after watching this. Shuuji: Such as? Touko: Do boobjobs feel good? Shuuji: I-I dunno. I couldn't say. I've never gotten one before... Touko: But guys really want them, right? So then, Hoshina-kun... do you also want one? Shuuji: Oh, well... I suppose I'd like to experience one someday. Shuuji: ...... Touko: Would you like to try it out? Shuuji: Huh? Touko: Would you like to try it out... with my boobs? Shuuji: Senpai?! Touko: Mm... *kiss* *kiss* *kiss* Mmpah, mm, mmmph! Shuuji: Can I take your shirt off, Senpai? Touko: Ah, okay... Shuuji: Could you raise your arms up for me? Touko: Mm... Shuuji: I'm nervous thinking about what's coming up too. Touko: You're staring so much. It's so embarrassing, ahaha... Shuuji: So beautiful... Touko: Are you talking about my bra? Or my boobs? Shuuji: Everything. Your bra, your boobs, your fair skin... it's all beautiful. I don't know what to say. I wish I could stare at them forever. Touko: Oh, thanks... But we'll never get anywhere if you only ever stare at them. Shuuji: Y-You're right. Th-Then... excuse me. Shuuji: Oh, sorry. I'll stop. Touko: You do? That's great. Shuuji: W-Well then... I'm taking off your bra. Touko: Okay... Mm, mmm... Th-This kind of tickles. Shuuji: Sorry. This will just take a moment... Shuuji: Oh, no, it's fine. Touko: Do you prefer doing it with clothes on? You big pervert, you. Mufufu. Touko: Yeah. But please be gentle. Shuuji: I-I will. Of course. Touko: Mm, ah... I'm nervous too. A boy is fondling my breasts for the first time... Touko: I-Is everything okay? My boobs aren't weird, are they? Shuuji: Not even a little. They're so big and soft. I don't know if I'll be able to stop fondling them. I love your boobs, Senpai. Touko: Ahn, mm... J-Just my boobs? *pant* *pant* Mmm! Shuuji: Allow me to rephrase. I love everything about you, Senpai. You're so cute. There's nothing weird about any part of you. Shuuji: Sorry, but I can't hold back. Shuuji: That's fine. The woman in the porno did it too. Touko: Mm, she did, but... Hearing them come from me is so embarrassing that I can hardly stand it.  Shuuji: Oh, is that so? Shuuji: Your nipples are getting harder, Senpai. That's not because you're cold, is it? Touko: Nnahh, nn, nnngh... N-No. My chest feels like it's on fire. *pant* *pant* Shuuji: I don't know what you're talking about. Shuuji: I'm really not meaning to! You're just so cute and your boobs are so amazing that I'm getting carried away a little. Touko: Sheesh. That's enough fondling of my boobs. Shuuji: Huh?! What?! Touko: Weren't we going to do something a little different? Shuuji: Well... Yeah, true. Touko: Then we should get to it. Are you all ready? Shuuji: It's embarrassing but... Yeah, of course. AV: Ahh, mm... Ahh! Ahh! Your dick milk ish sho hot... It's shooting out all over! Touko: I see, so that's how you do it. Then... I'll lie down, and you get on top of me. And then... you bring your dick out. Shuuji: ......! Touko: So this is your dick... Shuuji: Yeah, I was just thinking the same thing. Touko: And the tip of your dick is wet. Is this dick milk? Shuuji: Errm, you don't have to mimic that bit. Just refer to it normally, please? Touko: Should I? Okay, so, is this sticky stuff semen? Oh look, it's making threads. Shuuji: No, it isn't. That's, um... precum, or cowper's fluid. Just call it one of those. Touko: Ah, I know about that. This juice comes out when you're feeling good, but before you release, right? Hmm, this is... ah, it's transparent. Touko: Mm, mmm... This juice is so sticky. Ah, it's making more threads. This is getting even more indecent. Mufufu. Shuuji: Your boobs just feel that good. Ah, ah, nnngh! Touko: Really? Hehe, I'm glad... Having big boobs can be a real pain sometimes, but that pain is all worth it if you like them. I'll let you enjoy them even more. Mm, mmm, nngh... Touko: Mufufu, see? Isn't moaning embarrassing? Ah, mm, ahh, nngh! Shuuji: Y-Yeah, it is. G... Go a bit slower, Senpai. Touko: Nope. I'm going to give your dick all the love my boobs can give. Shuuji: Ngh, aaah! Shuuji: Ah, ah... Y-You're being so rough! Touko: Hey, look, your dick is getting so red between my boobs. And it's twitching too... It's so cute. Shuuji: H-Hold on, Senpai. You can't do that! It's... dirty! Touko: I don't mind. It's not dirty at all. It's adorable. *kiss* Shuuji: Nh?! Touko: I'll get as dirty as I want for you. That's normal when, mm, mmpah, you like someone... Mm. *kiss* *kiss* *kiss* Shuuji: B-But... If you kiss it like that... Touko: *kiss* *kiss* It feels good, doesn't it? Ah, are you at your limit already? Shuuji: Y-Yeah... This is bad... I'm really trying to hold back here. Shuuji: Ahh, S-Senpai, h-hold on! If you keep moving like that, then...! I said I'm gonna cum! Touko: So cum, then. Look, the guy in the video is cumming right now. Shuuji: P-Probably. Though, the white and sticky part is normal. Touko: Oh, okay... Go ahead and cum. Shoot out loads of semen. Do it just like in the video. Come on; do it. Touko: Mufufu... You say that, but you seem to be really enjoying yourself. Mm, ahh, mm, nnn... Shuuji: But one wrong move and I'll cum on the spot. Touko: Hey, aren't you going to cum? Let out all of your sticky stuff. Shuuji: Senpai, I-I... Aah! Touko: Are you cumming? Are you releasing your semen? It's okay; go ahead. Do it just like in the video. Shuuji: I-I'm gonna cum. Touko: Yeah... Hurry up and cum... Ah, ah, ah... Touko: Haah, ahh... Come on... Cum in my mouth. You can do it as much as you want, whenever you want. Ah, ahh, ahh... Haah, haah! Shuuji: Senpai! Senpai! I'm cumming! Touko: Good. Cum, and cover my face and boobs in your naughty, sticky juice. Let out all your semen... *pant* *pant* *pant* Shuuji: S-Senpai! Touko: Nhaaaah?! Touko: Mmmrph! Nngh, mmm! *gulp* Pwah! Haa, haa, mm... *pant* *pant* Touko: *kiss* *kiss* Mmm, you really did cum too much... *pant* *pant* It's like I'm drowning in semen. *pant* *pant* *kiss* Shuuji: You don't have to force yourself to drink this. Touko: The only problem is how much there is. Mm. *slurp* I like you, and I like your cum too... *lick* *gulp* *gulp* Mmmm, mpwah! Touko: Y-You will? Can you shoot again so quickly? Shuuji: Not normally, but you're just too damn sexy right now... I can't calm down. Touko: Yeah? So it's my fault. Then... I'll have to take responsibility... Mmm... *kiss* *suck* *lick* Ahh... Shuuji: S-Senpai?! Touko: It's okay. We can do this as much as you want. I like it and want to do it. I really want to keep going. So... can we? Let out another load for me. Touko: And you're really cute, Hoshina-kun. Omm! *lick* *kiss* *kiss* And you're cute down here too... *lick* *slurp*! Shuuji: Ah, ah... S-Senpai, there... Touko: Mmm, here? It's all wet again, mm... *kiss* *kiss* *slurp* Touko: Ehehe... So much naughty juice... Mmm... It's tasty. Mmph, mmm... Shuuji: Ngh, aahh! Touko: Ahh, mm, mmpah... *lick* *lick* Mmpah... Your voice is trembling. Shuuji: Your... boobs and tongue feel too good. I'm going numb. Touko: *slurp* Mmpah, ahh... *kiss* *kiss* Ahh, mmm... *lick* *lick* Mmm, your dick is trembling too. Are you about to cum again? Shuuji: Y-Yeah... I can't last much longer. Touko: Mm, okay, cum again. I'll accept it all... Mm, mmm! *kiss* *kiss* Mmpah, ahh... Come on, don't hold back. Cum! Touko: Ahh, omm... *kiss* *kiss* *slurp* Mm, mm, mm... *kiss* *slurrrp*! Mmpah, mmhaah! Touko: Are you cumming again? This is faster than the last time. *lick* Mm, mmpah, mmmph! Shuuji: It's because you haven't stopped giving me a boobjob this whole time... Ngh. Touko: Mufufu. You don't have to hold back. Cover me in your hot stuff again. *lick* *lick* *kiss* Shuuji: I will. I'm going to coat your entire face, Senpai, and prove that you belong to me. Touko: Mm, mmph, mmpah! I'm sho happy... Yesh, cover me, make me shticky, drown me in your semen! Touko: Yes, good. Cover me, cover me! *lick* *lick* Nnnhaah! Mm, mmpah, mmph... *kiss* *kiss* Shuuji: Ah, ah! I-I'm cumming! Touko: Mmm, mmgh, mmhaaaaaah! Touko: The smell is so strong, and there's so much... *gulp* *gulp* Nhaah... I love semen... *pant* *pant* Shuuji: I really made a mess of your face, Senpai... I'm sorry. Touko: You don't have to apologize. I wanted this... I'm happy you came so much. Touko: Omm! *slurp* *lick* Mmpah... *gulp* *gulp* Mm, mmph... *pant* *pant* It really is tasty. Shuuji: ...... "

            "Tsumugi: The party is finally almost here. How have things gone on your end? Shuuji: ...Don't ask. Doing so just adds more pressure. Tsumugi: Oh, okay. Sorry! Shuuji: You want me to carve some pumpkins and make jack-o'-lanterns? Nene: Yes. I'd appreciate it. Tsumugi: What about us? It might be tough for Hoshina-kun to handle that by himself. Should we help? Nene: No, carving pumpkins is tough physical work, so the boys from the Student Council will be helping with that. Meguru: Should we handle the decorations then? Nene: Yes. Togakushi-senpai and Koshiji-san are out making purchases right now. We'll start decorating the gym once they come back. Tsumugi: And in the afternoon we'll make the cookies and pudding? Nene: Yes. That's the plan. Meguru: Alright! We're in the home stretch! Let's get to it! Student Council Member A: Oh, thanks. Shuuji: Just one more jack-o'-lantern left per person. Anyway, here are some more pumpkin guts. Touko: Thank you. Shuuji: How are things going on your side? Touko: It's quite strenuous. Shuuji: Do you need more people? Touko: Nah. There are just a lot of batches we have to make. Throwing more people at the problem won't help. Touko: You know, Inaba-san is actually pretty good at cooking. She's really impressive. She's quick and her food tastes great. The guests are gonna love it. Shuuji: That sounds great. I'm expecting some great snacks from her now. Touko: Oh right. Speaking of expectations, how are things looking on your end? For your band, I mean. Shuuji: Ugh. Touko: Hm? Is something wrong? Shuuji: Yeah. The pressure is starting to get to me... Touko: You're a boy, so stop talking like a wimp. I'm expecting you to look cool up there on stage! Mufufu. Shuuji: You're just adding on even more pressure. Please stop. Touko: If just my expectations are putting that much pressure on you, how are you gonna play in front of a crowd? Man up. Shuuji: I get your point, but... I never go to events like these in the first place. Shuuji: But now I suddenly have to perform on stage? My heart is pounding like crazy. Shuuji: You don't get nervous when appearing before a crowd? Touko: Hmm... I just got used to it after a while. Touko: Oh, I know! How about this? Give yourself a reward if your performance is a success. Shuuji: Reward myself? Touko: Yup, that's right. Something like treating yourself to a fancy meal, for example. Touko: After all, motivation is important. Touko: Oh, I said \"motivation,\" okay? Not \"masturbation.\" A bad pun like that would be really unnecessary. Shuuji: You're right. It WAS totally unnecessary! Shuuji: It was fine advice. I just can't think of anything that would motivate me. Touko: Oh. Well, I'm sure it's hard to think of something on the spot. Touko: Alrighty! New plan. If you kick butt up there on stage, I'll personally give you a reward. Shuuji: You? To me? Touko: Did that maybe get you a little too motivated? Mufufu. Shuuji: I don't know if \"motivated\" is the right word... Touko: I just hope you aren't expecting anything too much, or anything sexual. Anyway, do your best up there! Touko: Alright, I should get back to work. You keep it up as well. Meguru: Tadaaa! What do you think? Meguru: Rawr! I'm gonna eat you up! Just kidding! Shuuji: Ooh, that looks great on you. Meguru: You think? I'm a little embarrassed... Ehehe. Shuuji: Not just the looks. It really fits your cheerful personality. Meguru: Thank you. Your costume looks good on you too. Shuuji: Oh, I dunno about that. There's nothing special about it. Shuuji: I guess. Meguru: Nene-senpai, you look great in your costume too. Nene: Thank you. Though, I'm not used to wearing this kind of outfit, so I'm a little nervous. Shuuji: Yeah? Shuuji: Er, it's nothing. I wasn't thinking anything weird at all.  Nene: Are you sure? Nene: Because I was pretty sure you were thinking \"you wear even more revealing clothes all the time.\" Shuuji: ...Ugh, the look you're giving me hurts. Please stop. Nene: I know... Don't remind me about how I have to dress in such a ridiculous and embarrassing outfit... Shuuji: Well, you look great in your current costume, at least. You shouldn't feel embarrassed by that. Shuuji: What's it supposed to be, though? Nene: I don't think it's supposed to be anything in particular. I think it's just a normal gothic dress. Gothic outfits are normal for Halloween. Shuuji: Yeah? That's new to me. Good to know. Nene: But... Does it really look okay? It doesn't look strange on me? Like... I didn't put it on the wrong way? It doesn't look awful on me? Shuuji: I don't think you have anything to worry about. You look great. Shuuji: I'm positive you'll draw a lot of attention in that, in a good way. You almost look too good in it. So don't worry. Nene: Yeah? Thank you... very much. Shuuji: You're welcome. "

I was off pitch because of my nervousness... Meguru: No, you were great! You got the audience fired up like crazy! Nene: I'm glad you think that way, but really, that's thanks to the whole band. Tsumugi: Kaidou-kun, Kariya-san, and Hoshina-kun were all so amazing! Wakana: Th-Thanks... It's kinda embarrassing to hear you say so. Wakana: I mean, I made a lot of mistakes... Touko: Sure, it's important to try to minimize mistakes, but your main goal was to fire up the party. I don't think you have anything to worry about there. Shuuji: Thank you. I'll take your word for it and be happy about the praise. Meguru: Good work out there, Senpai. Shuuji: Oh, thanks, Inaba-san. How'd you like it? Meguru: You kinda sucked! Shuuji: You don't pull any punches, do you? Wakana: Thanks a lot for today, Hoshina, Kaidou. And you too, Ayachi-san. Nene: Oh, no, I'm just happy to be of help. Hideaki: You're more than welcome. I had a lot of fun too. Shuuji: I should be thanking you, Kariya. Thanks for giving this your all despite how sudden it was. Wakana: No, I needed to do this and I'm glad I did. I'll always look back on this fondly. Shuuji: Yeah, me too. Meguru: Wait a minute... Why are you talking like you won't perform anymore? Meguru: I really would've liked to hear you play again. Shuuji: That's flattering, but I couldn't possibly. I'm just not cut out for this kind of thing. Hideaki: ...Small parties are great, because the bar is set so low. Shuuji: I'm guessing performing at a club is a lot tougher? Hideaki: Well... honestly, those with the most devoted fans win. Even if you really suck, you're set as long as have some followers. Shuuji: That so? Hideaki: Actually, it's not unusual to see bands who are even worse than we were. Shuuji: Huh? There are bands THAT bad? Hideaki: Sometimes, yeah. And it's also common to never draw a good crowd no matter how good you are. Hideaki: So yeah, it's honestly not that unlikely for us to find some success if we tried playing at a club. Though, your share of the ticket revenue is depressingly low. Shuuji: Well, I definitely have no plans to continue. Meguru: What, seriously? I'd come to watch you play. Shuuji: Again, I'm flattered, but I'd seriously die if I kept up the lifestyle I had the last couple weeks. My left hand is killing me, and I haven't slept well in ages. Shuuji: I also wouldn't be able to attend the club if I were to keep practicing. Meguru: ...You sure take the club pretty seriously. Shuuji: Of course. Shuuji: Helping people one by one like in the OC suits me better. Meguru: Ah, yeah, I know what you mean. Meguru: It's more fun when you're face to face with someone and can see their reactions. The same goes for when you're playing MonHun together! Shuuji: Why do you always compare everything to... Well, I guess you have a point, actually. Meguru: Oh, that's right. Did you hear about the new event? Shuuji: Huh? No, I haven't. Shuuji: Yeah, sure thing. Meguru: Just leave it all to me. It's a monster that'd be tough for a spear user like you, so I'll help you out whenever you want! Shuuji: Really? I'd appreciate it! Shuuji: Though, aren't you going a little out of the way for me? Meguru: Huh?! Oh, well, you see... Um... I was completely useless, right? Meguru: I just sat around being tutored during midterms, and I didn't do anything special for the party like you... Shuuji: I don't think that's true. Meguru: At the end of the day, I'm only good at games... That doesn't make me very helpful, though. Shuuji: Don't be so hard on yourself. I heard you did an awesome job baking the pudding and cookies. Meguru: Anyone could do that. Shuuji: Come to think of it, I haven't tried those yet. Meguru: Yeah, there's some over here. Only the cookies, though... Wanna try one? Shuuji: You bet. Now that my mind is off the performance, I'm pretty hungry. Meguru: Okay... Here you go. They're nothing special, though. Just some perfectly ordinary pumpkin cookies. Shuuji: Let's see. Meguru: Yeah, I made them myself. Shuuji: Wow, color me impressed. That tasted amazing. Meguru: ...You're just flattering me, aren't you? Shuuji: I'm not. I really liked it. Can I have another? Meguru: Of course you can... Shuuji: Thanks... *munch* *munch* Shuuji: Mmm, yeah, these really are good. I love 'em. Meguru: ...... Shuuji: Hey... What's with that look? Meguru: Well, it's suspicious how enthusiastic you are about them. Shuuji: You're being too cynical. You should trust me more. Shuuji: I'm obviously not lying. Just look at how many of the guests are eating these cookies. Meguru: Yeah, I guess. Shuuji: See? You really are helpful. Shuuji: At the very least, I'm really happy I could grab a snack. I'm exhausted after that performance, so the sugar will help a lot. Meguru: Y-You mean it? Th-Thank you. Meguru: I-It's kinda embarrassing to be praised so lavishly... Oh, want some pudding too? I'll get you some. Hold put! Shuuji: Ah, wait― Meguru: Here you go, Senpai. Hope I didn't keep you waiting. Shuuji: I love it. I wouldn't mind you making it for me again sometime. Meguru: Hehe... Shuuji: You seem pleased. Meguru: Huh? Oh, ahaha... I mean, who doesn't like being praised? Shuuji: I'm being serious, by the way. Just trust me and be happy. Meguru: ...Okay. I'll believe you. Meguru: And i-if I feel like it... maybe I'll make more cookies for you sometime. Shuuji: Ooh, I'll be looking forward to it. Shuuji: Alright, then. We threw this party; now it's time to enjoy it.

Nene: If you smile at me like that, I'll... I'll end up...!! Nene: I-I'll be right back. I have to go to the restroom! Shuuji: Ah, okay. I'll be here.  Shuuji: ...... Student: Umm... Excuse me. I heard that I could come here and get help with my problems, and I was wondering if that's true.  Meguru: Yep! We'll help you! Student: Oh, perfect! There was actually something I wanted to ask you all for help with. Touko: Come on inside and make yourself at home. Is that alright, Ayachi-san? Nene: Yes, of course. Please come in. We'll be glad to help you in whatever way we can.  Student: Oh, thank you so much! Excuse me.  Student: O-Oh, no! I'd actually prefer you to be here! You might be able to give me some good advice on this. Shuuji: Oh, really?  Student: Well, the thing is... like... Student: As you can see, I have quite the feminine body. And I also believe I'm pretty cute besides that.  Nene, Tsumugi, Touko, Shuuji: ...... Meguru: ...Say what? Nene: Umm, pardon me for interrupting, but do you mind if I ask you a question? Student: Sure. What is it?  Nene: I'm having a bit of trouble seeing where the problem lies, so let me ask you again... You really are seeking advice, yes? Student: What are you saying?! I have a legit problem on my hands here!! Nene: I-I'm sorry... Touko: Well, let's just calm down, guys. Wait until she's done, okay? Nene: You're right. I shouldn't have interrupted you there. Please continue. Student: No worries! So back to what I was saying.  Student: So... Huh? What was I talking about again? Tsumugi: Something about how you've never had problems getting boyfriends... Student: Ah, right! I'm cute, sexy, and I have a great body, so I can get a boyfriend pretty much at the drop of a hat.  Shuuji: Wow, she really emphasized that part... Shuuji: Umm... *cough* *cough* So continuing on? Student: Right. So I'm currently dating a guy right now, yeah? He's just so cute and adorable, and I want to smother him in affection. He almost seems like a little boy.  Shuuji: Okay... And? Student: But I'm not sure how he feels... I don't know if he loves me the same way... Shuuji: So, basically, let me get this right... You want to figure out how much he loves you? Student: Yeah, that's exactly it.  Touko: Umm, can I shoot you a quick question?  Student: Yeah, that's fine.  Touko: If you're saying this, does that mean you have reason to doubt the sincerity of his feelings?  Student: ...Unfortunately. It's been worrying me and stressing me out so much that I can't even get a good night's sleep anymore. My skin's going to be ruined if this keeps up. Nene: Would you feel comfortable sharing with us what that thing was? Student: Ah, sure. So, the thing is, he, umm... Student: Everytime we go on a date, he wants to do it afterward. Meguru, Tsumugi, Touko: ...What? Nene: ...Umm, sorry, but it's not anything like him acting distant, or cheating on you, or anything similar? Student: No, not at all! Maa-kun is so nice to me! Student: He treats me well, so I don't have any problems with that. But, well... Whenever it's date day, he always gets horny at the end and wants to have sex. Student: Do you think he really loves me?! I'm worried he might just be dating me for my sexy, bodacious body! Meguru: ...Why does she feel the need to add like two to three adjectives everytime she mentions her body.  Shuuji: Hey, they're all accurate.  Meguru: Kgh...!! Tsumugi: So, uh... Could you possibly tell us why you decided to come to us of all people for this problem of yours?  Student: Huh? Well, I heard I could get advice from Ayachi-san and Togakushi-senpai here.  Student: And both of them seem super experienced with stuff like this. I figured they'd have an answer for me in no time. Touko: I appreciate the compliment, but I don't know what to tell you. I don't have a lick of experience in that department. Student: Wow, really? I guess that just means you're so charming that you've never had any reason to doubt the guys you've been with! Amazing!! Touko: No, that's not what I meant! I've never actually had a boyfriend.  Student: What?! That's so unexpected!! Touko: Well, I didn't have time for boys. I was always too busy with my Student Council work. Well, what about you, Ayachi-san? Nene: I-I wouldn't be able to help with that either! Like, at all. Nene: Besides... I'm not one to look up to when it comes to romance. I'm even having related problems myself right now... Ah, err, forget I said that. Tsumugi: Yeah, I don't think I'd be much help either.  Shuuji: Huh? Me? Meguru: Yeah, you. None of us girls have any relationship experience, so our only option is to hear from the other side.  Shuuji: ...I guess that's the logical conclusion. Shuuji: Would he be after you so badly if he didn't love you? Student: Well, I've had previous boyfriends who wanted to do it all the time too, and it turned out they were only in it for the sex!! Shuuji: Man, what the hell do I know!! Shuuji: You mentioned you were going on dates. Are those proper dates? Shuuji: You do actual things, right? Not just, like... go straight to a love hotel, or wherever the spot is... and start going at it.  Student: Oh, of course we do! Maa-kun is so sweet, so we always go where I want to. Shuuji: He seems to be a fairly considerate guy, so I'd say he does love you.  Shuuji: It's hard for me to really determine anything more, since that depends on what kind of guy he is.  Student: Would you like to meet him, then? I really want to hear your opinion after you get to know him!!  Shuuji: %130;Are you serious?! Student: If you don't want to... I could have someone else from here do it.  Touko: I'm not sure that'd be a good idea. It might be best for a guy to evaluate him. Touko: If he was surrounded by girls, he might be too nervous to say anything. He'd probably feel more comfortable sharing his feelings with another guy.  Meguru: You have a point. Would be a problem if he entered defense mode. Tsumugi: I don't anyone's asked this, but does your boyfriend go here too? Student: Yeah, he does! He's a first-year like me, but we're in different classes. His name is Mikawa Masahiro. Meguru: Mikawa-kun? Wow... Talk about unexpected... Nene: Do you know him, Inaba-san? Meguru: Yup. He's in my class. He's cute and has a baby face, like she described, but wow... He's the last person I'd expect to be out having sex... Guess you really can't judge people by appearances. Student: Oh, let me tell you! He's cute as a button, but boy does he fuck like a tiger. Three rounds is his bare minimum, plus his dick is super thick. I almost pass out just from― Meguru: T-T-T-T-T-T-Too much information!! Student: Oh, sorry. I thought you were curious.  "

            "Shuuji: Sorry for coming here so early. Nanao: That's not a problem. I have to get ready to open the store anyway. Nanao: More importantly, you must have something you need to talk about... Maybe about the girl you brought here yesterday. Shuuji: Yes... Did you notice anything? Nanao: Well... Nanao: I presume this is rather serious if you're visiting so early? Shuuji: Yeah... Apparently, Touko-san has been having these dreams. Dreams about a certain woman. Shuuji: It's strange enough that I would never normally believe it. But the past month or two has already been rather strange for me, anyway. Shuuji: So I started thinking, maybe Touko-san has some kind of connection to magic too? Perhaps... she's actually a witch? Nanao: No, she isn't. The presence of magic I feel from her is too weak for her to be a witch. Nanao: To be honest, it's even weaker than the presence I feel from you. There isn't enough magic present in her to grant her any kind of special power. Shuuji: Ah! Then maybe she's like me, and her mom was a witch, and she inherited some of the power? Nanao: Inherited it... No, the presence I feel is very different from yours. Nanao: Do you know anything about her parents? Shuuji: No. Touko-san was an orphan. She told me she was raised in an orphanage. Nanao: She doesn't have parents? Shuuji: It seems not. She said she tried researching them once but wasn't able to find anything about them. Nanao: Something unknown to me... No, wait. Could it be... Shuuji: Huh? Closer to you? Wait, then... Nanao: The presence I feel from her is that of an alp's. Shuuji: Touko-san's an... alp? Nanao: That girl sees dreams about your mother. Nanao: So then, isn't it possible for her to be the alp that signed your mother's contract? Shuuji: Touko-san, and my mom...? Nanao: Though, I'm the one who needs to calm down. I only just arrived at that conclusion myself. I need some time to collect my thoughts. Shuuji: R-Right... Shuuji: Yeah... Yeah, you're right. Nanao: I'll make you a drink. Is the usual house blend okay? Shuuji: Yes, please. Thanks. Nanao: It'll be ready in a moment. Nanao: Here's your coffee. Shuuji: Thank you. Shuuji: It's fine. Does this mean you're ready to continue? Nanao: Yes. Nanao: I've thought it through again, but my conclusion is no different. She's an alp. That's the only thing that makes sense. Shuuji: So, you mean Touko-san is an animal who is assuming the form of a human? Nanao: Yes, but... the presence I feel from her is too weak. And it's strange I wasn't able to recognize one of my own kind at first. Nanao: She's hiding something. Nanao: This is just a baseless theory of mine, but... it's possible that she's a \"former\" alp. Shuuji: What do you mean by that? Nanao: I told you before, didn't I? We're not just interested in humans―we want to become them. So much so that we use magic to look like them. That's our goal. Shuuji: Which means that Senpai achieved her goal and became human...? Nanao: Yes. She isn't an orphan because her parents abandoned her. She's an orphan because she had no human parents to begin with. Shuuji: H-Hold on a second. She told me she has an inheritance! That's what she's been living off of all this time! Nanao: Well... That was probably set up by the person in question. Shuuji: You mean by Touko-san? Nanao: Before she was human, back when she was an alp. Nanao: It's likely that she stored up some magic, then decided to live as a human when she became able to understand them enough. Nanao: When an alp decides to do that, they must throw away all of their powers and memories and start life anew as a human child. Nanao: The dreams she's seeing are memories from when she was an alp. That's why the time scale doesn't add up. Shuuji: Wouldn't that mean she hasn't thrown away her memories? Nanao: The alp must intend to do so, but oftentimes memories cannot be entirely cast aside and will manifest subconsciously in dreams. Nanao: It must be a very important memory to her. Has she said anything about the dreams? Shuuji: That she wanted to be like the woman in her dreams. And that she wanted to be as happy as her. Nanao: Hmm... Perhaps your mother was the one who inspired her to live as a human. Nanao: That yearning for happiness must have been present when she was an alp. A desire strong enough to make her want to become fully human won't just disappear from her memory. Nanao: That's all that I've deduced. Shuuji: ...... Nanao: No, it isn't. Even us alps can't normally resist the effects of magic. Nanao: It was most likely part of your mother's contract. She was granted magic that let her read the minds of everyone but her alp. That condition must have been passed down as well. Nanao: Makes sense, don't you think? Of course, it doesn't line up perfectly, but that's all I can think of right now. Shuuji: If that's the reason, then she must have had a good reason to not want her mind read, right? Shuuji: Why would that be? Nanao: Sorry, but there's no way for me to answer that. Shuuji: Yeah... You're right, sorry. That came off a little harsh. Nanao: It's okay. I'm the one who should've noticed in the first place. Nanao: In any case, she's no longer an alp. She's been fully reborn as a human. Nanao: It might be strange that she can see some of her memories in her dreams, but she's just a normal human without any special powers now. Shuuji: That's not exactly normal, I'd say. Shuuji: It'd be a lot worse if she was actually like a ghost haunting me or something. Shuuji: Yeah. I feel way better now. Thanks a lot. Nanao: You don't have to thank me. This is all just a theory. I have no proof. You can't even ask the girl in question since she wouldn't be able to answer. Nanao: I'm the one who's sorry. I wasn't able to give you anything concrete. Shuuji: No, you've helped me sort out my own feelings. Shuuji: I really do love that girl. Nanao: ...I see. Nanao: That's something you should be telling her, I think. Shuuji: Yeah, absolutely. Nanao: Sorry, this conversation took longer than I expected. Your coffee must be cold by now. Want me to make you another? Shuuji: Huh? Oh, no, thanks for the offer though. I'm gonna be late if I don't― Shuuji: Oh, shit! I only have two minutes! I'm definitely gonna be late! Sorry, gotta dash! Nanao: Hah, sure thing. Shuuji: I'm really sorry for just barging in on you this morning! Nanao: It's fine. You're welcome back any time. Don't be a stranger. Shuuji: Thanks! Touko: You're welcome, and thank you too. It was great. Shuuji: Yours was even better. Especially the eggs. Touko: I tried making them a little on the sweet side today. I'm glad you liked them. I'll keep making them sweet from now on. Shuuji: That'd be great! Thanks. Touko: I'll have to write this down too. Touko: Oh, you know about this? Shuuji: Yeah, duh. I was there with you yesterday. Touko: Yeah. I'd forget what I want to write about if I left it at home. So why not keep it with me until writing in it becomes a habit? Shuuji: Yeah, it's hard to keep up with things you're not used to. Touko: Oh, speaking of things we're not used to... Shuu-kun, you're really not used to making lunch, are you? Shuuji: Huh? No, I'm not. It was a pain making them just for myself. Shuuji: Wait, does it taste bad?! Touko: Not at all. I loved it. Thank you. Shuuji: No, thank you for your amazing lunches. Touko: Don't mention it! Touko: The taste wasn't the issue... I brought it up because you were late today, right? Shuuji: Oh, well... A bit. Touko: So I thought maybe you were late because you're not used to making lunches and it took you too long... Shuuji: Not at all. Lunch wasn't why I was late. Touko: Then... why were you? Were you feeling a little sick? Shuuji: No, I felt fine... I just overslept. Touko: Oho～ You were doing something dirty late at night, weren't you? Oh my! You naughty boy. Shuuji: H-Haha... Touko: Oh? You're not denying it? H-Huh? Does that mean I hit the bullseye? Touko: Sorry, I only meant that as a joke. Shuuji: No, it's okay. It's just a bit of an awkward subject. Shuuji: Huh? Touko: Were you holding back? Shuuji: Holding back what? Touko: That must've been one intense solo session if you were at it all night. You were backed up, weren't you? Touko: Were you worrying about me and holding back? You can always talk to me, if so. Shuuji: Huh?! Oh, no... That's not... Touko: Really? I would never be grossed out by something like that. In fact... Touko: It's actually... rather interesting. Shuuji: It's... interesting? Touko: It is! I mean... We're still studying, aren't we? And also... back then... Touko: It was my first time, so, honestly... it did hurt. But that started to change near the end. Touko: All my strength left me, I felt all light, and my mind went blank... I can't really explain it. I've never felt anything like that before. Shuuji: Same here. That was the first time I've ever felt that good. Touko: And you came so much that it made me giddy, remember? Touko: If we'd kept going like that... I don't know what would have happened to me. I can't even imagine it. That's why I'm interested. Shuuji: Y-You don't say... Touko: Is that a slutty thing for me to say? Is that... a turn-off? Shuuji: No, not at all. Actually, umm, I'm happy you want to do it again. Relieved, even. Shuuji: I went a bit wild, so I've been pretty worried. Touko: I didn't dislike it, you know? It felt... really good. Touko: I've always heard that the first time hurts a lot, and it did when you first put it in. But before I realized it... it had started to feel good. Touko: Maybe that just shows how compatible we are? Shuuji: Yeah, maybe. I don't think it would've been like that with just anyone. Touko: Yeah, we're special. It felt so good that if it kept on that way, I think I would have orgasmed. Touko: That's part of our love studies too, I think. So... Touko: Will you bring me to climax, Shuu-kun? Shuuji: ...... Touko: Okay, great. Shuuji: ...... Touko: Mm... Touko: Mm, mmm... Mmmph! Shuuji: Mm... Mmpah, mmph... Touko: Mmpwah! Mm, mmph... *kiss* *kiss* Touko: One more... Mm, mmmph, mmpah... Shuuji: H-Hold on a second! We can't go any further. Touko: What? Why not? Shuuji: Did you already forget what we agreed to? We have to be careful not to get carried away at school. Touko: We agreed to that...? I remember no such promise. Shuuji: Don't try and wriggle your way out of this. You did agree to that with me, yes. Touko: Okay... So, are we not allowed dessert either? I thought that much might be okay. Shuuji: Not an intense one like that. Shuuji: ...I'd gladly kiss you all day outside of school, though. Touko: Really? Shuuji: You bet. Touko: Hehe, okay. I'll hold you to that. Touko: Besides, everyone in the club has to use this space. We shouldn't go too far in it. Shuuji: Exactly. Touko: Well... I can't today. I promised to meet someone. I'm sorry. Shuuji: You did? Shuuji: Umm... This person wouldn't happen to be a boy, would it? Touko: ...You curious? Mufu. Shuuji: Well yeah, but... I don't think it matters. I can tell I have nothing to worry about from the way you're talking. Touko: Mm... I'm happy you trust me, but it would've been cuter if you got all flustered. Touko: I am planning on meeting a guy, by the way. An older one. Shuuji: But it's no one I need to be worrying about, is it? Touko: Not really. I have to meet my lawyer today. Shuuji: Your lawyer... The one in charge of your inheritance? Touko: Yeah. He's been really helpful ever since I've started living on my own. Touko: We meet once a month to discuss my financial situation. I even have to keep an accounts book. Touko: So you have nothing to worry about, like you said. By \"older,\" I meant he was over 60 already. Shuuji: I see. Touko: I have to take the day off from our club too, and I'm not sure when I'll be done... I'm sorry that I have to turn you down. Shuuji: Oh, no. You gotta do what you gotta do. Shuuji: That'd be sweet. Oh, I mean... I'd love to. Please, let's. Touko: Okay. Well then... make sure you follow through on that request when the time comes. Shuuji: I-I'll do my best. Shuuji: Hmm... This weekend... Touko: Do you have plans already? Shuuji: No. I'm just wondering what my dad's plans are. Shuuji: He might be a workaholic, but even he takes some weekends off. Shuuji: Huh? Your place? A-Are you sure? Touko: Yeah, of course. I'm always the one coming to yours. Shuuji: Great! I'd love to! Touko: Great. I guess we should sort out our meeting time and place then. Shuuji: Okay! Touko: Let me just lock up... There we go. Touko: What? Shuuji: Your lawyer seems to know a lot about your family. Touko: Unfortunately not. Only enough to know that they wouldn't have left me behind if they could help it. Touko: As soon as he saw me, he could tell I was my mother's daughter. Shuuji: ...Do you look a lot like her or something? Touko: Yeah, like two peas in a pod, he says. In fact, he says we look so similar that he almost thought I was her for a moment. That's why he's so convinced I'm her daughter. Shuuji: You really look that alike? That's pretty unusual. Touko: I know. Children often bear some resemblance to their parents, but it's not often they look exactly the same. Touko: Oh, there's the bell. It's time for us to go back to class, unfortunately. Shuuji: Yeah. Shuuji: Exactly the same as her mother, huh... Nene: It's evening now. Let's stop things here for the day. Meguru: Sounds good. Tsumugi: I'll put away the cups. Meguru: Hey, you two... Wait, Togakushi-senpai took the day off today, didn't she? Shuuji: There's no point in me leaving on my own, so I'll help out. Tsumugi: Thank you. Meguru: Is something wrong with Togakushi-senpai? Nene: She told me that she had plans to meet someone. Meguru: She's meeting someone... Aren't you worried, Senpai? Shuuji: I've heard all about it. She's not doing anything worth worrying about. Meguru: Oh, sounds like you trust her a lot. Tsumugi: That's great. Nene: Well then, let's all clean up together. Shuuji: Let's see... I got the detergent and some salt... Don't think we needed anything else. "

Nene: Shiiba-san and I are able to get along great, so you alps shouldn't fight either. Nanao: We made sure to set some ground rules so we wouldn't. Nanao: Oh well, it's fine. This is just a one-time thing. I'll trust you on this. Shuuji: Thank you, Souma-san. Nanao: Why are you the one thanking me? Shuuji: Oh, uh... Well... Tsumugi: Sorry to keep you all waiting! Tsumugi: Umm, this girl here is Akagi. Akagi: I am indeed Akagi. Although there is only one of you I have not yet met. Nene: It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Nanao's witch, Ayachi Nene. Akagi: The pleasure is all mine. Nene: ...Fascinating. She really does talk in a bit of an old-fashioned way. Nanao: Yeah, I know. I'm joining in too. Akagi: Well, you already know half of it anyway. There is hardly any reason for us to fight now. Nanao: I agree. That doesn't change how unnatural this meeting is, though. Akagi: That is only because you are such a stickler for the rules. But I shan't let that bother me this time. Akagi: Also, bring me a glass of milk. Tsumugi: Ah, umm. I'll go with a lemon tea. Nanao: Understood. Your orders will be coming right up. Akagi: So then... Akagi: You can talk more at ease. I don't like stiff talk. Shuuji: Okay, Akagi. Akagi: Good. Akagi: You... have magic in you, don't you? How very peculiar. No wonder you're allowed to accompany the two witches here. Shuuji: I don't really know much about that myself... Shuuji: But you're a little wrong about something. It's me who wants to know about Kizuki-san. Akagi: Do you know Chihoko? Shuuji: ...More like, I know someone who does. Akagi: Well, it's fine either way. What do you wish to know? Akagi: No idea. Shuuji: Wait, what?! Akagi: I simply thought that it would be better for me not to know. Shuuji: ...... Akagi: After all, the girl no longer knows anything about me either. Akagi: But that was part of the price she paid in order to see her wish fulfilled. That's how it is in our world. Nene: You mean... Tsumugi: A witch... Akagi: Indeed. You have it right. Akagi: She even lost her friend in order to have her wish fulfilled. Akagi: If I remember correctly... Her name was Inaba Meguru. Akagi: I don't understand much about friendship, but it's something humans value, is it not? And Chihoko has lost her only one. I have no idea where and how Chihoko or that Meguru girl are living their lives now... Meguru: ...... Touko: Hmm, it's so quiet when it's just two of us. Touko: I'm trying to liven things up, but I'm the only one talking. Meguru: ...I'm sorry. Touko: Ooh, you actually said something! Though, I'm still not sure how I'm supposed to make this more fun for us. Touko: But I'll try my best. You can talk to me about anything, and I won't say a word to anyone. Give it a shot!

Touko: Phew... I thought you hated me for a moment, there. Meguru: O-Of course I don't hate you! But... Touko: Yeah? You can go into more detail with me, if you'd like. Touko: You may feel better after talking to someone. Meguru: O-Okay... Umm... So... Touko: ...... Touko: You don't hate me, but...? Meguru: Ah! Right... Meguru: ...It's just so frustrating. Meguru: Why Nene-senpai and Tsumugi-senpai? Why didn't he ask me? Touko: Hmm... Meguru: And it seemed like the same thing happened yesterday. I just... Touko: Hmm... Can I ask you one question? Meguru: Ah, y-yeah. What is it? Touko: You're talking about Hoshina-kun, right? Meguru: ...? Well, yeah. Touko: Right, thought so. But... Touko: I don't think it was necessarily Hoshina-kun who invited Ayachi-san and Shiiba-san to go shopping today, you know. Meguru: ...... Meguru: Th-That may be so, but it's basically the same thing either way. Meguru: I'm still being left behind... Touko: Hmm... Well, I can't deny that. Touko: But, really... I see... Mufufu♪ Meguru: Wh-What's so funny? Touko: Nothing. I'm thinking about some tea. Do you want some? Meguru: ...Yeah. Touko: Gotcha. Just give me a few moments. Meguru: Ahhh... This is so frustrating. It's killing me! Touko: Oh gosh, how adorable. Touko: You know, Inaba-san, the way I see it... Meguru: Yeah...? Touko: You're the only one Hoshina-kun has eyes for. Meguru: ...... Meguru: Wh-What are you saying? There's no way that's true. Touko: Really? Meguru: Well, I mean... Meguru: It's not like Senpai is here with― Shuuji: %130;Meguru!! Meguru: Ah! Shuuji: What...? Touko: Oh, never mind me. Touko: You're in an awful hurry for someone who's just coming back from a shopping trip. Also, where are Ayachi-san and Shiiba-san? Shuuji: Oh, they're at... You know that place I brought you to before? Shuuji: They're there, at the Schwarze Katze. Touko: Oh yeah, that cafe. Their parfaits are wonderful. Shuuji: Anyway, Meguru! Meguru: Huh?! Y-Yeah! Shuuji: Sorry, I was in such a rush... I should have called you on the way here or asked Ayachi-san and Shiiba-san to do so... Shuuji: Anyway! That doesn't matter since you're still here. Meguru: U-Umm... Senpai? Shuuji: Would you come with me? Meguru: Huh? Touko: What about me, Hoshina-kun? Shuuji: Yeah, you too, please. You've done a lot to help us, so... I don't want to keep secrets anymore. Touko: Alrighty. I shall accompany you. Meguru: Umm, hey, so, Senpai! What is this― Shuuji: Sorry, Meguru. I need apologize in advance. Meguru: Huh?! Wh-What the heck is happening?! Shuuji: I'll explain later. Just come with me! Shuuji: We've found out what happened to Kizuki-san! Meguru: Huh? Chi-chan...? Nene: ―And that about covers it. Magic is real, and we are witches. Nene: You need to know these things, or else you'll find it hard to comprehend what we're about to talk about. Nene: I know this must be sudden, but please accept it for now. Meguru: O-Okay...? Meguru: Oh, well, umm... This doesn't seem like the kind of thing you can go around telling people willy-nilly, so umm, like... I don't really mind. Meguru: Actually, I feel kinda bad because I'm not sure I'm really following all this... Nene: I can explain any of the finer details you don't understand later. Nene: Togakushi-senpai, the same goes for you. Touko: Gotcha. I'm already grateful enough to be included in this.  Meguru: ...S-So, umm! Meguru: Senpai, you said you found out about Chi-chan... Shuuji: Yeah... We actually found someone who knows Kizuki-san. Shuuji: Akagi, can you take it from here? Akagi: Of course. Akagi: Rest assured, I'm not as young as I look. I am much older than you and Chihoko. Akagi: ...So you're Meguru, huh? My name is Akagi. I have heard a lot about you from Chihoko. Akagi: Mainly that you were her one and only friend. Her best friend. Meguru: ......!! Meguru: P-Please! Please tell me about Chi-chan! Akagi: In due time. Let us sit down, first. Meguru: Okay! Akagi: Also... Hey, I want my milk! Meguru: A-A glass of milk, please! Akagi: Haha... I had already ordered the milk, lass. Meguru: ...Huh? What the heck is \"milk glass\"? Shuuji: No, she said \"lass.\" She doesn't talk like a normal girl. Just think of her as your typical unaging loli. Meguru: ...Oh yeah! I see those in games and stuff all the time. Makes sense. Meguru: Ahaha... Milk is fine for me too. Akagi: Excellent choice. Matching drinks for the who share a bond with Chihoko. Akagi: Indeed, I can. I shall explain everything from the beginning. Meguru: What...? Akagi: That is, she was a witch. She had a wish that she wanted more than anything. Akagi: And so we formed a contract to fulfill that wish, thus making Chihoko my witch. Akagi: ...Meguru, do you understand everything so far? Meguru: Yeah... Meguru: I had no idea Chi-chan was a witch... Akagi: Your surprise is only natural. Witches tend not to talk about magic to those unrelated to our craft. Akagi: But it is different now; you have already been informed about us. Hence, I'm able to tell you now. It was necessary in order explain her current situation. Tsumugi: Actually I didn't know about that either. Tsumugi: You never told me that you made a contract with Chihoko-chan while you already had a contract with me... Shuuji: Oh, yeah... I guess that would've had to have been the case. Akagi: It's not as if I did anything wrong. There is no rule that says alps can only have one contractor. Nanao: Don't act like that's normal. We usually don't have more than one witch at a time. Shuuji: A-Anyway... Akagi, Shiiba-san was already your witch at the time? Akagi: Correct. Shuuji: Then why did you form a contract with Kizuki-san? Shuuji: Meguru, Kizuki-san used to live around here, right? Meguru: Y-Yeah. Chi-chan's place was about a 10-minute walk from my house. Akagi: I had no special reason. The girl vacationed in the town where I and Tsumugi were. She and I got to know each other, and then we exchanged a contract. That is all. Akagi: And so, for a time, I occasionally visited this town to check in on her. Akagi: But, well... because of that, there may have been a minor territorial dispute with that cat over there. Nanao: I don't want to hear it, bird. This is why I can't deal with winged creatures. Nanao: You put me through a lot, back then. Akagi: But I'll actually go crazy if I don't travel every once in a while. Maybe because I used to be a migratory bird. A cat wouldn't understand. Nanao: Oh well, it's all in the past. I don't want to start a fight in front of Nene. Akagi: Good. But we digress. Akagi: Getting back on topic... I assume you wish to know what happened to Chihoko after that? Meguru: Y-Yeah! I do! Akagi: Then I shall tell you. Where should I start... Akagi: Chihoko started gathering fragments shortly after becoming my witch. Akagi: But this was more difficult for her than most other witches. Akagi: After all, the emotional price she had to pay was an unusually harsh one... Akagi: And to make matters worse, I was only occasionally around. I couldn't offer my support around the clock.  Akagi: However, despite the obstacles set before her, she cleared them all and completed her magic. Akagi: She was just that desperate to complete her wish. Akagi: It shows how important that wish was to her. Meguru: What was it... that Chi-chan had wished for? Akagi: ...... Akagi: \"I want you to cure Megu-chan's disease.\" Meguru: ...... Meguru: I've never had any disease that― Akagi: I thought so. I had a feeling this would be the case. Akagi: Chihoko's departure must have been a tremendous shock that left you scarred. Akagi: But your body, on the other hand, seems as healthy as can be. Meguru: Wait! Wait a moment... I can't deny the part about the hole in my heart, but... Meguru: It wasn't me who was sickly, but Chi-chan... Akagi: ...While Chihoko was a quiet and slender girl, she didn't have any serious illnesses. Akagi: The tremendous shock must have jumbled up your memories.  Meguru: ...... Akagi: Or perhaps having your body cured overnight caused your brain to process it that way in order to keep things logically consistent. Akagi: Either way, it was you who had been suffering from an incurable illness. I had heard so from none other than Chihoko herself. Akagi: She told me that, due to your weak body, you stayed at home most days reading books.  Meguru: Ah... Akagi: She also told me that you often played video games together. You're quite good at them, are you not? Meguru: ...I-I guess. Akagi: But I also need to talk about the price she paid in order to see that wish fulfilled. Akagi: For that price is what had caused your separation. Meguru: Wh-What kind of price was it? Akagi: Listen well. The number of fragments required fulfill her wish was excessive, perhaps due to the strength of the disease you were afflicted with. Akagi: And on that same token, the emotional price she had to pay was unusually heavy. Akagi: For instance... Tsumugi. The price you're paying is also harsh, but the worst that can happen is some nausea, and you're otherwise fine as long as you dress in men's clothes, correct? Tsumugi: Y-Yeah, right. It's pretty harsh for me personally, but there's no danger involved or anything... Akagi: ...But it wasn't the same for Chihoko. Akagi: There was no way to fully avoid her price, and no loopholes to avoid triggering it. Akagi: It was the kind of price that came with permanent consequences. Consequences that would last even after her wish was fulfilled. Akagi: And that was the issue... Meguru: I can't take this anymore. Just tell me already! What happened to Chi-chan?! Akagi: The price she paid was... Akagi: Forgetting anyone she was close to. Meguru: Ah... Akagi: Don't complain to me. No one can predict the kind of price you'll get in advance. Akagi: That was simply the price she got. That's all there is to say. Meguru: Then, Chi-chan... Akagi: ...Needless to say, she was stunned when she first learned of her price. And at first, she blamed me heavily for it. Akagi: However, she quickly resolved herself. Akagi: In order to avoid causing needless distress, she proceeded to gradually distance herself and cut ties from everyone she knew. Akagi: Yet she couldn't bring herself to do the same for you. Akagi: Even though she would eventually forget you as well... she endured that fear and remained by your side. Meguru: B-But why... Why would she go so far? Akagi: Well, because you were her best friend. Meguru: ...... Akagi: She told me this... Akagi: \"Megu-chan is actually a very cheerful girl. She's a wonderful person that anyone could come to love.\" Akagi: \"I'm really bad at making friends and only have Megu-chan, but deep down, she's different.\" Akagi: \"And to think she told me I'm her one and only friend. Her best friend in the whole world.\" Akagi: \"She said that as long as she has me, she doesn't need other friends.\" Akagi: \"Hearing that made me so very happy...\" Akagi: \"And so... I want to thank her.\" Akagi: \"I want to repay Megu-chan somehow.\" Akagi: \"I want to make the friend I'm so proud of be able to cheerfully run around outside.\" Akagi: \"I want her to be loved by everyone in her class.\" Akagi: \"Even if I end up forgetting about her...\" Akagi: \"...I want to help her become able to face life without me.\" Akagi: \"And to achieve that, I want to complete our contract and cure her disease.\" Meguru: ...... Akagi: The first to be forgotten was her parents. Akagi: They were beyond startled. They talked about medical examinations and surgery. They eventually decided to move somewhere far away for their daughter to live. Akagi: And then... At the very end, she even forgot her precious friend. The one her magic was meant for in the first place. Akagi: As a result... you ended up suddenly losing your best friend. Akagi: The lack of farewells was only natural. Chihoko had lost her memory of you by that point. Akagi: That was when her parents cut all ties to their life here and moved away with their daughter... Tsumugi: So that's what happened... Nene: That's why the school didn't have any records... Touko: ...You really don't where she went? Not even you? Akagi: No. I have no idea where she is living currently. Akagi: It is probably for the best to not look for her. I have no intention of doing that either. Akagi: It would likely only bother her and her parents and possibly even cause her undue stress. Meguru: So then... She's just... Shuuji: Kh... Akagi: Meguru, do you understand what that means? Meguru: Well... Meguru: Chi-chan cured my disease, but in exchange, she doesn't remember me anymore... Akagi: That's right! But to do that... Akagi: ...She saw it through to the end, even after she had already forgotten about you. Meguru: Ahh...! Akagi: Even I was surprised by that. Akagi: She really didn't remember you anymore. Akagi: But she told me that she could tell how important this was to do. Akagi: That by doing this, she was sure her wish would come true. Akagi: Despite the fact that she didn't even remember who that wish would cure anymore. Akagi: At the very end, she even forgot me. And yet, she still saw it through. Akagi: ...Chihoko was an amazing human. She said that she wanted this to serve as her farewell. Akagi: She may have forgotten you... But the magic she brought to life in exchange was literally Chihoko herself. Akagi: And that magic is now living on in your heart, Meguru. Meguru: Ah, aah... Meguru: Yeah...! Meguru: Senpai...! Akagi: That's right. Meguru: Thanks to Chi-chan... I... Meguru: I never left her thoughts... Meguru: My good health was Chi-chan's last gift to me. Meguru: It's Chi-chan's memories that are giving me life! Meguru: I...! I had never lost my best friend! Meguru: I haven't been able to do anything for Chi-chan! Meguru: It's so painful... I don't know how I can possibly repay Chi-chan for all she's done. Akagi: ...Let me tell you something here and now, Meguru. Akagi: I'm sure you were but an empty shell after losing Chihoko. Meguru: Y-Yeah... Akagi: But the girl I see today isn't just healthy. Akagi: She's surrounded by many friends. You're loved dearly. Everyone you see here now is giving you their full support, are they not? Meguru: Akagi... Akagi: Furthermore, I was honestly taken aback when I saw you today. Akagi: You are nothing like the child Chihoko described to me. You have a serious sense of fashion and, how should I put this... You're a real looker. Meguru: I'm dressing like this because... Akagi: You needn't say it. Both I and Chihoko know. Akagi: You recovered and got back on your feet because you knew that you couldn't let things continue as they had been, am I right? Meguru: Ah... Akagi: I am positive that was what Chihoko was truly wishing for. So rest assured! Akagi: For you have fulfilled Chihoko's wish as well. Meguru: ～～～～! Meguru: Waaaaaaah! Meguru: I'll do my best! I'll live strong for you! Meguru: You don't have to worry anymore... I'm strong now. Meguru: Wahh... Waaaaaah! "

Are you sure about this?) Nene: (Yes. It's okay. This is what I want. Shiiba-san needs fragments just as much as I do, after all.) Nene: (Besides, most of my fragments are inside of you, and we've seen now that they can be returned. There's no need to rush.) Tsumugi: Oh, me too! I feel the same as you!

I could never tell anyone why, and so everyone around me ended up kinda grossed out... Tsumugi: I was really worried if I'd be able to fit in here, but then I ended up making friends right away. That made me so happy. Tsumugi: But... after finding out you're in the same position as I am, I thought for sure that we'd have to stop being friends.

You should take it easy and go home early if you're still feeling sick. Meguru: I'm sorry. I got a little carried away there. Tsumugi: No, it's not your fault. That was just, umm... a physical condition of mine acting up. Shuuji: A physical condition? Meguru: You mean, like, how some people get a stomach ache when they're nervous? Tsumugi: I guess it's sorta like that. But it's not about nervousness at all. In my case, it's, umm... Tsumugi: I can't hold it in whenever I dress like a girl. Meguru: When you dress like a girl...? Shuuji: And by you can't hold it in, you mean that you barf? Tsumugi: ...... Shuuji: Could be... Meguru: Do you have some sort of trauma involving girl's clothing or something? Shuuji: Hey, should you really be asking her that? Meguru: Oh, you're right! I'm sorry for blurting out such a personal question like that... Tsumugi: No, it's okay. I don't have any traumas or anything. I actually really like girl's clothes. Meguru: So it's just a super rare physical condition? Tsumugi: Ah... Yeah, something like that... Shuuji: ...Hm? Nene: Hoshina-kun, is something the matter? Shuuji: Ah, no... It's nothing. Tsumugi: Yeah... I can push things to some degree, but it's hard to know when I'll reach my limit. Meguru: But then you hit that limit and ended up puking anyway... Tsumugi: ...I'm really sorry. I was so happy at the prospect of looking girly that I forgot myself... I thought I could handle some more. Tsumugi: I know... I'm weird, aren't I? Meguru: Well, that just means that instead of changing your hairstyle, we should start with smaller accessories next time! Tsumugi: ...Huh? Meguru: What? You don't want to? Should I stop trying to push this stuff on you? Tsumugi: N-No! That's not it! I'm actually really happy! Tsumugi: But... doesn't my condition put you off? Meguru: Huh? No, of course not! Meguru: It's only got me more pumped, actually! Now I want to do whatever it takes to make you look girly!

Thank you so much, Inaba-san! I'm really looking forward to it! Meguru: Oh, please. This isn't that big a deal! Shuuji: ...... Nene: I don't know... I'd love help if possible, but there's only so much we can do if we're fighting against a physical condition. Shuuji: You're right, but there's something that I― Nene: Ah, please come in! Touko: Pardon me. Touko: Hey there! You all working hard? Shuuji: Togakushi-senpai? Nene: What brings you here? Is there something you need to relay to us? Touko: Nah. I'm here for something else today. I need your help with something, actually. Nene: By that, you mean you're here to consult us on a problem? Touko: Yep. Your club helps out other students, yeah? Nene: Yes... But I find it unusual that you would come for our help. Touko: Yeah, I usually try to handle things myself. I'm in a bit over my head this time, though. Touko: So, could I please have your help? Nene: Of course. We'll gladly help out in any way we can. Touko: Thanks. I really appreciate it! Nene: Hoshina-kun, about what you were trying to say... Shuuji: Oh, don't worry about it. Togakushi-senpai's problem is more important right now. Nene: I see... Then please tell me about it some other day. Touko: By the way, who are those two? I haven't seen them around before. Are they new members? I did receive a report on something like that... Touko: Huh? I'm pretty sure the report mentioned only one new member. Meguru: Ah, yeah! That was probably about me. I'm Inaba Meguru from class 1-D. Touko: Nice to meet you. I'm the Student Council president, Togakushi Touko. Tsumugi: And, um, I may be in a boy's uniform, but I'm a perfectly normal girl! I'm Shiiba Tsumugi. I transferred into class 2-A today! Touko: Ahh, right, right. I heard that I girl with some special circumstances transferred in today. Touko: Right, so that's you, huh? Now I know what they meant by \"special circumstances.\" Tsumugi: There are some private reasons why I have to dress like this... I'm sorry. Touko: Don't worry about it. The school gave permission, so it's all good. I don't see a problem with having a girl like you here. Touko: So anyway, did you join the Occult Club too? Tsumugi: Only on a trial basis. I think I'll join if I can manage to keep up. Touko: Oho... I see your harem is growing, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: That's not what I'm going for, and you know it. Touko: Oh, please～ I know you're thrilled about this. You're living every boy's dream. As a healthy young man, you must have it pretty \"hard,\" huh? Mufufu. Shuuji: Stop with the terrible dirty jokes! Shuuji: We all take this club very seriously! Touko: Okay, okay. That's good to hear. Touko: Shiiba-san, let's get along. Feel free to come to me if there's anything you ever need help with. Tsumugi: Okay. Thank you, Togakushi-senpai. Touko: Then again... I plan on retiring very soon. Tsumugi: Oh. Is that so? Touko: It's already fall, after all. That's when the president retires―or at least, that's how it usually goes. I don't know what's going to happen this time, though... Shuuji: Huh? What do you mean by that? It's not like you won't retire, right? Touko: Of course I'm going to. I'm not about to spend another year here. The problem is the next president... Nene: That's right... The presidential candidates haven't been announced yet. Nene: Considering the time of the year, won't it be a problem if they're not announced soon? Shuuji: Would it? Touko: We would love to, but... I'm in a bit of a bind regarding that. Shuuji: That's what you've come to the OC for? Touko: Yep. That's what I'd like your help with. Shuuji: Umm, incidentally, is it okay for you to be telling us this stuff? Touko: Don't worry. None of it is exactly top-secret information. Nene: So, what is the problem? Touko: The fact is, there are no candidates yet. We don't have any to announce. With the way things are going, I might have to retire without anyone to take over. Shuuji: Wow, that's a pretty serious problem. Meguru: Umm, do you usually have a lot of candidates every year? I'm still a first-year, so I don't know... Meguru: But I feel like seeing more than one would be pretty weird. Touko: That's generally how it is here. We never have enough candidates for a real election, so we just run an approval vote. Shuuji: But it looks like even an approval vote won't be possible this year, huh? Touko: For lesser posts like secretary or vice president, we can decide the president first and then have them appoint everyone else. Nene: But that approach isn't possible if you don't have a presidential candidate to begin with. Touko: That's right. So I just don't know what to do anymore... Nene: But, Togakushi-senpai, I thought you usually have one of the current second-year Student Council members run. Touko: True, that is how it often goes. I used to be the secretary. But it's just a custom; I can't force anyone. Shuuji: Is there anyone who'd be fit for office from your point of view? Touko: There is. My current vice president, Koshiji-san. Touko: She's super cute! And her skin is really smooth. She's a very charming girl. Shuuji: None of that has anything to do with her qualifications. Koshiji-san, though... I think she'd do a good job. Meguru: Do you know her, Senpai? Shuuji: I was in the same class as her last year. I even filled in for her class rep duties a few times because the Student Council kept her so busy. Shuuji: She was actually the vice president? Touko: She was the treasurer and became the vice president following last fall's elections. Meguru: ...Senpai, you should pay more attention to these things. Shuuji: Well, err... Yeah, you're right. Though, I don't think many students here pay much attention to the Student Council. Touko: Tell me about it. The whole reason we have no candidates is because nobody seems to care. Touko: We've even been handing out fliers to let everyone know about our lack of candidates, you know? Shuuji: Oh, that's right. I saw you talking to Koshiji-san? Was that maybe about this? Touko: You saw that? How embarrassing... But you're right. I asked her to run, but she turned me down. Touko: She's got a magnetic personality and has been a member of the Student Council since she was a freshman. She's way more capable than I am. I would've been thrilled if she took over. Tsumugi: Why doesn't she want to run? Touko: She wouldn't say. And not only is she not running, she's quitting the Student Council outright. Shuuji: Is this sudden? Has she shown signs of wanting to quit before? Touko: Nope. She took everyone on the council by surprise. We were all convinced that she'd run for president. Tsumugi: Do you think she got fed up with Student Council work? Touko: Not from what I can tell, I don't think... Touko: Her attendance rate is very high, and she always happily does her job. She often stays late with me, after everyone else has already gone home. Tsumugi: Then what could be the reason? Shuuji: Is this just, like, a sudden change of heart? I dunno why she wouldn't tell you the reason, though. Nene: Can we take it that you want us to convince Koshiji-san to stay, then? Touko: Ah, no, sorry. Like I said earlier, I can't force anyone. Touko: I don't want you to convince her. I want you to help me find another candidate. Nene: Is there no one else in the Student Council who wants to run? Touko: Hmm, not really... Everyone else thinks Koshiji-san is perfect for the job, so they're all hesitating, or more like, afraid to take on that role for themselves. Touko: I may have a member run as a last resort, but I'm hoping someone steps up on their own. It'd be awfully nice if we could find a willing regular student. Touko: There are a lot of students like Hoshina-kun who aren't very clued-in, yeah? I'm hoping that there's someone out there who will step up once they hear what's happening. Nene: Okay, I understand the situation now. Touko: So... Can I take it that you're going to help me? Nene: Yes. I don't know how much we'll be able to help, but we'll do what we can. Touko: Thanks! You're the best! Nene: So, if you don't mind, I'd like to ask a few questions about the Student Council... Touko: And that's about all you need to know. Nene: Thank you for the explanation. I suppose we'll just have to ask around. Meguru: Umm, can first-years run for president? Touko: They can. Second-years running is just a custom, not a rule. There have been some first-year presidents, actually. Touko: Are you interested, Inaba-san? Would you like some... private tutoring? I'll teach you everything you need to know and then some, with just the two of us... Mufufu! Meguru: N-No thanks! I don't swing that way! And I doubt I'd be a very good president, anyway. Meguru: I'll ask my friends to see if anyone's interested. Touko: Yeah? Bummer. As long as you have the motivation for it, you don't need to worry about the actual work; you'll have the help of everyone on the council. Meguru: Got it. I'll let them know that. Touko: On that note, I would even welcome a fresh transfer student, as long as they were motivated. Tsumugi: Umm... I'll give it some thought. Touko: Okay, please do. Touko: Alright, then. I'm sorry for asking you all to pick up my slack, but... Nene: We will do what we can. Shuuji: Honestly? I kinda doubt it. Tsumugi: I'm sorry. I don't think I'll be able to be of any help since I've just transferred. Shuuji: Don't worry about it. I doubt any of us will be able to do much. Nene: That's right. All we can do anyway is ask everyone we know if they're interested in running. Meguru: Who knows, maybe we'll find someone who'll immediately agree to run when asked. Nene: Yeah, maybe. We shouldn't go into this assuming that we'll fail. Meguru: Alright, let's give this our best starting tomorrow! "

Wakana: Oh my god, I LITERALLY just told you that empty apologies are the worst thing you can do! Shuuji: Alright, alright, don't fight, guys. I appreciate that you're fighting over me, but that would cause a few problems for me.  Hideaki: Then just make up with her already and we won't have a reason to fight.  Wakana: Yeah. Get things back to normal between you two. You've only been going out for a week or two, so you're wasting precious time. Hideaki: Every second spent fighting is a second not spent French-kissing. Time is precious. You're not gonna be able to spend this much time together all throughout the day when you go on and graduate.  Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Oh, Shiiba-san? Meguru: Boy, let me tell you, we searched all over for you.  Shuuji: And Inaba-san, too. Touko: Ah, are you chatting with your friends? Sorry to interrupt.  Shuuji: The gang's all here... Tsumugi: We just wanted to talk about a little something, but we can wait if you're busy.  Shuuji: Ah, no... We're probably done here... Kariya? Wakana: Yep, it's all you from here on out, pal. So get your butt into gear and do something about things! Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Right... So what did you all want to talk about? Tsumugi: So does that mean... You were talking about her with those two? Shuuji: Yeah. They thought we were fighting or something. Are we being that conspicuous? Tsumugi: What do you think? It's so obvious. Especially with Ayachi-san. She's been acting really different. Touko: And not even a week ago you two were stuck together like glue.  Tsumugi: You'd always sneak off together during lunch break, but now you're eating separately.  Meguru: So what's going on here? Meguru: Nene-senpai is the kindest soul out there. What the heck did you do to upset her? Tsumugi: O-Oh no, don't tell me you... you forced yourself on her... or something? Meguru: Ugh! Is super-perv Senpai back at it again?! Shuuji: HECK NO! Man, do you guys seriously think I'd have the guts to do something like that?! I'm a tried-and-true wuss, okay! Tsumugi: I'm not really sure that's something to be proud of.  Touko: Putting that aside for now: I know I don't know what happened... But it's not a fight, right? Shuuji: Yeah, it's not. Meguru: A battle of wills, then? Shuuji: Not quite.  Tsumugi: Personal differences?  Shuuji: You're a little hotter, but still off the mark... Tsumugi: I-I don't know... Meguru: Geez, just tell us already. Touko: She's not... struggling with something, is she? Like a personal issue, maybe.  Shuuji: Hm, that's probably the closest to it.  Meguru: She said it. Pull yourself together, Senpai. Tsumugi: Are you really alright with things staying as they are now? Shuuji: No... I'm not. Shuuji: Heck, this situation is pretty painful on me too. Meguru: Then you know exactly what to do! Tsumugi: Yeah! If you're not satisfied, then you gotta change things! Touko: I don't think deep thought is the answer to everything. Sometimes you just need to clash with your raw emotions.  Shuuji: ...... Touko: It's getting dark out, so I think we should go ahead and call it a day. What do you guys think? Meguru: I agree. We probably won't be getting any students this late.  Tsumugi: Alright, we're gonna go ahead and leave, if that's okay.  Nene: Huh? Wait, huh? Meguru, Tsumugi, Touko: See you tomorrow. Nene: U-Umm... wait... Nene: ...... Nene: Okay... Let's end club for today. I'll go on home after I've locked up, but you can go on and leave now if you want.  Shuuji: That's fine. I'll wait for you.  Nene: ...Huh? Shuuji: I want to talk about something.  Nene: No, I'm alright. It still feels pleasant enough. Shuuji: Alright. I'll walk you home, then. Nene: Do you want to discuss this thing along the way?  Shuuji: Yeah. We can't really talk in private here since there might be kids leaving school from extracurriculars. Nene: Ah, that's true. Shuuji: ...... Nene: Umm... We've already reached my apartment. Did you still want to talk about whatever it was...? Shuuji: Yeah, about that... Shuuji: I want to put an end to this. Nene: So, you mean... Shuuji: Look... I just can't take this any longer. And it all seems pointless anyways... Nene: Ah... nh... ngh...! Nene: ...... Nene: That would be for the best, for both of us... You and I could move on... Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: ...... Nene: You can't do this... You know... You know what'll happen... Shuuji: I don't care. I'm not letting go. Shuuji: I don't like this dumb little test of endurance either, Nene. Nene: Shuuji-kun... Shuuji: I want to go back to being a couple. So please, Nene... Stay by my side. Nene: But you know if we do that it'll― Shuuji: It hurts a million times more to stay apart from you! Shuuji: You're right in front of my eyes, but you feel so, so far away... All I can do is watch helplessly as you suffer, all alone... Nene: Well, I... I feel the same way. It's just as painful for me... Shuuji: I don't want to lose you like this. I want to touch you, I want to hear your voice... I don't want to give up on you... Shuuji: Actually, it's not a matter of want... I simply can't. Nene: ...... Nene: B-But... Shuuji: Do you still remember my confession?  Nene: Of course. I'll never forget it.  Shuuji: After that, we both evaluated our feelings, came to a mutual conclusion, and started going out.  Shuuji: I love you just as much now as I did then.  Nene: ...... Shuuji: You mean the world to me, Nene. No matter what happens, I'll always love you. Even if you came to hate me, for some reason, my feelings for you would remain the same.  Nene: Why are you saying these things to me... You're so cruel... Nene: There's no way my feelings would change... I love you. You know how much I love you! Shuuji: I do. I've been able to feel the pain you've been feeling all this time.  Shuuji: I'm so sorry, Nene... I should've done this much sooner. Shuuji: Let's stop trying to fool ourselves. It makes no sense for us to force ourselves apart when we both love each other.  Nene: But, we can't... Shuuji: I want the person I love to be smiling. The last thing I want are memories of you frowning... looking like you're about to cry.  Shuuji: Spending time with you is the greatest thing in the world to me, but what does that mean if we're just ignoring each other? I've come to realize that over these past few days.  Nene: ...... Shuuji: I want to be with you, Nene. Those are my true and honest feelings. You don't have to worry about hurting me or anything. Shuuji: All I want is to know what you feel. If you think being with me will be too painful to bear, then I'll give up. But if you want to be with me... Nene: We can't... I'll only make you suffer in the process... Shuuji: I've been telling you, it's ten times more painful for me now.  Nene: If we go back to being a couple... You know we'll have less time together... Shuuji: There's no point in having more time if it means I can't spend every moment of it with you.  Nene: I'm a hypocrite, through and through. I told you I wanted you to keep loving me... yet I was the first to give up on you. I even suggested breaking up... Shuuji: Well, I'm not much better, Nene... It took me this long to do this. I made you wait for all that time.  Nene: ...... Shuuji: Is that everything you wanted to say? I'll talk now, if you don't mind.  Shuuji: I'll always be with you, Nene. I won't ever leave you.  Shuuji: I don't want regret to be the last thing I remember you by. I want you to smile, so let's have fun again. Shuuji: If you thought I'd fall out of love with you over this, then you better think again. I'm not giving up. I'm not the kind of guy you can get rid of that easily.  Nene: ......

Ayachi-san was busy all day dealing with everyone stopping by. Meguru: Nene-senpai, do you think we could just get one quest in together? Nene: I'm sorry, but I really don't feel like playing games after all that... Nene: Besides... Nene: I-It's just you. Right, Hoshina-kun? Shuuji: Yeah, don't be silly. C'mon, you'll get left behind if you don't hurry up. Meguru: ...Hey, don't just gloss over my question like that. Shuuji: We're not glossing over anything. Anyway, where's my bag? Meguru: ...... Meguru: (Is there something going on between them? This is kinda frustrating...) Touko: Okay, I have plans to see a friend now. See you all tomorrow. Tsumugi: Yeah, bye. Tsumugi: How about we all go somewhere too? Or maybe it would be better to go straight home today, huh? Nene: Yes... I would appreciate that. Tsumugi: That's fine! Get plenty of rest. Meguru: ...... Shuuji: Hm? Inaba-san, what's wrong? You don't wanna go home? Meguru: ...Senpai. Meguru: Come with me for a bit! Shuuji: Wha?! Nene: Ah, okay... Meguru: I need to talk to you! Meguru: Oh, our hands... Shuuji: You're just now realizing that? Meguru: Y-Yeah. I just kinda grabbed your hand without thinking. Sorry! Shuuji: It's not like I mind... Shuuji: Umm... So what do you want to talk about? Meguru: Oh, r-right! About that, umm... Shuuji: What? Meguru: I mean y-you're unfair! Meguru: I wanna get along with Nene-senpai too! Shuuji: ...What? Meguru: It feels like you been talking to each other behind everyone's backs! Meguru: You've been talking with THE Nene-senpai! She's cute, pretty, has a great figure, is classy but nice... but she still keeps everyone at a distance. Everyone but you, it seems! Meguru: That's so not fair! Meguru: N-No, I wouldn't go that far. I'd feel bad asking about that... Shuuji: Yeah? Meguru: Senpai, how have you gotten so close with Nene-senpai? Shuuji: Right, umm... Shuuji: Hmm... If you wanna be better friends with her, shouldn't you have gone home with her instead of dragging me off somewhere? Meguru: W-Well yeah, I guess, but... Shuuji: Though, if it were that easy, we wouldn't be here right now. Meguru: Y-Yeah! Right! Shuuji: But you know, the way I see it is that you're the one who's closer to Ayachi-san. Shuuji: It's not like I can hug Ayachi-san like you do. Meguru: Well, no duh! Guys can't just hug girls out of nowhere! That'd be so wrong! Shuuji: Can't exactly say no to that. Ayachi-san is pretty hot... Meguru: Ugh... You're such a creeper sometimes. Seriously, how can you say that? Shuuji: You're the one who asked me that! Any guy would feel the same way. It's not like we act on every urge we get! Meguru: Looking at it the other way around, all I can do is hug her and nothing else. Shuuji: What do you mean by that? Meguru: W-Well, you know... We never chat alone in the clubroom during lunch break, for example. Shuuji: So that really has been weighing on your mind... We didn't talk about anything special there, okay? Meguru: Th-That doesn't make it any less unfair. I'm still just as jealous knowing that! Meguru: Remember what I said yesterday? I just want all of my friendships to be deep. That's why! Shuuji: Hmm... Meguru: But like I just mentioned, Nene-senpai always seems kinda distant, you know? So it's hard to just up and ask her. Meguru: What if she went all, \"You want me to eat lunch with you? Why would I do that?\" I'd die from shock. Shuuji: ...Yeah, that's tough. Shuuji: Okay. I'll do what I can. Meguru: ...!! Shuuji: Err, I think it's a bit early to be thanking me. Meguru: Whatcha mean? Shuuji: While I'd love to help you, I'm not actually sure how I got so close to Ayachi-san. Shuuji: So I don't have a clue where to start. Meguru: What?! Meguru: Th-That's not true! You're like super close! You've even been communicating with eye contact alone! Meguru: That's the whole reason I said this is unfair! Shuuji: Well, I'm glad you think so, but I dunno what to do... Shuuji: Like you said earlier, there's an inherent difference in how we can interact with her since I'm a guy and you're a girl. I doubt my approach would work for you. Meguru: You got close with her in a way only a guy can...? Meguru: W-Wait! Is that why you understand each other so well?! I mean, like, your relationship has gotten ph-ph-physical?! Shuuji: Whoa, whoa! Hold on! You're way off-base! Why are you taking things in that direction?! Meguru: Don't put this on me! You're the one who made it sound like that! Shuuji: I didn't! That was all you! Anyway, just calm down. Let's get some drinks at the vending machine over there. Shuuji: That's what I want to say... *sip* Anyway, that was just a misunderstanding on your part.  Meguru: Yeah, I know. There's no way that'd be true now that I think about it. Shuuji: Would've been nice if you thought that through sooner... Would have saved me some money on the drinks. Meguru: Ah, speaking of, is the milk tea you got any good? I had a hard time deciding between that and this coffee. Shuuji: I'd say it's better than the kind they have at school. Meguru: Hmm... Maybe I should've went with the milk tea instead. Shuuji: Want a taste? Meguru: Of course not! That would be an... i-i-indirect kiss! Shuuji: Oh... Y-Yeah, I guess so. Meguru: Geez, why are you always like this? There's no way a dolt like you could get close with Nene-senpai! Shuuji: Isn't that different from what you said earlier? Meguru: ...So please tell me how you got so close to her while being such a dolt. Shuuji: Err, like I said, I have no idea. Meguru: You are no help at all... Shuuji: Oh, give me a break. Let me think... Meguru: I won't drink that even if you wipe the rim clean. Shuuji: Forget about that already. What I'm saying is... Shuuji: Why not just go and visit Ayachi-san right now? Meguru: ...... Shuuji: And then when you're there, suggest staying the night. Meguru: ...Y-You mean, just me? Shuuji: Of course. You want to get closer to her, right? Meguru: N-No way! Shuuji: You mean you don't want to get closer to her?! Meguru: No, I do! But you want me to stay the night with her?! Meguru: Visiting her by myself would be hard enough for me... Shuuji: And yet you have no qualms hanging out at my place... Meguru: Th-That's because it's you. Meguru: R-Right. Meguru: But, umm, the idea itself is good. Sleeping over at Nene-senpai's place is like a dream for me. Shuuji: Okay, then with that goal in mind, how about you work towards getting closer to her starting tomorrow? Meguru: Ugh... Can I really do this? Shuuji: Well, how about you come and stay over at my place as practice? Meguru: AS IF!! Shuuji: Well, with that settled, let's pick this back up tomorrow. Meguru: O-Okay. See you tomorrow. Meguru: Umm... Thank you, Senpai. Shuuji: You can show your thanks by staying the night at my place. Meguru: What?! Are you serious?! Are you in super-perv Senpai mode right now?! Are you after me or something?! Shuuji: Nah, just kidding. Meguru: You've got a real messed up sense of humor... Taichi: Okay. Take care. Shuuji: ...Good morning. Meguru: Yeah! I figured you'd eventually pass by here. Shuuji: ...Why, though? Meguru: Hey! What kind of reaction is that? Meguru: Didn't you tell me you'd help me yesterday? Shuuji: Oh yeah, I guess that makes sense... Shuuji: Sorry. I was just a little taken aback. Meguru: ...Senpai? Shuuji: Oh, it's nothing. Let's walk while we talk. Meguru: Yeah! Roger that. Shuuji: We'll end up at school in no time if we follow my regular route though. Shuuji: So at the risk of sounding boring, let's take the same detour as yesterday. Shuuji: Should we not have taken a detour? Meguru: No, that was actually a good idea. Meguru: ...It just feels strange heading to school with you. Shuuji: Even though you were waiting to ambush me... Meguru: I-I know. And did you have to put it like that? You make me sound like a bad guy! Shuuji: Anyway, if you have no problem with the detour, then let's get down to business. Shuuji: We need to talk about how you should get closer to Ayachi-san. Meguru: Y-Yeah. Shuuji: So, to make sure, is the goal still being able to sleep over at her place? Meguru: Yeah, we can go with that. Meguru: I kinda got really flustered yesterday, but after thinking about it calmly, it doesn't seem too hard to do. Shuuji: If it's that easy, then can't you do this without my help? Meguru: Th-That's not how I meant it! You can't back out now! You already promised me you'd help! Meguru: Good! Meguru: You know, for how cold you seem, you're surprisingly nice. Shuuji: How am I supposed to take that? Meguru: As a compliment. Shuuji: O-Okay, thanks... Anyhow... Shuuji: The way I see it, getting used to interacting with her is the only way. Meguru: Right. I agree with that. Shuuji: And so, your first step should be― Meguru: Ne... N-N-Nene-senpai! Meguru: Good mornifsh! Nene: It's unusual to see you here in the morning. Meguru: Y-Yesh. Tru dat! Nene: ......?? Meguru: Not at all! Just saying good morninf! Meguru: Hoshina-senpai invited me, so I figured I would swing by... Nene: Okay...? Meguru: Helloha! Nene: ...Yes. Helloha to you as well. Meguru: ...... Nene: ...... "

You mean... Nanao: Your magic overflowed as well, allowing you to interfere with Togakushi-san's heart, correct? And your magic power was weak to begin with. Nanao: A large excess of magic flowed into you. Your power was temporarily enhanced but rendered you unable to control it, which resulted in your magic being completely erased. Shuuji: Then, that means... Nanao: You no longer have the power to sense people's emotions. Shuuji: Really...? Nanao: ...... Nanao: I know you said that you don't think you can socialize well without your power, but try not to be so anxious, okay? Shuuji: Honestly... I don't really know how what's going to happen from here out. Shuuji: Life might get more difficult for me, but I'll cross that bridge when I come to it. Shuuji: This is a fresh start for me. I'm just going to focus on being with Touko-san. Nanao: ...I see. Hehe. Nanao: This has been a good experience for me too. I've always been focused on learning more about humans and becoming one. Nanao: It seems there are things far more important than knowledge if you are to live as a human, however. There's a lot more left for me to research. Shuuji: I've learned some new things too. Shuuji: The reason my mom wanted her magic so badly was all because of one person. I never would've thought... I'm shocked, to be honest. Nanao: Oh, there's one more thing I should tell you, Hoshina-kun... Shuuji: Yeah? Shuuji: I'm so sorry! Nene: Huh? What? U-Umm... What are you sorry about? Shuuji: Well, you know how I took all that magic from you? Souma-san says it's all been erased from inside me. Shuuji: We think it reacted to my emotions and was used up as my own magic power. I'm so, so sorry! Nene: Ah, that's what you mean. You made me think something bad happened. Shuuji: ...Umm, you're not angry? Nene: Would being angry get me my magic back? Shuuji: Oh, uh, well... Nene: Hehe, I'm sorry. That was a mean question. I was just joking. Nene: I'm not angry. I'm just happy that Togakushi-senpai has woken up again. It's no problem at all. Shuuji: Ayachi-san... Nene: And hey. Take a look at this. Shuuji: Really? Nene: You didn't use them all up, Hoshina-kun. You only used a portion. The rest came back here. Nene: Just because you don't have to worry about Togakushi-senpai anymore, it doesn't mean you have to worry about me. Shuuji: But that still means I used up part of your magic. Nene: That's offset by what I've gained since you started helping out with the club. Actually, the number of fragments I have now is only a little lower than when I first met you. Nene: But please, you don't have to worry about me. A lot has happened, but how about we call it even? Shuuji: ...Sure, let's do that. Shuuji: I'm going to keep working at the OC though, even if I don't have anything to make up to you. Nene: Of course. You're more than welcome to. Meguru: Of course there is. We were so worried about you! You were gone for days. Touko: ...Sorry for worrying you so much. Touko: Oh, and thank you for the shawl. It's so cute. I just love it. Meguru: I'm glad you like it, but it's a present from everyone. Tsumugi: But you were the one who decided we should buy her a shawl and picked it out, Meguru-chan. Touko: You have such good taste, Inaba-san. Meguru: Y-You think? Ehehe... Meguru: Hey, today's not about me! We're here to celebrate Togakushi-senpai's return. Nene: That's right. Nene: Speaking of which, I brought some cake. Touko: You did? Shuuji: It came from a great shop that Inaba-san told us about. Meguru: Well, originally a friend from my class told me about it. It's all the rage. Nene: So we asked Hisashima-sensei to let us keep it cool in the staff fridge. Touko: I'm not sure this is something students are allowed to do... But I suppose it's fine for today! Meguru: Yeah! Tsumugi: This is a celebration, after all. Nene: Togakushi-senpai, what's your favorite kind of cake? Touko: I wonder... What do you have? Wow, these all look great! Hmm, I don't know which to go for... Shuuji: ...... Meguru, Tsumugi: ...... Touko: Huh? What is it? Oh, did someone call dibs on the gateau chocolat? Meguru: No, that's not the problem. Tsumugi: Togakushi-senpai, you seem kinda... cheerful? Not that you were gloomy before, but... Meguru: You're more excitable than usual. Not that that's a bad thing. It's super cool that you're happy. Nene: Hoshina-kun, what kind would you like? Shuuji: Oh, I'm good with whatever. You guys pick first. Meguru: Well then... Can I take the shortcake? Tsumugi: Yeah, that's fine. I'll go for... the cheesecake. Nene: I'll have the fruit tart. Touko: That leaves you with the mille-feuille, Shuu-kun. Here. Shuuji: Thank you very much. Shuuji: One more time then. Touko-san... Nene, Tsumugi, Meguru, Shuuji: Congratulations on your recovery! Touko: Yeah! Thanks, everyone. I'm glad to be back. Shuuji: Thanks, Inaba-san. Meguru: Let me guess... You guys spent all day today sucking face to make up for all that lost time? Touko: I-I can't answer that! Touko: ...... Nene, Tsumugi, Meguru: ...... Meguru: I don't know what to say... I didn't expect you to take that seriously. Tsumugi: I thought you'd just smile and go, \"mufufu, that's a secret.\" Nene: Didn't I tell them to refrain from doing that at school? Meguru: Now, now. They're two young lovebirds who've finally reunited. Who are we to stop them? Ehehe... Shuuji: Inaba-san, a girl shouldn't laugh like that. You sound like a dirty old man. Meguru: How dare you! I'm an innocent young maiden! Shuuji: If you're as innocent as you claim, then act like it! Tsumugi: But... You know, you've changed a bit, Togakushi-senpai. Touko: Yeah, I was thinking that I feel a bit different... I've been feeling more restless than usual. Tsumugi: Is that a bad thing? Touko: No. I feel restless, but... it's not all that bad. It makes being with you all even more fun. A-And... Touko: It means I love Shuu-kun even more than before. It's such a happy feeling. Shuuji: ...I'm really happy too. Touko: ...... Shuuji: ...... Touko, Shuuji: Hehehe.\nAhaha. Meguru: ...The cake was more than sweet enough, you two. Tsumugi: Hey now, we should be happy for them. Nene: Just please don't start kissing here. I'll get angry if you do. Shuuji: You really think I'd have the courage to do that here? Nene: Well, that's good then. Meguru: I'm sure that they'll be slobbering all over each other the moment we leave them alone. Shuuji: No we won't! Touko: Y-Yeah. There's no way we could kiss in front of other people. Sheesh. Meguru: That didn't seem to be a problem for you before... Tsumugi: Anyway, come on. Let's eat all this cake before someone comes in to talk to us. Nene: You're right. We should eat up before someone walks in on us... But let's try to savor it. Touko: ...? What is it? Shuuji: Oh, nothing really. Anyway, Touko-san. Touko: Hmm? Yeah? Shuuji: I just remembered... I haven't fulfilled my promise. Touko: What promise? Shuuji: You know, the promise to get you a present. You haven't forgotten, have you? Touko: Ah... You did promise that, didn't you? Back in the clubroom the day I collapsed. You said you'd buy me clothes to commemorate us going out. Shuuji: See? You do remember. Think we can do that over the weekend? Touko: Huh? O-Over the weekend? As in, this upcoming one? Shuuji: Is that a problem? Touko: It's not that I don't want to, but, um... I have a lot to do in preparation. The timing just isn't good, so... Shuuji: Well if you have stuff to do... I guess we'll just have to go another time. Touko: Geez. I told you not to give me those puppy-dog eyes. Touko: Anyway, I want to go on a date with you too, so... Shuuji: Is that a yes? Touko: Y-Yeah... Fine. I'll just have to go about this another way. I've got some studying to do! Shuuji: ...Studying?

            "Shuuji: So we should go with a more straightforward approach, basically?  Touko: Mhm. Honesty and frankness can create quite the impact. Shuuji: I had this vague impression in my mind that rosy, romantic talk was the way to go.  Meguru: I really feel like that differs for everyone. In Hisashima-sensei's case, well... She'd probably just think you're stupid. Tsumugi: Yeah. I probably don't know her as well as you guys, but I can just picture her yelling \"Get to the damn point already.\" Shuuji: Ahh... Yeah. That's definitely in-line with her personality.  Shuuji: I see. Nene: Yes, if you would. Meguru: So, just a question, but is there any sort of breakthrough idea he's gonna get from these? Touko: Hmm, I guess that depends on what positive qualities he has... Touko: Hoshina-kun, you, Ayachi-san and Shiiba-san are in his class, right?  Tsumugi: I am, but I don't know him very well yet... Tsumugi: But from what I've seen, he seems funny and pretty cool.  Nene: He also seems quite proactive. Oh, and he's always smiling.  Shuuji: Yeah, he has a lot of guts at times, surprisingly. Kinda like with this, when he makes up his mind to do something, he gives it 110\\%.  Touko: If you just look at it on paper, it could work out, but... Meguru: The problem being she answered question number 11 with \"Shouldn't happen.\" That seems like a preeetty big hurdle to overcome... Shuuji: Well, it's up to Kaidou to make up his mind after seeing it. I'll go tell him the results in a bit. Tsumugi: So are we basically done for today, then?  Touko: Ah, one thing before that. I need to collect everyone's surveys. Have you guys all filled them out?  Meguru: Uh-huh. Here's mine.  Tsumugi: I did mine too. Just promise me you won't look. I'm a little embarrassed.  Touko: I won't, I won't. There'd be no point in making it anonymous if I did. Just give it to me face down and I'll shuffle it in with the rest. Shuuji: Ahh, crap... Sorry. I forgot to do mine... Touko: Come on now, Hoshina-kun. You gotta keep your promises. Nene: I'm sorry... I actually forgot to do mine too. Touko: Even you did? Meguru: Wow. You never make silly mistakes like forgetting to do something.  Touko: Do you have the surveys on you? Shuuji: Sorry. I think I left mine on my table at home... Touko: Well, nothing we can do about that. Just make sure you get them to me tomorrow after school and I'll take them to the Newspaper Club with the rest. Shuuji: Okay. Nene: Thank you.  Shuuji: Also, she basically lives the life of a single, middle-aged man. Here's a basic summary of her answers.  Shuuji: So do you know what you're gonna do? Hideaki: Nope. But now that I got this information, I'm gonna give it some serious thought. Hideaki: Looking at this stuff, though... Shit, how do I confess? What approach is gonna do me the best... Hideaki: I just hope I find something I can use as a starting point.  Shuuji: Look, you don't have to force yourself to go through with it now because of our help.  Hideaki: Besides, getting it off my chest helped out a lot. I'll be able to think about everything calmly.  Shuuji: Glad to hear. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Just curious... But what exactly does it feel like to love someone so much you feel like you're going crazy?  Hideaki: Well... Didn't I already tell you? You think about that person 24/7 and can't help it.  Hideaki: You want to talk with her, you follow her with your eyes whenever you're around her. You try and think of ways to spend time with her and get jealous over the dumbest things... Hideaki: Frankly speaking, it's all shit that seems pretty creepy when you stop and think about it.  Hideaki: But no matter how weird you think it is, you can't do a damn thing to stop it. When you see her having fun or smiling, it's the sweetest feeling in the world. Shuuji: You find yourself staring at her when she smiles?  Hideaki: Oh, you betcha. Happens all the time.  Shuuji: What about dreams? Do you dream about her too? Hideaki: Occasionally. That happens when you're thinking about her 'round the clock. Awake or asleep doesn't matter.  Shuuji: Hmm... I see... Shuuji: No, no, it's nothing! Hideaki: You're a goddamn open book, I swear.  Shuuji: ...... Hideaki: No need to hide it, man. Nothing embarrassing about being in love with Ayachi-san. Anybody would with a girl that cute around.  Shuuji: It's not like I'm embarrassed about― Shuuji: Wait, how did you narrow it down to Ayachi-san? Hideaki: Oh-ho, what is that I hear? Do you dare try to deny it?  Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: ...Was it that obvious? Hideaki: Definitely. I'd say anyone who knows you a bit better would notice immediately. Shuuji: Well... I guess she doesn't mind me. Shuuji: Well, a lot's happened.  Hideaki: So are you gonna tell her? I can tell you, you're sure as hell not gonna get anywhere if you just keep wracking your brains over it.  Shuuji: ...Hmm. Shuuji: What do you think I should do? Hideaki: That's for you to decide, man. It's your life, not mine.  Shuuji: That's what you say after egging me on to confess? Hideaki: Hahahaha. What I'm basically saying is, give it some serious thought.  Shuuji: Yeah. Hideaki: Oh right. Would you mind letting me return the key? Shuuji: Sure, fine by me... Do you want to talk to Sensei? Hideaki: You're not supposed to say it, man.  Hideaki: We're here to return the key. Kanae: Hm? Ah, right. Thanks. Kanae: But seriously, just what were you two guys doing in there two days in a row? Shuuji: Completely normal things.  Hideaki: Don't go spreading any funny rumors about us now, Kanae-chan. Kanae: Don't call me Kanae-chan. And especially not in the faculty room. Hideaki: Sorry, just a slip of the tongue. Hahaha. Shuuji: ...... "

Tsumugi: Is something wrong, Hoshina-kun? Shuuji: I dunno, the class just seems different than usual.  Wakana: Oh, I know what you mean. Everyone was still hyped up from the party yesterday.

Shuuji: Hmm, that's not really what I was getting at. It's more like... Ah, that's it. Ayachi-san isn't here.  Tsumugi: Nope, she probably isn't here yet. I didn't see her, and yeah... it looks like her bookbag isn't at her desk either.  Wakana: But homeroom starts in just a few minutes. I can't imagine Ayachi-san of all people cutting it this close. Tsumugi: Hmm... you think maybe she overslept? She did seem pretty worn out yesterday.  Wakana: Oh, was she? I didn't notice.  Tsumugi: Yeah. A bunch of people came to our clubroom after school to pester her about joining bands. We went home a little early because of how exhausted she was. Shuuji: Yeah, she seemed pretty fatigued.  Wakana: Oh, that sucks. But if she was that tired, I guess we can't really blame her for oversleeping.  Tsumugi: Yeah, plus she lives by herself. She wouldn't have anyone to wake her up... Wakana: What? She lives by herself? Man, that does sound rough. Shuuji: And I bet she has things she has to do around the house before she leaves for school, so that eats even more time.  Tsumugi: I guess she might actually be late today.  Wakana: Well, if her body needs the rest, then I guess it's for the best.

I'm sure you know that feeling.  Touko: So, if you guys don't mind, would it be alright if I stayed and helped the OC out?  Tsumugi: Only if you count the clubroom.

I'll just tell them that the Occult Club is going to be doing a performance.  Shuuji: Let's hope that's enough to dissuade them.  Tsumugi: No need to worry about it now, you have time. A lot of things can change in a year, so you might as well just worry about it when the time comes.  Shuuji: True. We can't really make predictions about events that far off in the future.  Nene: Still... Just thinking about the possibility is enough to make me depressed... *sigh* Touko: How long do you guys usually stay?  Nene: It can vary depending on things, but generally, I would say we leave around six.  Shuuji: Do you wanna just call it a day now? We can do that. I know several of the sports teams end around this time too.  Touko: Good idea. I imagine Ayachi-san wants to go on home and lay down.

Just doing some shopping before dinner. What're you up to?  Shuuji: I noticed you pacing around for some time.  Nene: Y-You just stood there and watched? Why didn't you come up and say something sooner... Shuuji: Sorry, I was just a little confused, so I wound up staring. Are you out grocery shopping too? Nene: No, not quite. Today was pretty exhausting for me, so I was thinking of maybe going somewhere... Shuuji: Ah, yeah, I feel that. Sometimes you just don't wanna bother with whipping up something yourself.  Shuuji: ...Ramen? Nene: I told you not to look... Shuuji: S-Sorry. But really, I don't see anything to be embarrassed about.  Nene: You really don't think it's... strange or anything? You can't tell me a girl eating at a ramen restaurant all by herself doesn't weird you out.  Shuuji: Oh no, not at all. I don't see anything wrong with it. Nene: O-Oh, well thank you. Nene: It's not something I love, per se... but I've been curious to explore it.  Nene: Do you remember that day when you and I went with Inaba-san to the conveyor-belt sushi restaurant? Shuuji: Yeah, I do.  Nene: Well, it's much the same scenario... I've never actually been to a ramen restaurant before.  Shuuji: Is that so? Shuuji: You're getting cold feet?  Nene: That's right... I looked in and only saw men dining there, so I got scared.  Nene: But the thing is, I'm not sure I'll ever work up the courage to do this again if I walk away... Shuuji: Is trying this ramen that important to you?  Nene: ...Yes. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Umm... would you like me to come with you? Maybe that would help. Nene: Ah, er, wait... I thought you were going to be eating dinner at home.  Shuuji: Nah, it's all good. None of it'll get cold. Shuuji: And all this talk of ramen's gotten me a little curious... You wouldn't mind if I joined you, would you?  Shuuji: Absolutely. Ready to go on in? Nene: Yes! Shuuji: Coming.  Nene: Ramen! Oh, Ramen! Nene: It'll be my first time having real ramen instead of the cheap, instant kind. I can't wait to see how it tastes. Nene: Is that some sort of problem, perhaps?  Shuuji: Well, before we go in, let me check with you: are you aware of what kind of place this is?  Nene: Come again? I thought it was a ramen place. Is it not? Really? But I'm sure I― Shuuji: Weeell, you could SAY it's a ramen place, but that's not quite the full picture... Let's just say it's a bit of special place. Nene: Oh, you don't have to worry about that. I've done my research prior to coming here.  Shuuji: Really?  Nene: Yes. I have it all down pat. Shuuji: Yeah, a few times with Kaidou.  Shuuji: Ah, yes. Just us two.  Clerk: We got two free seats together, so come on and follow me.  Shuuji: Are you ready, Ayachi-san? Nene: Yes! Clerk: How's it goin', y'all! Shuuji: What are you getting? Nene: The extra large char siu. Shuuji: The extra large?  Nene: Am I not allowed to?  Shuuji: Well, you are, but it's gonna be a lot of food. You sure you can handle it?  Nene: Absolutely. It might seem surprising, but I'm actually a large eater.  Shuuji: Oh, really?  Shuuji: ...Are you sure about that? Nene: Huh? Clerk: Er, yeah, absolutely, miss... W-We'll have that out to ya.  Shuuji: A-Ayachi-san, what are you DOING?! Nene: What? Is something the matter?  Shuuji: A-Are you sure you want that? Like, are you REALLY sure you want that?  Nene: Well... is that not the special code that you chant when ordering it? I read on the internet that first-timers should simply stick to ordering it that way. Shuuji: Man oh man... You actually believed that... Nene: Now it's only a matter of time before it comes out and I get to eat it! Oh, I wonder what it'll taste like... I'm so excited♪ Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Yeah, we've already ordered and everything.  Nene: I feel a little bad. My apologies. But still, I'm glad our path's crossed.  Shuuji: Y-You are...? Nene: Absolutely. I've been eager to eat at this place for so, so long. Nene: Plus enjoying meals with others is something I seldom get the chance to do. It's always nice to have company.  Shuuji: O-Ohh... yeah. Shuuji: Yeah, I'm all good.  Shuuji: That exciting for you?  Nene: Oh, yes! I've had my eyes on this restaurant for so, sooo long. But I could never bring myself to come, you see. Nene: Just to put my frustration into perspective for you, if I had waited a tad bit longer, it might've been possible to retrieve fragments from me. Shuuji: Eh, I don't know, that sounds like a bit of an exaggeration.  Nene: I guarantee you it's not. I'm genuinely happy.   Nene: But, just so you know... If you don't want to stay here with me, you don't have to. You're free to leave anytime.  Shuuji: I don't mind. And if anything, I enjoy hanging out with you.  Nene: Huh...?! Umm, what did you― Shuuji: A-Ah, uhm! I just meant that, like, when I'm with you I don't have to worry about my secret, so it makes me feel relaxed, I guess? Or comfortable? Something like that.  Nene: Ah, yes, of course. Don't worry, I fully understand what you're trying to say.  Nene: And also, I enjoy hanging out with you too, Hoshina-kun.  Shuuji: ―――! Nene: ...... Nene: A-Also, I think I ought to thank you. You've really helped me out in a variety of ways.  Shuuji: Oh, no, I'm not looking for thanks. Really, I should be the one apologizing, considering you still haven't gotten back all your fragments.  Nene: No, that's perfectly alright. They are coming back, slowly but surely.  Nene: Ah! It's finally here♪ I finally get to taste real ramen♪ Shuuji: ...... Nene: Umm... What is this?  Shuuji: An extra large char siu ramen with noodles firm and spicy, extra veggies, and extra extra garlic oil. Nene: But, the thing is, I don't see the noodles. Where are they? Shuuji: Beneath that mountain of vegetables somewhere. Nene: ...This isn't ramen like I know it.  Shuuji: Well, this isn't regular ramen. It's the \"Taroumaru\" style of ramen.  Nene: Ramen... Nene: Ah, goodness! I can't mope around like this; That would be a definite breach of the sacred ramen etiquette! I have to start eating.  Shuuji: What?! Sacred ramen etiquette?! Nene: No. I was the one who ordered it, so I'll eat all of it. Well then, without further ado.  Shuuji: Well, at first, yeah. Oh, and you ate the vegetables. That's not part of the ramen.  Shuuji: True.  Shuuji: %130;HOW IN―?! Guest A: Yer frickin' kidding... That lass ate everything, even the soup... Guest B: And she's as slim as a twig?! Guest C: But boy is she a looker... Help, boys, I'm fallin' in love! Nene: D-Do you need something? You're staring at me, and it's making me rather embarrassed.  Nene: Is there something on my face, perhaps?  Shuuji: No, not that. I was just wondering, like... how does that slim body of yours even hold all that food... Guest A: Who IS that girl, seriously?! Guest B: Man, I don't even think I'd be able to eat all that.  Guest C: ...I wanna have an eating contest with her! Nene: ......? The other customers seem to be talking amongst themselves about something. Do you know why?  Shuuji: Probably. They just witnessed the birth of a new legend.  Nene: Huh... A legend, you say...? Nene: That and then some. It was simply delicious. But, ugh... I think I may have overeaten just a little bit.  Shuuji: Just a LITTLE...? Nene: My stomach's so full I might not be able to fit anything else in the rest of the day. It was very worthwhile coming here. Nene: And, of course, I have to thank you for accompanying me.  Shuuji: My pleasure.  Nene: Thanks to you, this won't be nagging at my chest anymore... I feel relieved. Guest B: And she ate so gracefully too... Damn, I'm a jealous man.  Guest C: I wanna challenge her to an eat-off.  Nene: I don't know why... but I feel like we're drawing a lot of attention.  Shuuji: Ah... yeah... Nene: Come on. Shuuji: I-I'm coming... Shuuji: What do you mean?  Nene: Well, so many people were staring at me... So I had the idea that maybe I'd done something disrespectful or rude.  Shuuji: No, you didn't do anything wrong. They were looking at you out of admiration. Nene: But for what reason? All I did was eat a bowl of ramen.  Shuuji: That was no ordinary bowl of ramen, though.  Nene: ......? I'm still somewhat confused, but it's good to know that they at least weren't angry at me, or sneering at me.   Shuuji: Oh, I forgot to ask. How's your stomach? Does it hurt any?  Nene: No, it feels quite fine. The only thing my chest is full of right now is joy and content *siigh*... Nene: What's wrong, Hoshina-kun? Shuuji: Ah, nothing. Glad to hear you liked it; I enjoyed mine too. It was a pretty fun time, all things considered.  Nene: I feel the same. Really, though... It feels like I have fun whatever I'm doing when you're there too.  Shuuji: Wh-Where'd that come from... Could you explain that a little more?  Nene: Well, we have many more members in the club now, and I got to go to the ramen place I've been longing to try. It's just been new experiences day after day... I enjoy my life a lot more.  Shuuji: R-Really? Nene: Yes. That's the honest truth.  Shuuji: Come to think of it, it's the same for me. I've made so many new experiences since joining the club. Hanging out with girls outside of school, participating in a school event, and so on and so forth.  Shuuji: My life would've been a million times duller if I hadn't made the decision to be more social and outgoing.  Nene: Huh? Oh, hardly. I haven't done anything quite that special.  Shuuji: Oh, but you have. Also, not as a repayment or anything, but if you ever feel scared to go someplace alone again... Just ask me, and I'll gladly come with you.  Nene: ...Er, umm... but... Nene: ...... Nene: Can I... hold you to that, then? Shuuji: Of course. Just hit me up whenever.  Nene: Thank you! Haha.  Shuuji: Of course, that's only if you don't mind me tagging along.  Nene: Why would I mind? Remember what I just told you? Every moment is fun when I'm with you.  Shuuji: O-Oh, uh, thanks. Shuuji: I'm in the same boat as you. Ever since I joined the OC, and became friends with you, I've been having so much fun. Nene: ―――! Nene: Th-Thank... you... Nene: Y-Yes. We ended club early today so I could go home and get rested up. It would be disrespectful to the rest of the club members if I stayed out late wandering around town.  Shuuji: Huh? Nene: Look, over there. That has to be her.  Shuuji: Oh, you're right. Shuuji: Yeah, better not disturb them if they're on a date.  Nene: Let's hurry and be on our way before she sees us.  Shuuji: That's the smartest idea, yeah.  Shuuji: Good to hear.  Nene: Make sure you get a good night's rest too, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Sure thing. Well, Ayachi-san, see you at school tomorrow. Goodnight.  Nene: Goodnight.  Nene: ...... Nene: Ack!! Wh-What did I just SAY?! "
