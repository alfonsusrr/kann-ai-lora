            "Meguru: Hey, guess what? I brought cupcakes! Tsumugi, Touko: Oooh♪ Tsumugi: Oh, yeah. Your cookies and pudding were great! I'm sure your cupcakes are good too. Meguru: They turned out pretty well, I think. Alright, here you go, Tsumugi-senpai! Tsumugi: Wow♪ Thanks～ Meguru: Togakushi-senpai, here's yours! Touko: Ooh♪ This is such a wonderful surprise. Thank you. Nene: Can I try one as well? Meguru: Of course you can! I made a ton of 'em. There's no way I'd leave you out!  Meguru: So here, take one! Nene: Thank you very much. I'll have a taste. Shuuji: Oh... Thanks. A girl's homemade cupcake, huh... Meguru: I'm sure you'll like it. Shuuji: You've been pretty cheerful lately, I have to say. Meguru: Yeah, thanks to you. Tsumugi: Oh! It's great, Meguru-chan! Meguru: Really? I'm glad you like it! Touko: It's so moist and fluffy. You didn't just use some pre-packaged mix, right? I can tell you put some real effort into these. The nuts are a great touch. Nene: It's really good, Inaba-san. This tastes just as good as the stuff they sell at bakeries.  Meguru: Wow! Nene-senpai, that's so nice of you to say! Nene: Sh-Shouldn't you sit and eat your own share? Meguru: Oh, well, maybe you should feed me. Just kidding! Nene: ...? What's the matter, Inaba-san? Meguru: Oh, nothing! Meguru: Okay, I'll eat mine now. Nene: Alright, let's call it a day here. Tsumugi: 'Kay! Meguru: Ahaha. You're welcome. Shuuji: Welp, time to head home. Meguru: Ah, Senpai, Senpai. Meguru: Are you free after this? Shuuji: I guess, yeah. Meguru: Then, well... let's go home together! Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Umm... Is this another cupcake? Meguru: Y-You don't want it? Shuuji: Of course I do! I was just surprised. Shuuji: Umm... You went out of your way to make me an extra one? Meguru: ...Well, you're the one I made that promise with. Shuuji: Y-Yeah, I guess. Shuuji: Oh... Meguru: I-I'm the one thanking you, here. Meguru: Come on. Hurry up and eat it. Go, go. Shuuji: Yeah, thanks. I can't wait! Shuuji: No, you did good! It's just a little messy because I can't stop smiling while I eat. Meguru: ...... Shuuji: *munch* *munch* Yeah, it's great. This tastes awesome, Inaba-san. Meguru: ...E-Ehehehe. Meguru: Ah! Now you're making me smile and laugh too, geez! Shuuji: Huh? How is that my fault? Meguru: 'Cuz what kind of dope smiles while they eat? Meguru: You're welcome. Shuuji: Though, to be honest... I wish I had something to drink along with it. It tasted great, but now my mouth is dry. Meguru: Oh... Y-You're right! I'm sorry I didn't think of that! Meguru: Umm, there's a vending machine down the side street we talked on the other day, right? Let's go! Shuuji: Nah, no need to take a detour just for that. I was only half serious, anyway. Meguru: Oh, okay, right... Meguru: Yeah...? Shuuji: I'll take that detour after all. Wanna tag along? I wouldn't mind chatting more with you. Meguru: Ah... Meguru: Yeah! Of course! Meguru: There we go. Meguru: Hm? What's wrong, Senpai? Shuuji: Oh, nothing. Shuuji: For sure. Meguru: That's good. I was afraid you wouldn't want to eat any of my treats anymore. Shuuji: I'd never turn down more treats from you. It'd be awesome if I could have more sometime. Meguru: Roger that. Next time I'll make something easier to eat. Meguru: So... What did you want to talk about now?  Shuuji: Hm? Meguru: Don't \"hm\" me! Didn't you just say you wanted to chat some more? Shuuji: O-Ohh... Right... Meguru: You want to know? Shuuji: Yeah. After getting this involved, I'm kinda curious. I haven't heard any of the details yet. Meguru: Hmm, let's see... Meguru: Nene-senpai kept chatting away about nothing in particular. Shuuji: Oh yeah? Meguru: Other than that, I made dinner to show my thanks for letting me sleep over... Meguru: Oh, right! We also took a bath together! And even better, it was Nene-senpai who invited me for that! Meguru: And before you ask, we didn't wash each other or anything. But man, Nene-senpai has such a nice figure and pretty skin. I'm a girl and was still totally captivated. It's not fair how she gets to be both slender and voluptuous. Shuuji: Y-You don't say... Meguru: Hey, I know that look! You're picturing her right now, aren't you?! You perv! Shuuji: You can't blame me after you're the one who said all that stuff. Shuuji: Erm, I was picturing you this time. Meguru: WHAT?! Wh-Why me?! Meguru: Why would you imagine ME naked?! Compared to Nene-senpai, I'm basically flat! Shuuji: Well, I think you're both really attractive. A flat girl like you can still be hot! Meguru: ―――?! Shuuji: Err, sorry! This has been really rude of me! Forget I said anything! Meguru: W-Will do. I'll try my best! You... You see, jokes like that don't faze me one bit! Shuuji: Huh? R-Right... Meguru: R-Right! Nene-senpai was worried about whether I'm getting along with my classmates!  Shuuji: Ahh... Meguru: Y-Yeah. True, we took a bath together, ate cake together and all that... Meguru: ...... Shuuji: ...Inaba-san? Meguru: I'm sure you're curious about that too, huh? Shuuji: Huh? A-About what? Meguru: About why I decided to get a makeover when entering Himematsu. Shuuji: Well... Meguru: Yeah. Our conversation ended up there. Meguru: I didn't tell her anything. Shuuji: Huh? Meguru: It's a hard subject for me, so I just sorta glossed over it. Shuuji: ...... Meguru: But it makes me wonder if it's been weighing on her mind. And if it's been weighing on your mind as well... Shuuji: Umm...  Didn't you tell us before that you got a makeover to make yourself more approachable? Meguru: I did, and it's true, but I'm talking about what made me want to do that in the first place. Shuuji: O-Oh. Yeah... Meguru: ...... Meguru: Ah... Meguru: O-Okay. It's not a very enjoyable story, though... Ahaha... Shuuji: I don't mind. I'm just happy that you're willing to tell me. Meguru: ...Thank you. Shuuji: Alright. Go ahead. Meguru: She may have been my only one, but we were really close. We were best friends. Shuuji: ...You didn't have any other friends? Meguru: You know how clingy I can be, right? Well, back then, it was even worse. Meguru: I could be myself around Chi-chan, but not any of the other girls... Shuuji: Chi-chan, huh? Meguru: Yeah. Kizuki Chihoko. I always called her Chi-chan. Meguru: She was a very frail and quiet girl. She was a huge bookworm, though, and was super smart. Meguru: I did nothing but read books too, so we had a shared hobby and matching personalities. Meguru: I could tell her all the things that I couldn't tell anyone else. I told her everything... Meguru: ...But maybe that was the problem. Meguru: To make things worse, I tend to jabber on incessantly when I get excited. Meguru: Basically, I'm completely unfettered when it comes to everyone I'm close with... Shuuji: Yeah, I can see that. Meguru: ...... Meguru: Chi-chan stopped coming to school all of a sudden. Shuuji: Huh? Meguru: I had no idea why. She just stopped coming... Meguru: She never answered my calls or texts either. Meguru: After a while of that, I couldn't take it anymore and went over to her place. Meguru: But when I got there... her house was completely vacant. Shuuji: Huh...? Meguru: So I asked our homeroom teacher, but he wouldn't tell me anything. All he would say was that she left our school. Meguru: And now... I still have no idea where Chi-chan is or what she's currently doing... Shuuji: So... what you're saying is that she suddenly moved away and never told you? Meguru: She didn't tell me anything. She wouldn't even answer my texts or calls. Meguru: But I just figured that it made sense. Shuuji: ...Why's that? Meguru: I said something terrible to Chi-chan right before she stopped coming to school. Meguru: \"I can't get along with anyone else, but you're the only friend I want.\" Meguru: \"It's the same for you, right? So let's be friends forever.\" Shuuji: What's so terrible about that? Meguru: But when I think back on it now, I realize how put off she looked when I said that. Meguru: It was almost like I said something revolting to her... Shuuji: ...... Meguru: That's why I figured it must have been my fault that she didn't tell me anything. Meguru: Maybe it hurt her when I told her she didn't have any other friends than me. Meguru: I would say inconsiderate stuff like that and act like a selfish kid around her all the time. Maybe that was too much for her. Meguru: That must be why she disappeared from my life completely... Shuuji: But... Meguru: Partly because I lost my best friend... Meguru: But also, with Chi-chan gone, I was back to being without a single friend I could open up to. Shuuji: Ah... Meguru: So after that, I just became an introverted bookworm. Meguru: I knew I was too annoying to be good at making friends, so I was too scared to ever try again. Meguru: I also felt like I'd never get a friendship like Chi-chan's again, anyway. Meguru: And besides, not even my best friend Chi-chan wanted to be friends with me anymore. Shuuji: ...I see. Meguru: I decided I couldn't let things continue like that. Shuuji: ...... Meguru: I wanted to get good at socializing and tried my best to achieve that. Meguru: So if I were to meet Chi-chan again... I could apologize to her and tell her that I'm different now. Shuuji: ...And that's why you changed yourself when you entered Himematsu. Meguru: Yeah, exactly. Shuuji: I see... Meguru: ...I-I'm sorry. I just ended up spewing some boring, incomprehensible nonsense! Meguru: L-Let's talk about something else! Umm, err, like about MonHun― Shuuji: No. I get exactly how you feel. Shuuji: I've gone through some stuff and struggled to talk to people too. Shuuji: I've always had hardly any friends. The most I could ever muster was some smalltalk with my classmates. I would just wear a fake smile and try not to upset anyone. Shuuji: It got to the point where, just a little while back, my own dad told me I had the eyes of a dead fish. Meguru: Ah... Shuuji: Yeah, you've thought the same, I'm sure. Meguru: N-No! I would never think anything like that! I just thought you look kinda gloomy. Like you didn't have any friends and stuff... Shuuji: Yeah, that doesn't make it much better. Meguru: I'm sorry! Shuuji: It's alright. After all, it's the truth. Shuuji: But, you see, circumstances led me to joining the OC where I got in touch with everyone else's worries. That made me take a closer look at myself, which led to a thought. Meguru: Wh-Which is...? Shuuji: That I couldn't let things continue like that. Meguru: ...... Shuuji: I mean, I couldn't even muster a decent smile. It was so stiff that even I thought I looked gross. Shuuji: That inspired me to change myself. To give myself a more natural smile... Meguru: ...I see. Meguru: So you're... the same as me... Shuuji: Do you understand how I felt? Meguru: Y-Yeah! I totally do! It's almost like you were talking about me! Shuuji: Thanks. That is why I feel like I can understand your situation so well.   Shuuji: ...Thanks for telling me. Meguru: D-Don't thank me! I should thank you... Meguru: You told me about yourself, listened to my story and understood me. I'm so happy... Shuuji: Then that makes two of us. Meguru: Seems so... Ahahaha... Shuuji: ...... Meguru: ...... Shuuji: I-I guess it's about time we go home. Meguru: R-R-Right, we've been talking all evening... Meguru: Th-This is far enough. Meguru: Yeah. It's only a few minutes from here, and the streets are well-lit. Shuuji: Okay. Then I'll head home. See you on Monday, Inaba-san. Meguru: Yeah... Meguru: ...Oh, wait a moment! One last thing. Shuuji: Huh? What's up? Meguru: Umm... I don't know how to put this, but, umm... Meguru: I-I know you think you haven't been able to smile well... Shuuji: ...Huh? Meguru: But... Meguru: Your smile has never felt unpleasant to me! Shuuji: ...... Meguru: Y-Yeah... Hehe... Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Ready to have a taste of mine this time? Shuuji: Ahaha, yeah of course you― Meguru: But... Meguru: ...Can I ask for something else instead? Shuuji: What? L-Like, you want me to drink the rest of your cafe au lait or something? Meguru: ...... Shuuji: ...Inaba-san? Meguru: Meguru. Meguru: Could you, from today on... start calling me by my given name? Shuuji: ...... Meguru: ...... Meguru: N-Never mind! I take that back! Forget I said anything! Shuuji: M-Meguru. Meguru: Ah... Shuuji: Is that what you wanted? Meguru: A-Again. One more time. Shuuji: ...Meguru. Meguru: ～～～!! Shuuji: ...Hellooo Meguru. Meguru: That's me!

I could never tell anyone why, and so everyone around me ended up kinda grossed out... Tsumugi: I was really worried if I'd be able to fit in here, but then I ended up making friends right away.

Now I really want to know. Shuuji: Please, don't worry about it. It's really nothing. Shuuji: I wasn't having dirty thoughts! Shuuji: I just wanted to thank you again for Saturday. That dinner you made was great. Shuuji: My dad loved it too. Touko: Really? I'm glad you liked it so much. I just made it how I like it since I'm used to only cooking for myself. Shuuji: Actually, I wanted to ask you about that. Did anyone teach you how to make that dish? Touko: No. I learned the basics from helping with stuff as a child and home economics class at school... Then I started tweaking it once I started living on my own. Touko: I spent a lot of my free time experimenting with the seasoning and stuff... Why do you ask? Shuuji: Well, you see... Apparently, that stew tasted just like the kind my mom used to make. Touko: Really? Your mom? Shuuji: I don't remember how it tasted myself, but that's what my dad said. Touko: Did he? Maybe I have the same tastes as your mom, then. What a weird coincidence. Shuuji: Yeah, no kidding. I would've liked to have talked to whoever taught you how to make it. Shuuji: No, it's fine. But do you think you could teach me how you made it next time? Touko: Sure, I don't mind at all. Shuuji: Thank you very much. I wouldn't mind you teaching me your other favorite dishes too. Shuuji: I've been wanting to expand my culinary repertoire. Touko: Yeah, sure thing. You probably don't have much room for experimentation when you're cooking for your dad too every day. Touko: When should we do it then? I'm free both today and tomorrow. Shuuji: Oh, there's no need to rush. Just whenever we get the chance is fine.

That! Tsumugi: So, could I have a moment? I just need to tell you something. It won't take that long. Shuuji: Yeah, sure. Tsumugi: So, about Higo-san. Shuuji: It seemed like her heart was wiped clean of anxiety... Was I wrong? Tsumugi: No, it's not that. I was able to retrieve some fragments, just like you suspected. She looks really happy with how things have turned out. Shuuji: Yeah? That's great. Shuuji: So, you were the one who got the fragments this time? Tsumugi: Yeah. I discussed it with Ayachi-san, and she let me have them. Shuuji: So then, do you think you'll have many more fragments to collect? Tsumugi: Yeah... There are some circumstances around it, but it looks like it's going to take a while. *sigh* Tsumugi: Thanks. I really owe you. Shuuji: Don't mention it. Shuuji: Is that all? We should head back to class before the bell rings. Shuuji: Huh? D-Does it? Tsumugi: Am I wrong? I mean, I saw you together this morning. Shuuji: You did? We just happened to see each other at the school gate... You should've said hello if you were there. Tsumugi: I wasn't avoiding you. I just noticed you two out the window. So, are you getting along with her? Shuuji: I mean... yeah, but it's not like she's the only one. Shuuji: You and I get along well too, don't we? Tsumugi: Yeah, we do, but... I seem to see you two hanging out a lot together. Shuuji: Oh... Really? Shuuji: No way! Like I could ever get a girlfriend like her. Tsumugi: That's a little strong... You think she's from a different social class or something? Shuuji: No, that's not what I mean. Tsumugi: Then what do you mean? Actually... Tsumugi: If you think she's too good for you, doesn't that mean that you've given some thought to going out with her? Shuuji: Huh? Well, I wouldn't say that... Tsumugi: I'm right, aren't I?

Wakana: Huh, you want me to do it? Kanae: The answer should be obvious from my lesson. You were listening, weren't you? Come on, give us all the answer. Wakana: Errm, yeah, so basically... Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Haaahh... Kanae: Hey, Hoshina. Is my class so dull that it's putting you to sleep? Shuuji: I beg your pardon. That was a sigh of admiration! I was just in awe at how useful this lesson is. Kanae: Oh? Then you can answer the next question. Kanae: I'm sure you know how to do it, since you seem so moved by my lesson. Shuuji: Oh, I'm sorry. That last question was so impressive that I'm in a daze and can't think straight. Please ask someone else. Kanae: Okay, smart ass. Make sure you listen carefully from now on. Shuuji: Yes, ma'am. I'm very sorry! Nene: Hoshina-kun, is something wrong? You seemed off during class. Shuuji: Oh... Yeah. It's a personal thing. Shuuji: Though, it's nothing big. I shouldn't need any help with this. Don't worry about it. Nene: Are you sure? Shuuji: Yeah, it's fine. I'll make sure it won't get in the way of the club. Nene: You can always take the day off if you need to. Nene: That's what I did when people kept asking me to join their band. It's okay for anyone in our club to take a break. Shuuji: ...Yeah, thanks. I'll think about it. I'll take the day off if I need to. Nene: Yes, please do. Schoolgirl B: Ayachi-san! Can I have a moment? I have to give a presentation in the next class, so I was hoping you could help me with something. Nene: Of course. See you later, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Yeah, later. Classmate Guys: *stare* Shuuji: ...... Nene: What is it? Shuuji: About club today... Sorry, but do you think I could take a day off after all? Nene: Yes, of course you can. Nene: I'll be sure to let everyone know for you. Shuuji: Thanks, and sorry. Nene: Don't worry about it. Please just get some rest. Shuuji: I'll make sure I'm back tomorrow. Nene: Okay. I'll see you then. "

You're the one assigning a decision to either side of it, right? Nene: You could've just as easily assigned the choices to the other sides. Fortune telling is like that in a way. Meguru: I-I see...

            "Touko: Good idea. Let's take a break, everyone. It's not good to strain yourself too much. Tsumugi: Nnngh! I'm so tired... Shuuji: Mh, nnngh... Touko: It's already this late? We must've been concentrating pretty hard. Shuuji: How about we talk about the party? Would make for a nice change of pace. Touko: That's a good idea. Nene: Then I'll go and make us some more tea. Tsumugi: Thanks, Ayachi-san. Shuuji: Hasn't it gotten a little bit dark in here? Meguru: Let's switch on the lights. Nene-senpai, is it okay to switch on the lights?  Nene: Yes, of course it is. I think I left the remote for the lights somewhere near the sofa.  Meguru: Roger that. Meguru: Remote, remote... Nene: You can't find it? Meguru: Give me a few seconds. Umm... Ah, found it. But... Huh? Shuuji: What's wrong? Meguru: ...It's a little different from the one at my home. It's smaller, and only has a few buttons. Shuuji: Wh-What are you holding there, Inaba-san?! Meguru: Well, the remote for the lights? Meguru: Alright, I'll turn on the lights now. Nene: Wait! Inaba-san! Please wait a moment! Meguru: Yeah? Why? Nene: You. Must. Not. Use. That. Switch! Meguru: Why are you talking like a robot? Nene: Who cares! That's not the right switch! It's for something else! You must not press it! Meguru: Oh, really? Then what's this remote for? It doesn't look like a remote for an air conditioner or TV. What is it? Nene: I-It's a remote detonator! Meguru: A remote detonator?! Nene: This room will explode if you press that button! You'd bomb us all! Meguru: Why would you have such a terrifying switch?! Shuuji: L-Look! O-Over here! Isn't this the remote for the lights?! Shuuji: I'll turn on the lights, so you can come back over here now. Meguru: Okay, thanks. Shuuji: Umm, Ayachi-san, here. Nene: ...Thank you, very much. Shuuji: Yeah, uh, don't worry about it. Shuuji: Anyway... Is this the remote for your egg― Nene: %130;Huh? What did you just say? Shuuji: You can't just keep pretending to be a dense anime protagonist whenever you're in trouble. Nene: God... I hate this. I'm going home... Shuuji: You ARE home. Nene: It's not like you think! It's, umm... for when the arousal sometimes comes on especially strongly... I-I don't use it every time! Shuuji: Uh, I never asked you about that. Calm down. Nene: I-It's all that stupid contract's fault! Shuuji: ...Yeah, okay. The contract. Nene: Yes, the contract. Shuuji: ...... Nene: ...... Nene: I can't take this anymore. This can't be happening. This can't be happening. This can't be happening... Death is the only way out now. Shuuji: Calm down. I haven't said anything. Nene: Your look... Your look says it all. It says that I'm a pervert for using an egg vibrator. Shuuji: I'm not thinking anything like that! Shuuji: Though, I WAS wondering why it was still out... Nene: I-It's not like you think! I'm not actually using it right now or anything! I'm not a pervert! Nene: I DID put it away! The egg itself, at least... But apparently I forgot the remote... Shuuji: So, there isn't anything else you forgot to put away, is there? We're all good now, right? Nene: Umm......... Nene: ........................... Nene: W-We're all good! Shuuji: It took you that long to think about it?! And why do you still sound so unsure?! Meguru: How far have you gotten so far? I don't know, since I've been studying the whole time. Nene: We have booked catering for light food, and we have ordered some inexpensive soft drinks over the internet. Nene: As for the party staff, we've discussed it with the Student Council and are currently making a shift plan. There should be no problems there. Nene: We also ordered the decorations on the internet when we ordered the drinks and got permission from the school to store them there upon delivery. Nene: Our overall plan has been to keep costs low by ordering through online stores that have good discounts. We'll only go out and buy the things we overlooked. Meguru: Ooh... Seems like most everything was taken care of while I wasn't paying attention. Touko: Just like I thought, Ayachi-san is very capable. She's so good at this that my help almost seems unnecessary. Nene: That's not true. I'm only able to be this efficient thanks to all the information you gave us. Nene: Except for the program. Meguru: Have we not made any progress there? Touko: We have. Our school's brass band will play at the party. Meguru: But that alone isn't enough? Nene: I wouldn't say that. But it's hard to tell until we actually hold the party. Touko: The party's main guests will be students, so we don't need anything super showy, but it's hard to tell how they'll feel until the party starts. Touko: At least we don't need a full stage schedule like with the cultural festival. Touko: But, just to be on the safe side, it would be better to have something that would fire everyone up with a whoomph.  Tsumugi: With a \"whoomph\"? Meguru: How about cavalry battle? Shuuji: That would certainly liven things up. If it were the sports festival. Meguru: A hotdog eating contest? Shuuji: Why do you keep bringing up typical sports festival events? Meguru: Then, what about a play? Touko: We did consider that. While it works for a cultural festival, wouldn't it be tiring to focus on the stage for too long at a party? Shuuji: Besides, we wouldn't be able to get the Drama Club to put together a show on such short notice. Nene: The third-years have already retired, so the club has their hands full practicing for next spring's cultural festival. Meguru: I see... Oh! Then how about embrace the Halloween theme and, like, do a candy exchange? Meguru: Everyone has to bring some candy, and then they exchange it with each other. Nene: Isn't exchanging sweets something you do on Christmas rather than Halloween? Shuuji: Giving out candy does fit Halloween... Though, that might be a bit daunting if participation is mandatory. Shuuji: Ideally, we want something everyone can participate in at their leisure, and still fun for those who don't participate... Hmmm... Shuuji: Oh, I know! How about a costume contest? Nene: A costume contest? Shuuji: You said that a lot of students wear Halloween costumes at the party, right? Touko: Yeah, a good number of them do every year. Tsumugi: So, you mean make it mandatory this time? Shuuji: No, that's too much to ask for. Shuuji: I'm talking about voting on who put the most effort into their costume, and who looks best in their costume. Meguru: You mean kinda like a beauty contest? Shuuji: Kinda, yeah. Shuuji: It doesn't have to be as grand, though. You'd need to submit your entry, but you wouldn't have to do anything special like presenting yourself on stage. Also, no separate brackets for girls and boys. Shuuji: And, hmm... As for the prizes, maybe something like school cafeteria meal tickets? We can fit that in our budget, right? Nene: Yes, we certainly do have the budget for that... Shuuji: If it's just casting a vote, everyone could participate no problem. Touko: Oh, yes, that's good. That would certainly liven things up. Tsumugi: If there's nothing weird like a swimsuit contest, I feel like a lot of students might participate. Shuuji: Well... I'm worried if we'll get enough participants, actually. Nene: Yeah, I know what you mean. The party could come around only for there to be no one willing to participate. Touko: You don't need to worry about that. There'll be at least five participants. Shuuji: Huh? Do you know anyone who'd participate? Touko: Yup. They're right here. Shuuji: Right here...? Wait, you mean... Shuuji: One...? Meguru: ...Two? Tsumugi: Three? Nene: Four... Touko: And five! Touko: See? We could at least stop the party from getting too awkward if we participate. Shuuji: Ahh, yeah. Touko: Not at all. You're very necessary. You need to show everyone that guys can participate too. Shuuji: Well, I guess that makes sense. Tsumugi: But that means that us five will definitely have to wear costumes, right? Meguru: More or less, yeah. Tsumugi: You... don't seem very bothered by it. Don't you think it's embarrassing? Or maybe you're an avid cosplayer? Meguru: No, it'll be my first time. I mean, it's a little embarrassing... But don't you think costumes will make the party more fun? Meguru: We'll have to help run the party the whole time anyway, so we might as well have fun with it. Tsumugi: Yeah... I guess. Meguru: Besides, it's not like you have to wear some kind of super sexy costume. Meguru: There'll be a lot of other people wearing costumes, so I think it'd be cool to give it a shot as well. Tsumugi: Well... Yeah, you might have a point. Shuuji: Do you not want to wear a costume, Shiiba-san? Tsumugi: I mean... It's not like I don't want to. It just seems like it'd be really embarrassing. Meguru: We'll be wearing costumes together, Tsumugi-senpai! You hardly ever get a chance like this! Tsumugi: ...... Tsumugi: ...A-As long as the costume isn't too revealing. Meguru: Of course. I don't want to dress in anything embarrassing, myself. Touko: Are you also alright with that, Ayachi-san? Nene: Well... If I don't have to wear anything weird that stands out too much, then I have no objections. Meguru: How are we going to get our costumes? Touko: Ah, leave that to me! I'll get costumes for all of us ready. Nene: Huh? But... Touko: Specifically, I want to ask the Fashion Design Club. So you all don't have to worry about your costumes. Tsumugi: Even if it's the Fashion Design Club, won't it be hard for them to prepare this many costumes on such short notice? Touko: It won't be a problem if I ask them now. I'm friends with the club president there, and she's is always talking about how much she likes making clothes for cute girls. Touko: I'm sure she would love to make costumes for you three. She would probably beg me for the honor and would hate me if I didn't ask her. Nene: Okay... Can you take care of that for us, then? Touko: Yup! You bet! Touko: My, this party is starting to sound so fun. Meguru: You said it! Let's make this the best party ever! Touko: Yeah! Nene: Well then, Inaba-san, we better get back to studying so you can actually attend that party. Meguru: Ugh... I'd rather not be reminded... Nene: We were quite productive today, I'd say. Touko: Yeah, we sure were. That was a great study session! Meguru: My head hurts a little from all the concentrating. Nene: Today would be all for naught if you end up forgetting everything. Make sure you review everything if you want it to stick. Meguru: Ugh... I know. Tsumugi: Ayachi-san, thanks for letting us use your apartment. Nene: Don't thank me. I really enjoyed studying together with everyone. Tsumugi: Yeah, I had a ton of fun too! Shuuji: Thanks for helping me study today. Nene: You're very welcome. Usually it's always you helping me out. Touko: Well, Inaba-san, think you can pass your tests now? Meguru: It's hard to say, but... I'll make sure not to waste Nene-senpai's lessons! Nene: I'm hoping for some good results, Inaba-san. Meguru: Y-Yeah... I'll do my best. Shuuji: Anyway, we shouldn't stand around here chatting forever, so... Tsumugi: Right. See you all on Monday, then. Meguru: Thank you for today, Nene-senpai. Touko: Thanks for having us. Shuuji: Have a nice weekend, Ayachi-san. Nene: Thank you. You too. Touko: I need to take the train, so I'm heading this way. Bye-bye. Meguru: See you. Tsumugi: Thanks for all the help today. Touko: Let's try our best to pass our tests too! Until next week. Shuuji: Yeah, see you at school. Enjoy the rest of your weekend. Shuuji: Alright, you both live in the same direction, right? I've already come this far, so I may as well see you two home. Meguru: You don't have to. My place is just around the corner, and Tsumugi-senpai is with me too. We'll be just fine. Tsumugi: Yeah. I'm happy you want to see us home, but don't you live in the other direction? You've already gone out your way for us enough. There's no need to go even more out of the way. Meguru: Okay, so we'll go the rest of the way alone. Bye! Today was a lot of fun. Tsumugi: It really was. Have a nice weekend. Bye-bye. Shuuji: You too. See you two on Monday. Shuuji: ...Welp, time for me to go home as well. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Man, I really am acting strange. I've never really cared about a school event before. Wakana: ...Oh, Hoshina? Shuuji: Kariya? What are you doing here? Wakana: I'm going home from guitar practice. Shuuji: Out practicing this close to midterms, huh? Wakana: Well, you know, I just needed a change of pace. Hahaha... *sigh* Wakana: As if! I'm not brave enough for that. I'm renting a rehearsal studio. Shuuji: Can you do that by yourself? I always figured that was something only bands could do. Wakana: Rehearsal studios come in all shapes and forms. A lot of places rent out small studios for solo practice. That's the kind I'm renting. Wakana: I've got some cash to play around with thanks to my job at the cafe, so sometimes I rent out a rehearsal studio where I can go all out with an amp. Shuuji: You don't do street performance? Wakana: Oh, please. I'm really not brave enough for that. And it seems like it'd be a real pain in the butt. Shuuji: Then how about forming a band? Wakana: I'm just a hobbyist. I mean, sure, I'm getting some decent practice in now that I bought my own guitar, but still. Shuuji: You've been at this for a while, though. It's been a few years, right? Wakana: Well, yeah. It has. Shuuji: Hmm... Shuuji: How about testing the waters a little? Wakana: Huh? What are you talking about? Shuuji: Want to try showing off your guitar skills in front of some fellow students? Wakana: Some fellow students...? What do you mean by that? What're you talking about? "

Now I really want to know. Shuuji: Please, don't worry about it. It's really nothing. Shuuji: I wasn't having dirty thoughts! Shuuji: I just wanted to thank you again for Saturday. That dinner you made was great. Shuuji: My dad loved it too. Touko: Really? I'm glad you liked it so much. I just made it how I like it since I'm used to only cooking for myself. Shuuji: Actually, I wanted to ask you about that. Did anyone teach you how to make that dish? Touko: No. I learned the basics from helping with stuff as a child and home economics class at school... Then I started tweaking it once I started living on my own. Touko: I spent a lot of my free time experimenting with the seasoning and stuff... Why do you ask? Shuuji: Well, you see... Apparently, that stew tasted just like the kind my mom used to make. Touko: Really? Your mom? Shuuji: I don't remember how it tasted myself, but that's what my dad said. Touko: Did he? Maybe I have the same tastes as your mom, then. What a weird coincidence. Shuuji: Yeah, no kidding. I would've liked to have talked to whoever taught you how to make it. Shuuji: No, it's fine. But do you think you could teach me how you made it next time? Touko: Sure, I don't mind at all. Shuuji: Thank you very much. I wouldn't mind you teaching me your other favorite dishes too. Shuuji: I've been wanting to expand my culinary repertoire. Touko: Yeah, sure thing. You probably don't have much room for experimentation when you're cooking for your dad too every day. Touko: When should we do it then? I'm free both today and tomorrow. Shuuji: Oh, there's no need to rush. Just whenever we get the chance is fine. Touko: Well then, let me know whenever you have a free day. Shuuji: Yup, will do. Shuuji: Oh, no. Not at all. Touko: Hmm... Touko: Oh, nothing. Don't worry. I was just thinking what a nice morning it is. Shuuji: Ah, yeah, the weather is great today. It's gotten chilly recently, so it's nice to see the sun out. Touko: That's not what I meant. Mufufu.

Let's kick butt today! Shuuji: Huh?! Oh, w-woo... Touko: Ehehe♪ Upperclassman E: Morning, Togakushi-san. Touko: Morning. Upperclassman E: You look like you're in a good mood. Something happen? Touko: Kinda, hehe. Touko: Oh right. Mind answering a question for me? Upperclassman E: Y-You mean me?! O-Of course! Ask me anything! Touko: Do you think I'm attractive? Upperclassman E: Of course I do! You're so kind and cute! And, um... in a lot of other ways too! Touko: Mm... Upperclassman E: ...? Togakushi-san? Touko: Yeah, that's the kind of response I expect. Totally normal. Touko: Thanks. That was helpful. Later. Upperclassman E: Huh? Umm... What was that about? Tsumugi: Morning, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Morning. Tsumugi: ...Are you okay? Do you have a fever or something? Shuuji: What makes you think I would? Tsumugi: Well, 'cuz of your red face? Do you feel okay? Shuuji: I-It's red? Um, I don't feel sick... Tsumugi: Even though it's November? Something's definitely wrong with you. Do you need to go to the infirmary? Shuuji: No, I feel fine. I'll go there if I start feeling sick in class. Tsumugi: Don't push yourself too hard. I can take you there if you'd like. Shuuji: Thanks, but I'm okay for now. Tsumugi: Oh, right. On another note, there's something I have to report to you. Shuuji: Huh? What is it? Tsumugi: Errm... Shuuji: Is this something other people shouldn't hear? Tsumugi: Yeah, kinda. It's about the, you know, thing with Higo-san. Shuuji: The thing with... Ohh! That! Tsumugi: So, could I have a moment? I just need to tell you something. It won't take that long. Shuuji: Yeah, sure. Tsumugi: So, about Higo-san. Shuuji: It seemed like her heart was wiped clean of anxiety... Was I wrong? Tsumugi: No, it's not that. I was able to retrieve some fragments, just like you suspected. She looks really happy with how things have turned out. Shuuji: Yeah? That's great. Shuuji: So, you were the one who got the fragments this time? Tsumugi: Yeah. I discussed it with Ayachi-san, and she let me have them. Shuuji: So then, do you think you'll have many more fragments to collect? Tsumugi: Yeah... There are some circumstances around it, but it looks like it's going to take a while. *sigh* Tsumugi: Thanks. I really owe you. Shuuji: Don't mention it. Shuuji: Is that all? We should head back to class before the bell rings. Shuuji: Huh? D-Does it? Tsumugi: Am I wrong? I mean, I saw you together this morning. Shuuji: You did? We just happened to see each other at the school gate... You should've said hello if you were there. Tsumugi: I wasn't avoiding you. I just noticed you two out the window. So, are you getting along with her? Shuuji: I mean... yeah, but it's not like she's the only one. Shuuji: You and I get along well too, don't we? Tsumugi: Yeah, we do, but... I seem to see you two hanging out a lot together. Shuuji: Oh... Really? Shuuji: No way! Like I could ever get a girlfriend like her. Tsumugi: That's a little strong... You think she's from a different social class or something? Shuuji: No, that's not what I mean. Tsumugi: Then what do you mean? Actually... Tsumugi: If you think she's too good for you, doesn't that mean that you've given some thought to going out with her? Shuuji: Huh? Well, I wouldn't say that... Tsumugi: I'm right, aren't I? Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Oh, there's the bell. Better hurry! Hisashima-sensei gets pissed when people are even a second late. Tsumugi: She does?! Oh no. We need to hurry! Kanae: And so, it's not just referring to this underlined section. You also need to pay attention to the start of the paragraph. Kanae: While reading this section, pay attention to the words \"in short\" and \"the point is.\" You should be able to arrive at the answer easily. Okay, Kariya. You answer for us. Wakana: Huh, you want me to do it? Kanae: The answer should be obvious from my lesson. You were listening, weren't you? Come on, give us all the answer. Wakana: Errm, yeah, so basically... Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Haaahh... Kanae: Hey, Hoshina. Is my class so dull that it's putting you to sleep? Shuuji: I beg your pardon. That was a sigh of admiration! I was just in awe at how useful this lesson is. Kanae: Oh? Then you can answer the next question. Kanae: I'm sure you know how to do it, since you seem so moved by my lesson. Shuuji: Oh, I'm sorry. That last question was so impressive that I'm in a daze and can't think straight. Please ask someone else. Kanae: Okay, smart ass. Make sure you listen carefully from now on. Shuuji: Yes, ma'am. I'm very sorry! Nene: Hoshina-kun, is something wrong? You seemed off during class. Shuuji: Oh... Yeah. It's a personal thing. Shuuji: Though, it's nothing big. I shouldn't need any help with this. Don't worry about it. Nene: Are you sure? Shuuji: Yeah, it's fine. I'll make sure it won't get in the way of the club. Nene: You can always take the day off if you need to. Nene: That's what I did when people kept asking me to join their band. It's okay for anyone in our club to take a break. Shuuji: ...Yeah, thanks. I'll think about it. I'll take the day off if I need to. Nene: Yes, please do. Schoolgirl B: Ayachi-san! Can I have a moment? I have to give a presentation in the next class, so I was hoping you could help me with something. Nene: Of course. See you later, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Yeah, later. Classmate Guys: *stare* Shuuji: ...... Nene: What is it? Shuuji: About club today... Sorry, but do you think I could take a day off after all? Nene: Yes, of course you can. Nene: I'll be sure to let everyone know for you. Shuuji: Thanks, and sorry. Nene: Don't worry about it. Please just get some rest. Shuuji: I'll make sure I'm back tomorrow. Nene: Okay. I'll see you then. "

Wakana: Man, what happened to her... Really? Hideaki: Did she not tell you anything, man? Shuuji: Nope.  Wakana: Have you texted her?  Shuuji: I was actually just going to do that... Wakana: Ah, Ayachi-san. Hey.  Tsumugi: What took so long? You're pretty late today.  Nene: There was just a little place I had to swing by before coming to school.  Hideaki: Good to hear. We were worried you might be sick.  Nene: I'm sorry I got you so concerned. It really was only that, so you don't need to worry.  Wakana: Hmm, but aren't your eyes a little red?  Nene: Are they? I got plenty of sleep last night... Well, maybe I just read for a bit too long. Tsumugi: Make sure to take care of your body. Reading is all fine and good, but remember to take breaks.  Nene: Thank you. I'll be careful about that. Shuuji: Ah, yeah, morning. Nene: I need to apologize for yesterday. I fell asleep without giving you a reply text.  Shuuji: Nah, I don't mind. But are you really alright? You can tell me if something's up. Nene: No, that's not the case. I'm fine. So don't worry. Shuuji: ...... Nene: Huh? What, um, makes you say that? Shuuji: Oh, I just smelled coffee on you. Was I wrong? Nene: ...No, you weren't. I had to talk to Nanao. Shuuji: An extension of the talk from yesterday?  Nene: It wasn't anything worth mentioning. But anyhow, I have something to tell you... Shuuji: ......? What is it? Nene: (I made lunch for us again, so come to the clubroom during lunch break.) Shuuji: O-Okay. Got it. Shuuji: Thanks, Nene. Nene: I put my best effort into it, so everything should taste fine.  Shuuji: Thanks. I'm gonna go ahead and get started, if you don't mind.  Nene: Umm, if you could wait one moment before that. Shuuji: Huh? I... can eat it, right?  Nene: Of course. I made it so you could, but well... Before you start eating, do you remember what you mentioned to me last time? Shuuji: No, what did I say?  Nene: Umm... You wanted me to feed you. Shuuji: Oh, right. Now that you mention it, I did say that. Shuuji: Are you saying... You'd actually be willing to do that?  Nene: If it's something you truly want, then... I'd like to make you happy.  Nene: We've already done all the things I barred us from doing back then―kissing, hugging, and holding hands―but I remembered that feeding you was also one of those.  Shuuji: ...... Nene: Ah! If you have more you'd like to do, don't hesitate to say so. I'm ready to do anything I can. Nene: Or alternatively, if you get the urge to any of the things we've already done again... I wouldn't mind that either.  Shuuji: Th-Thanks. I'll keep that in mind.  Nene: So... Do you want me to feed you? Or no? Shuuji: Well, since you offered... I guess I'll take you up on that.  Nene: Of course. Well, then... What do you want first? Are the omelet rolls fine?  Shuuji: Sure, I'll have one.  Nene: Alright. Now say \"ahhhhh.\" Shuuji: Ahhhh. Nene: That's wonderful. Shuuji: Okay, that means it's my turn to feed you now. Umm, if you'll let me.  Nene: What?! I-I have to do that... too? Shuuji: You don't want to? Nene: Urk... D-Do you really want to feed me? Shuuji: Yeah, I really do.  Nene: ...O-Okay. If you're ready, then... A-Ahhhh... Shuuji: Here you go. Nene: Nmhh... *munch* *munch*... Nene: It's too embarrassing opening your mouth this wide at someone. It feels vulgar. I've never done something like that be― Nene: ―Or I guess I actually have. Just the other day... I had to put your big, thick thing in my... Back then, my mouth was open really wide... Nene: G-Gosh! Don't make me say weird stuff while we're eating! Now it's in my head! Shuuji: How did you even get there from something as simple as \"opening your mouth\"?! I swear, you're worse than some horny boy in puberty! Nene: Ugh... urk... Fine. Let's stop talking about this and get back to our food.  Nene: You're very welcome.  Shuuji: It was absolutely delicious.  Nene: Hearing that makes it all worth it.  Nene: Is there anything else you want to do now that we're here? I-If you... want to, we could even do... s-sexual things. Shuuji: What?! U-Umm... so... y-you really mean that? Nene: ......... Nene: Wh-Why not?  Shuuji: You get too embarrassed about it.  Nene: I'm embarrassed right now too! But, well... Girls like to have sex too... And I have as much interest in it as the average person.  Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Can I start with a kiss?  Nene: S-Sure. Of course you can... I'd never refuse a kiss from my boyfriend... Nene: Mh, mh, fuuh... *kiss* *kiss* mh *kiss* Shuuji: *kiss*... I love you, Nene. Nene: Nmh *kiss* mhh, I love you, too... I love you so, so much... mh, mhhh *kiss* Nene: Umm... Is something the matter? Why did you stop? Shuuji: ...... Nene: Are you okay, Shuuji-kun? Nene: Was my kiss... bad, perhaps? I'm really sorry... I'm a beginner, so I'm still learning. And well, it's not something you can just practice in your free time. Shuuji: No, not that. Nene: Was it the lunch, then? Shuuji: No, it was great. I meant what I said. Nene: ...Then what? If there's something bothering you, you can tell me.  Shuuji: ...... Nene: You... don't want to? Is it something I wouldn't be able to help with? Nene: You've so much for me already... I want to be able to help the person I love, too. Nene: Am I not good enough? Can I not support you?  Shuuji: Nene, you're not acting yourself. Forget about me, are you okay?  Nene: ...... Shuuji: Something happened, didn't it? You wouldn't normally be in tears after a kiss.  Nene: Huh? Nene: Of course not. I'd never think of it.  Shuuji: Then do you not love me anymore? Nene: No, that's purely impossible. I only come to love you more and more with each passing day.  Shuuji: Then why are you crying, Nene? Nene: Well, umm... Shuuji: You look so sad. It's like... You're desperately trying to be useful to me. Like you think I don't like you or something.  Nene: ......... Shuuji: I'm sorry for being so persistent. It's just... I felt like I'd only keep hurting you if I didn't say anything.  Shuuji: So please, tell me... Is there something about being with me that's causing you pain? Nene: ...No, no, there's nothing like that. I'm the one who needs to apologize to you.  Shuuji: Why?  Nene: I'm sorry. I'm just... so, so sorry.  Shuuji: ...It's okay, Nene. Just take a deep breath and calm down.  Nene: I'm sorry... I promise I really do want to be with you. I love you. I really do. Nene: But that's exactly what makes it so... Nene: ...Right. Shuuji: Good evening. Nanao: Hoshina-kun. And... Nene. Nene: ...... Nanao: ...Alright.  Nanao: Give me a few minutes to put away the signboard and close up the shop. This might take a bit of time.  Shuuji: ...Sure. Nanao: Alright then, hope I didn't keep you waiting for too long. So, where should we start? Have you told him anything, Nene? Nene: No. Nanao: Okay... I'll start from the beginning, then. Though, a lot of this you might already know, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Okay.  Nanao: So first off, let's recap what we went over yesterday... The remaining fragments in you will eventually return to Nene on their own.  Nanao: When that happens, Nene's will reach the amount necessary to fill her bottle.  Shuuji: Yeah, I remember that. And that means she can have her wish granted?  Nanao: Yep, exactly.  Shuuji: So why is she acting so grief-stricken if her wish is coming true?  Nanao: ...... Nanao: ...Do you know what exactly her wish is? Shuuji: Hm, not the fine details or anything. Just that it's related to her parents' divorce. Nanao: Yeah, that's the gist of it. The exact wish was \"I want to reverse my parents' divorce and redo things as a family, without any fighting.\" Shuuji: Okay... So what about it? Nanao: ...Think closely about what exactly that wish entails. Shuuji: ...... Nanao: ...As you know, Nene's parents are already divorced. So what Nene wished for was for their divorce, which occurred years ago, to have never happened.  Nanao: See, what she wants isn't for them to reconcile and come back together. Nanao: She herself also has regrets with regards to how she treated her step-mother. So, that \"redo\" she wants will involve her own self, as well as her parents. I'm sure you see where this is going... Nanao: Once the necessary fragment amount is reached, Nene will more than likely undergo a time travel in the process of her wish becoming reality. Shuuji: A time travel? Nanao: Or do they call it a time leap? Anyhow, I'm assuming she'll return to a time in the past when her parents were yet to be divorced.   Nene: ......... Shuuji: So if she goes back in time to redo things... Then what happens to us in the present right now? Nanao: Probably nothing at all will change. With the exception of Nene, that is. Shuuji: So, wait... What happens to the Nene living here with us right now? Nanao: ...... Nanao: ...She'll disappear. Shuuji: What...? Nanao: Ayachi Nene's very existence will be erased from this world. Shuuji: ...What do you mean, erased? Nanao: Even if we assume that only her consciousness travels back in time, it would lead to a time paradox, since we'd have a Nene still here whose wish had never been granted.  Nanao: And order to get rid of that contradiction, the magic will likely have to forcibly alter the time continuum of our world... Erasing Nene in the process.  Shuuji: Hold on a second! Is that really what...?! Nene, Nanao: \"......\" Nanao: I only know as much as you do. But we can be certain that she'll be erased from the memories of every single person that knew her.  Shuuji: From their memories...? Does that also include me? Nanao: ...It does. The one unknown factor is what'll happen to Nene's body if it stays here.  Nanao: She might be rewritten as a completely different person, or even transplanted to an entirely different place on the globe... Heck, her body might just disappear completely. Shuuji: No way... Shuuji: Is there no way to cancel the contract, or change it... or anything? Nanao: ...Of course not. The magic engraved itself into her very soul the moment she signed that contract. Nanao: Once the mana it needs is there, it'll probably go ahead and activate on its own... And before we know it, Nene will be gone.  Nanao: The foundation of this magic, the very thing that allows them to exist and grow, is strong, deep desires from the heart.   Nanao: When Nene found me and made the contract, she had no one. It was a few years after the divorce, and she was having trouble fitting in with her new family. She felt unwanted, like she had no place to belong in this world.  Nanao: Her very person and identity revolved around her intense desire to \"go back\" and \"redo\" things. You can't change the magic at this point. It's already formed... Nene: ...... Nene: No! It's in no way your fault... It was me... I should've known better than to make such a careless wish... Nene: You've done so much thus far, all for me. And... It makes me happy to see the person you've become.  "

Tsumugi: Fweeeh, that sounds painful. Nanao: Don't get the wrong idea. We've just occasionally sat down to discuss things in the past.

Akagi: What?! Akagi: Only a witch could gather up that many heart fragments, right?! AND he can see other witches too! Akagi: Right? Ugh, why won't anyone respond to me?! Stop ignoring me, all of you! Tsumugi: ...Could those heart fragments be what you were talking about the other day? Shuuji: Yeah, I think so. Shuuji: This is a huge misunderstanding. I'm not a witch. You see... Tsumugi: Now that you mention it, it doesn't. Shuuji: Oh, sorry... Shuuji: No, hold on. I'll explain that now too― Akagi: No, I tire of your explanations! And I find it hard to believe you would suddenly reveal something you have kept hidden all this time. Tsumugi: Akagi, how about you calm down and listen to what Hoshina-kun has to say? Akagi: Tsumugi, you mustn't allow yourself to get carried away by his male cajolery! We will finish things here at once! Tsumugi: Huh? What do you mean by that? Akagi: Naturally, I mean we are going to steal all of Nanao's witches' heart fragments! Tsumugi: Whaaaat?! Akagi: When we do, you'll have no more business here. I'll leave this area, and Nanao, bound by her rules, will not be able to follow me. Akagi: It will be my total victory! Hah hah hah hah hah! Tsumugi: No way! I wouldn't do that in a million years! I told you, these are my friends! Akagi: Do not be so naive! We have every right to do this, do we not? Akagi: Nanao violated the rules! And she treats me like a fool, so I have never liked her anyway. Tsumugi: I'm not doing this, Akagi. Tsumugi: Have you even thought about what would happen if we lost? Akagi: Grr... A-All you have to do is win, Tsumugi! Go, do it! Get the preemptive strike! Nene: *sigh* Nanao, what should we do? Nanao: As I've told you before... Nanao: I'm leaving this up to you. You witches can decide how to handle this. Akagi: Oh, planning to run off and abandon your witch? Nanao: I've yet to see a witch better than my own.

You had this really serious look on your face. You guys didn't have a fight or something, did you? Shuuji: Oh no, we didn't. We're still on good terms, so don't worry. Tsumugi: That's a relief then... But know that you can always come and talk to me if you have a problem. Shuuji: Thanks, Shiiba-san. Hideaki: Yeah, it's weird. Though, there was that day a week or two ago when she got sick... Maybe it came back? Tsumugi: Who can say. It was only a stomach ache, though, so I don't think it'd be that again. Wakana: Man, what happened to her... Really? Hideaki: Did she not tell you anything, man? Shuuji: Nope.  Wakana: Have you texted her?  Shuuji: I was actually just going to do that... Wakana: Ah, Ayachi-san. Hey.  Tsumugi: What took so long? You're pretty late today.  Nene: There was just a little place I had to swing by before coming to school.  Hideaki: Good to hear. We were worried you might be sick.  Nene: I'm sorry I got you so concerned. It really was only that, so you don't need to worry.  Wakana: Hmm, but aren't your eyes a little red?  Nene: Are they? I got plenty of sleep last night... Well, maybe I just read for a bit too long. Tsumugi: Make sure to take care of your body. Reading is all fine and good, but remember to take breaks.  Nene: Thank you. I'll be careful about that. Shuuji: Ah, yeah, morning. Nene: I need to apologize for yesterday. I fell asleep without giving you a reply text.  Shuuji: Nah, I don't mind. But are you really alright? You can tell me if something's up. Nene: No, that's not the case. I'm fine. So don't worry. Shuuji: ...... Nene: Huh? What, um, makes you say that? Shuuji: Oh, I just smelled coffee on you. Was I wrong? Nene: ...No, you weren't. I had to talk to Nanao. Shuuji: An extension of the talk from yesterday?  Nene: It wasn't anything worth mentioning. But anyhow, I have something to tell you... Shuuji: ......? What is it? Nene: (I made lunch for us again, so come to the clubroom during lunch break.) Shuuji: O-Okay. Got it. Shuuji: Thanks, Nene. Nene: I put my best effort into it, so everything should taste fine.  Shuuji: Thanks. I'm gonna go ahead and get started, if you don't mind.  Nene: Umm, if you could wait one moment before that. Shuuji: Huh? I... can eat it, right?  Nene: Of course. I made it so you could, but well... Before you start eating, do you remember what you mentioned to me last time? Shuuji: No, what did I say?  Nene: Umm... You wanted me to feed you. Shuuji: Oh, right. Now that you mention it, I did say that. Shuuji: Are you saying... You'd actually be willing to do that?  Nene: If it's something you truly want, then... I'd like to make you happy.  Nene: We've already done all the things I barred us from doing back then―kissing, hugging, and holding hands―but I remembered that feeding you was also one of those.  Shuuji: ...... Nene: Ah! If you have more you'd like to do, don't hesitate to say so. I'm ready to do anything I can. Nene: Or alternatively, if you get the urge to any of the things we've already done again... I wouldn't mind that either.  Shuuji: Th-Thanks. I'll keep that in mind.  Nene: So... Do you want me to feed you? Or no? Shuuji: Well, since you offered... I guess I'll take you up on that.  Nene: Of course. Well, then... What do you want first? Are the omelet rolls fine?  Shuuji: Sure, I'll have one.  Nene: Alright. Now say \"ahhhhh.\" Shuuji: Ahhhh. Nene: That's wonderful. Shuuji: Okay, that means it's my turn to feed you now. Umm, if you'll let me.  Nene: What?! I-I have to do that... too? Shuuji: You don't want to? Nene: Urk... D-Do you really want to feed me? Shuuji: Yeah, I really do.  Nene: ...O-Okay. If you're ready, then... A-Ahhhh... Shuuji: Here you go. Nene: Nmhh... *munch* *munch*... Nene: It's too embarrassing opening your mouth this wide at someone. It feels vulgar. I've never done something like that be― Nene: ―Or I guess I actually have. Just the other day... I had to put your big, thick thing in my... Back then, my mouth was open really wide... Nene: G-Gosh! Don't make me say weird stuff while we're eating! Now it's in my head! Shuuji: How did you even get there from something as simple as \"opening your mouth\"?! I swear, you're worse than some horny boy in puberty! Nene: Ugh... urk... Fine. Let's stop talking about this and get back to our food.  Nene: You're very welcome.  Shuuji: It was absolutely delicious.  Nene: Hearing that makes it all worth it.  Nene: Is there anything else you want to do now that we're here? I-If you... want to, we could even do... s-sexual things. Shuuji: What?! U-Umm... so... y-you really mean that? Nene: ......... Nene: Wh-Why not?  Shuuji: You get too embarrassed about it.  Nene: I'm embarrassed right now too! But, well... Girls like to have sex too... And I have as much interest in it as the average person.  Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Can I start with a kiss?  Nene: S-Sure. Of course you can... I'd never refuse a kiss from my boyfriend... Nene: Mh, mh, fuuh... *kiss* *kiss* mh *kiss* Shuuji: *kiss*... I love you, Nene. Nene: Nmh *kiss* mhh, I love you, too... I love you so, so much... mh, mhhh *kiss* Nene: Umm... Is something the matter? Why did you stop? Shuuji: ...... Nene: Are you okay, Shuuji-kun? Nene: Was my kiss... bad, perhaps? I'm really sorry... I'm a beginner, so I'm still learning. And well, it's not something you can just practice in your free time. Shuuji: No, not that. Nene: Was it the lunch, then? Shuuji: No, it was great. I meant what I said. Nene: ...Then what? If there's something bothering you, you can tell me.  Shuuji: ...... Nene: You... don't want to? Is it something I wouldn't be able to help with? Nene: You've so much for me already... I want to be able to help the person I love, too. Nene: Am I not good enough? Can I not support you?  Shuuji: Nene, you're not acting yourself. Forget about me, are you okay?  Nene: ...... Shuuji: Something happened, didn't it? You wouldn't normally be in tears after a kiss.  Nene: Huh? Nene: Of course not. I'd never think of it.  Shuuji: Then do you not love me anymore? Nene: No, that's purely impossible. I only come to love you more and more with each passing day.  Shuuji: Then why are you crying, Nene? Nene: Well, umm... Shuuji: You look so sad. It's like... You're desperately trying to be useful to me. Like you think I don't like you or something.  Nene: ......... Shuuji: I'm sorry for being so persistent. It's just... I felt like I'd only keep hurting you if I didn't say anything.  Shuuji: So please, tell me... Is there something about being with me that's causing you pain? Nene: ...No, no, there's nothing like that. I'm the one who needs to apologize to you.  Shuuji: Why?  Nene: I'm sorry. I'm just... so, so sorry.  Shuuji: ...It's okay, Nene. Just take a deep breath and calm down.  Nene: I'm sorry... I promise I really do want to be with you. I love you. I really do. Nene: But that's exactly what makes it so... Nene: ...Right. Shuuji: Good evening. Nanao: Hoshina-kun. And... Nene. Nene: ...... Nanao: ...Alright.  Nanao: Give me a few minutes to put away the signboard and close up the shop. This might take a bit of time.  Shuuji: ...Sure. Nanao: Alright then, hope I didn't keep you waiting for too long. So, where should we start? Have you told him anything, Nene? Nene: No. Nanao: Okay... I'll start from the beginning, then. Though, a lot of this you might already know, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Okay.  Nanao: So first off, let's recap what we went over yesterday... The remaining fragments in you will eventually return to Nene on their own.  Nanao: When that happens, Nene's will reach the amount necessary to fill her bottle.  Shuuji: Yeah, I remember that. And that means she can have her wish granted?  Nanao: Yep, exactly.  Shuuji: So why is she acting so grief-stricken if her wish is coming true?  Nanao: ...... Nanao: ...Do you know what exactly her wish is? Shuuji: Hm, not the fine details or anything. Just that it's related to her parents' divorce. Nanao: Yeah, that's the gist of it. The exact wish was \"I want to reverse my parents' divorce and redo things as a family, without any fighting.\" Shuuji: Okay... So what about it? Nanao: ...Think closely about what exactly that wish entails. Shuuji: ...... Nanao: ...As you know, Nene's parents are already divorced. So what Nene wished for was for their divorce, which occurred years ago, to have never happened.  Nanao: See, what she wants isn't for them to reconcile and come back together. Nanao: She herself also has regrets with regards to how she treated her step-mother. So, that \"redo\" she wants will involve her own self, as well as her parents. I'm sure you see where this is going... Nanao: Once the necessary fragment amount is reached, Nene will more than likely undergo a time travel in the process of her wish becoming reality. Shuuji: A time travel? Nanao: Or do they call it a time leap? Anyhow, I'm assuming she'll return to a time in the past when her parents were yet to be divorced.   Nene: ......... Shuuji: So if she goes back in time to redo things... Then what happens to us in the present right now? Nanao: Probably nothing at all will change. With the exception of Nene, that is. Shuuji: So, wait... What happens to the Nene living here with us right now? Nanao: ...... Nanao: ...She'll disappear. Shuuji: What...? Nanao: Ayachi Nene's very existence will be erased from this world. Shuuji: ...What do you mean, erased? Nanao: Even if we assume that only her consciousness travels back in time, it would lead to a time paradox, since we'd have a Nene still here whose wish had never been granted.  Nanao: And order to get rid of that contradiction, the magic will likely have to forcibly alter the time continuum of our world... Erasing Nene in the process.  Shuuji: Hold on a second! Is that really what...?! Nene, Nanao: \"......\" Nanao: I only know as much as you do. But we can be certain that she'll be erased from the memories of every single person that knew her.  Shuuji: From their memories...? Does that also include me? Nanao: ...It does. The one unknown factor is what'll happen to Nene's body if it stays here.  Nanao: She might be rewritten as a completely different person, or even transplanted to an entirely different place on the globe... Heck, her body might just disappear completely. Shuuji: No way... Shuuji: Is there no way to cancel the contract, or change it... or anything? Nanao: ...Of course not. The magic engraved itself into her very soul the moment she signed that contract. Nanao: Once the mana it needs is there, it'll probably go ahead and activate on its own... And before we know it, Nene will be gone.  Nanao: The foundation of this magic, the very thing that allows them to exist and grow, is strong, deep desires from the heart.   Nanao: When Nene found me and made the contract, she had no one. It was a few years after the divorce, and she was having trouble fitting in with her new family. She felt unwanted, like she had no place to belong in this world.  Nanao: Her very person and identity revolved around her intense desire to \"go back\" and \"redo\" things. You can't change the magic at this point. It's already formed... Nene: ...... Nene: No! It's in no way your fault... It was me... I should've known better than to make such a careless wish... Nene: You've done so much thus far, all for me. And... It makes me happy to see the person you've become.  "

            "Tsumugi: Huh? But it's a girls' clothing store. Shuuji: Yeah, but I thought you might like it. Shuuji: Not at all. Shuuji: Wanna go inside? You might see some other stuff you like. Tsumugi: Hmmm... I don't think I should. Tsumugi: I wouldn't want to start feeling sick inside the store. Shuuji: Wait, that can happen? Tsumugi: It can if I touch them. Tsumugi: Once I'm free of my contract, I'll get to wear and do whatever I want. Tsumugi: So I can have fun just imagining it for now. Shuuji: I see... Shuuji: N-Not really. I was just thinking how rough you have it. Tsumugi: Really? It's probably not as bad as you're thinking. Tsumugi: Alright, now I'm getting pumped up all over again to end that contract. Shuuji: Wow... You're so strong. Tsumugi: Huh? Shuuji: I really admire how proactive you are. Tsumugi: I can be pretty hesitant too though, you know? Shuuji: If I could think like you do, the hole in my heart would be filled in no time. Shuuji: And then I could help you out of your contract even faster. Tsumugi: Hehe, maybe. Tsumugi: You better hurry up and fill in that hole so we can make my dreams come true too. Shuuji: Haha, that's a big responsibility. Shuuji: Anyway, you really do love cute clothes, huh? I remember you saying that you were obsessed with them. Tsumugi: Yeah, and then you doubled over with laughter even though you promised you wouldn't. Shuuji: Ugh, I've learned my lesson. Shuuji: I just never could have imagined that was how you ended up in this situation. Tsumugi: Hehehe. Well, as long as you've learned your lesson. Tsumugi: Actually, I used to dress like a boy when I was little too. Shuuji: Huh? Why's that? Tsumugi: My mom and dad made me. Oh, not in an abusive way or anything, though. Shuuji: Yeah, I figured as much. Tsumugi: But then I gradually started to feel that something was off. Tsumugi: But I still couldn't just suddenly change things. Wearing a skirt felt too cutesy, and it was embarrassing. Tsumugi: I mean, don't you think it's weird if someone changes too suddenly? Shuuji: I guess. I guess you really do have a hesitant side to you. Tsumugi: Hehehe. Told you so. Tsumugi: But the desire to dress like a girl kept bubbling up inside me. Tsumugi: So one day, I just said to heck with it, and completely changed my image. Tsumugi: At long last, I found the perfect outfit and decided to buy it. Shuuji: Is that the part you told me before? Tsumugi: Ahaha, yeah... In the end I bought the clothes, but I wasn't able to wear them. Tsumugi: And this was after I'd already told all my friends that I was going to change my image. Tsumugi: I had to continue dressing like a guy, and I couldn't explain anything. Tsumugi: I was really depressed back then. Shuuji: Did you hate Akagi for that? Tsumugi: Huh? Why would I? Shuuji: I dunno. A lot has gone on between you two, but you seem to get along pretty well now. Tsumugi: That's what led to me meeting you and everyone at the OC. Tsumugi: And you know, Akagi isn't in a great situation here either. Shuuji: You think? Tsumugi: I mean, if she searched for someone who had an actual serious problem, she could have gotten them to work much harder. Tsumugi: Then she'd be able to get way more fragments per person. Shuuji: Right. So the compensation you're paying is only so high because of the interest? Tsumugi: Yeah. I was so disappointed when I learned I missed out on those clothes, I actually started crying. Tsumugi: It's a silly thing to cry about, so I tried to hide it at first. Tsumugi: But she noticed, and that's why she called out to me. Shuuji: You mean Akagi? Tsumugi: Yeah. Also, think about this. Tsumugi: Akagi's always making fun of humans. Tsumugi: But if she really hated us, she wouldn't be collecting fragments to become one, would she? Shuuji: Ah, yeah, now that you mention it... Tsumugi: There must be a reason that Akagi became an alp. Tsumugi: Hehehe, maybe. She's definitely not honest. Tsumugi: But that's the same as you. Shuuji: Is it? Tsumugi: Well, you were lying when you said you wanted to go shopping, weren't you? Shuuji: What?! H-How'd you know? Tsumugi: I knew it! You were so suspicious. Tsumugi: We kept passing by shops that guys would like, and only stopping at the ones I would. Tsumugi: You were saying stuff like that yesterday too. Shuuji: Because you're helping me out, and I'm doing nothing in return. Tsumugi: Huh? I don't think that's true... Do you really feel that way? Shuuji: Y-Yeah. Tsumugi: Okay. Then let's go back to the last store. Shuuji: The mug? Not the accessory box? Tsumugi: If you don't mind... I'd be happy if you bought this for me. Shuuji: I-I'd be delighted to! Tsumugi: Oh, uh, it doesn't matter! Just hurry up and pay. Shuuji: Huh? This is the same mug I bought... but in a different color. Tsumugi: I-I guess you could say that. N-Now you have one you can use at home. Tsumugi: Though, I'd like it if you didn't tell your dad or anyone at school about our matching mugs. Tsumugi: It'd make me happy... if we could have this secret just between the two of us... Shuuji: Y-Yeah... Sure. Tsumugi: Ehehe. Treat it carefully now. I'll be mad if you break it! Shuuji: I won't! I-I could... never break a gift from you. Tsumugi: O-Oh, really? I-I couldn't break a gift from you either. Tsumugi: Ehehehe. Tsumugi: Huh? Are you sure...? Shuuji: It's dark already. It'll be safer this way. Tsumugi: Yeah, me too. Tsumugi: Huh? Shuuji: What's it doing here? Shuuji: That cloth looks like dog clothing, but it's too big... For a larger dog, I guess? Shuuji: She'd be close by if it did. Puppy: Woof! Shuuji: Whoa, what?! Tsumugi: Hehehe. It seems he's taken a liking to you. Shuuji: Normally, you see the animal taking a liking to the girl in these situations... Shuuji: Anyway, we should look for the owner. We can't just leave a small puppy out here in the cold. Tsumugi: ...Yeah. Shuuji: ...He's small, so maybe he might not have been given one yet. Shuuji: He wasn't in the stereotypical cardboard box you normally see abandoned puppies in. Maybe he wasn't really abandoned. Tsumugi: I hope not... Why do you think he has these dog clothes? Tsumugi: Maybe he went inside them because they smelled like his mom and then got left behind?

Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Can I start with a kiss?  Nene: S-Sure. Of course you can... I'd never refuse a kiss from my boyfriend... Nene: Mh, mh, fuuh... *kiss* *kiss* mh *kiss* Shuuji: *kiss*... I love you, Nene. Nene: Nmh *kiss* mhh, I love you, too... I love you so, so much... mh, mhhh *kiss* Nene: Umm... Is something the matter? Why did you stop? Shuuji: ...... Nene: Are you okay, Shuuji-kun? Nene: Was my kiss... bad, perhaps? I'm really sorry... I'm a beginner, so I'm still learning. And well, it's not something you can just practice in your free time. Shuuji: No, not that. Nene: Was it the lunch, then? Shuuji: No, it was great. I meant what I said. Nene: ...Then what? If there's something bothering you, you can tell me.  Shuuji: ...... Nene: You... don't want to? Is it something I wouldn't be able to help with? Nene: You've so much for me already... I want to be able to help the person I love, too. Nene: Am I not good enough? Can I not support you?  Shuuji: Nene, you're not acting yourself. Forget about me, are you okay?  Nene: ...... Shuuji: Something happened, didn't it? You wouldn't normally be in tears after a kiss.  Nene: Huh? Nene: Of course not. I'd never think of it.  Shuuji: Then do you not love me anymore? Nene: No, that's purely impossible. I only come to love you more and more with each passing day.  Shuuji: Then why are you crying, Nene? Nene: Well, umm... Shuuji: You look so sad. It's like... You're desperately trying to be useful to me. Like you think I don't like you or something.  Nene: ......... Shuuji: I'm sorry for being so persistent. It's just... I felt like I'd only keep hurting you if I didn't say anything.  Shuuji: So please, tell me... Is there something about being with me that's causing you pain? Nene: ...No, no, there's nothing like that. I'm the one who needs to apologize to you.  Shuuji: Why?  Nene: I'm sorry. I'm just... so, so sorry.  Shuuji: ...It's okay, Nene. Just take a deep breath and calm down.  Nene: I'm sorry... I promise I really do want to be with you. I love you. I really do. Nene: But that's exactly what makes it so... Nene: ...Right. Shuuji: Good evening. Nanao: Hoshina-kun. And... Nene. Nene: ...... Nanao: ...Alright.  Nanao: Give me a few minutes to put away the signboard and close up the shop. This might take a bit of time.  Shuuji: ...Sure. Nanao: Alright then, hope I didn't keep you waiting for too long. So, where should we start? Have you told him anything, Nene? Nene: No. Nanao: Okay... I'll start from the beginning, then. Though, a lot of this you might already know, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Okay.  Nanao: So first off, let's recap what we went over yesterday... The remaining fragments in you will eventually return to Nene on their own.  Nanao: When that happens, Nene's will reach the amount necessary to fill her bottle.  Shuuji: Yeah, I remember that. And that means she can have her wish granted?  Nanao: Yep, exactly.  Shuuji: So why is she acting so grief-stricken if her wish is coming true?  Nanao: ...... Nanao: ...Do you know what exactly her wish is? Shuuji: Hm, not the fine details or anything. Just that it's related to her parents' divorce. Nanao: Yeah, that's the gist of it. The exact wish was \"I want to reverse my parents' divorce and redo things as a family, without any fighting.\" Shuuji: Okay... So what about it? Nanao: ...Think closely about what exactly that wish entails. Shuuji: ...... Nanao: ...As you know, Nene's parents are already divorced. So what Nene wished for was for their divorce, which occurred years ago, to have never happened.  Nanao: See, what she wants isn't for them to reconcile and come back together. Nanao: She herself also has regrets with regards to how she treated her step-mother. So, that \"redo\" she wants will involve her own self, as well as her parents. I'm sure you see where this is going... Nanao: Once the necessary fragment amount is reached, Nene will more than likely undergo a time travel in the process of her wish becoming reality. Shuuji: A time travel? Nanao: Or do they call it a time leap? Anyhow, I'm assuming she'll return to a time in the past when her parents were yet to be divorced.   Nene: ......... Shuuji: So if she goes back in time to redo things... Then what happens to us in the present right now? Nanao: Probably nothing at all will change. With the exception of Nene, that is. Shuuji: So, wait... What happens to the Nene living here with us right now? Nanao: ...... Nanao: ...She'll disappear. Shuuji: What...? Nanao: Ayachi Nene's very existence will be erased from this world. Shuuji: ...What do you mean, erased? Nanao: Even if we assume that only her consciousness travels back in time, it would lead to a time paradox, since we'd have a Nene still here whose wish had never been granted.  Nanao: And order to get rid of that contradiction, the magic will likely have to forcibly alter the time continuum of our world... Erasing Nene in the process.  Shuuji: Hold on a second! Is that really what...?! Nene, Nanao: \"......\" Nanao: I only know as much as you do. But we can be certain that she'll be erased from the memories of every single person that knew her.  Shuuji: From their memories...? Does that also include me? Nanao: ...It does. The one unknown factor is what'll happen to Nene's body if it stays here.  Nanao: She might be rewritten as a completely different person, or even transplanted to an entirely different place on the globe... Heck, her body might just disappear completely. Shuuji: No way... Shuuji: Is there no way to cancel the contract, or change it... or anything? Nanao: ...Of course not. The magic engraved itself into her very soul the moment she signed that contract. Nanao: Once the mana it needs is there, it'll probably go ahead and activate on its own... And before we know it, Nene will be gone.  Nanao: The foundation of this magic, the very thing that allows them to exist and grow, is strong, deep desires from the heart.   Nanao: When Nene found me and made the contract, she had no one. It was a few years after the divorce, and she was having trouble fitting in with her new family. She felt unwanted, like she had no place to belong in this world.  Nanao: Her very person and identity revolved around her intense desire to \"go back\" and \"redo\" things. You can't change the magic at this point. It's already formed... Nene: ...... Nene: No! It's in no way your fault... It was me... I should've known better than to make such a careless wish... Nene: You've done so much thus far, all for me. And... It makes me happy to see the person you've become.  "

            "Shuuji: Oh, that's great. Nanao: And also, Hoshina-kun, this is unexpected, but― Shuuji: What is it?! Is there another problem?! Nanao: Your magic has been erased too. Shuuji: ...Huh? You mean... Nanao: Your magic overflowed as well, allowing you to interfere with Togakushi-san's heart, correct? And your magic power was weak to begin with. Nanao: A large excess of magic flowed into you. Your power was temporarily enhanced but rendered you unable to control it, which resulted in your magic being completely erased. Shuuji: Then, that means... Nanao: You no longer have the power to sense people's emotions. Shuuji: Really...? Nanao: ...... Nanao: I know you said that you don't think you can socialize well without your power, but try not to be so anxious, okay? Shuuji: Honestly... I don't really know how what's going to happen from here out. Shuuji: Life might get more difficult for me, but I'll cross that bridge when I come to it. Shuuji: This is a fresh start for me. I'm just going to focus on being with Touko-san. Nanao: ...I see. Hehe. Nanao: This has been a good experience for me too. I've always been focused on learning more about humans and becoming one. Nanao: It seems there are things far more important than knowledge if you are to live as a human, however. There's a lot more left for me to research. Shuuji: I've learned some new things too. Shuuji: The reason my mom wanted her magic so badly was all because of one person. I never would've thought... I'm shocked, to be honest. Nanao: Oh, there's one more thing I should tell you, Hoshina-kun... Shuuji: Yeah? Shuuji: I'm so sorry! Nene: Huh? What? U-Umm... What are you sorry about? Shuuji: Well, you know how I took all that magic from you? Souma-san says it's all been erased from inside me. Shuuji: We think it reacted to my emotions and was used up as my own magic power. I'm so, so sorry! Nene: Ah, that's what you mean. You made me think something bad happened. Shuuji: ...Umm, you're not angry? Nene: Would being angry get me my magic back? Shuuji: Oh, uh, well... Nene: Hehe, I'm sorry. That was a mean question. I was just joking. Nene: I'm not angry. I'm just happy that Togakushi-senpai has woken up again. It's no problem at all. Shuuji: Ayachi-san... Nene: And hey. Take a look at this. Shuuji: Really? Nene: You didn't use them all up, Hoshina-kun. You only used a portion. The rest came back here. Nene: Just because you don't have to worry about Togakushi-senpai anymore, it doesn't mean you have to worry about me. Shuuji: But that still means I used up part of your magic. Nene: That's offset by what I've gained since you started helping out with the club. Actually, the number of fragments I have now is only a little lower than when I first met you. Nene: But please, you don't have to worry about me. A lot has happened, but how about we call it even? Shuuji: ...Sure, let's do that. Shuuji: I'm going to keep working at the OC though, even if I don't have anything to make up to you. Nene: Of course. You're more than welcome to. Meguru: Of course there is. We were so worried about you! You were gone for days. Touko: ...Sorry for worrying you so much. Touko: Oh, and thank you for the shawl. It's so cute. I just love it. Meguru: I'm glad you like it, but it's a present from everyone. Tsumugi: But you were the one who decided we should buy her a shawl and picked it out, Meguru-chan. Touko: You have such good taste, Inaba-san. Meguru: Y-You think? Ehehe... Meguru: Hey, today's not about me! We're here to celebrate Togakushi-senpai's return. Nene: That's right. Nene: Speaking of which, I brought some cake. Touko: You did? Shuuji: It came from a great shop that Inaba-san told us about. Meguru: Well, originally a friend from my class told me about it. It's all the rage. Nene: So we asked Hisashima-sensei to let us keep it cool in the staff fridge. Touko: I'm not sure this is something students are allowed to do... But I suppose it's fine for today! Meguru: Yeah! Tsumugi: This is a celebration, after all. Nene: Togakushi-senpai, what's your favorite kind of cake? Touko: I wonder... What do you have? Wow, these all look great! Hmm, I don't know which to go for... Shuuji: ...... Meguru, Tsumugi: ...... Touko: Huh? What is it? Oh, did someone call dibs on the gateau chocolat? Meguru: No, that's not the problem. Tsumugi: Togakushi-senpai, you seem kinda... cheerful? Not that you were gloomy before, but... Meguru: You're more excitable than usual. Not that that's a bad thing. It's super cool that you're happy. Nene: Hoshina-kun, what kind would you like? Shuuji: Oh, I'm good with whatever. You guys pick first. Meguru: Well then... Can I take the shortcake? Tsumugi: Yeah, that's fine. I'll go for... the cheesecake. Nene: I'll have the fruit tart. Touko: That leaves you with the mille-feuille, Shuu-kun. Here. Shuuji: Thank you very much. Shuuji: One more time then. Touko-san... Nene, Tsumugi, Meguru, Shuuji: Congratulations on your recovery! Touko: Yeah! Thanks, everyone. I'm glad to be back. Shuuji: Thanks, Inaba-san. Meguru: Let me guess... You guys spent all day today sucking face to make up for all that lost time? Touko: I-I can't answer that! Touko: ...... Nene, Tsumugi, Meguru: ...... Meguru: I don't know what to say... I didn't expect you to take that seriously. Tsumugi: I thought you'd just smile and go, \"mufufu, that's a secret.\" Nene: Didn't I tell them to refrain from doing that at school? Meguru: Now, now. They're two young lovebirds who've finally reunited. Who are we to stop them? Ehehe... Shuuji: Inaba-san, a girl shouldn't laugh like that. You sound like a dirty old man. Meguru: How dare you! I'm an innocent young maiden! Shuuji: If you're as innocent as you claim, then act like it! Tsumugi: But... You know, you've changed a bit, Togakushi-senpai. Touko: Yeah, I was thinking that I feel a bit different... I've been feeling more restless than usual. Tsumugi: Is that a bad thing? Touko: No. I feel restless, but... it's not all that bad. It makes being with you all even more fun. A-And... Touko: It means I love Shuu-kun even more than before. It's such a happy feeling. Shuuji: ...I'm really happy too. Touko: ...... Shuuji: ...... Touko, Shuuji: Hehehe.\nAhaha. Meguru: ...The cake was more than sweet enough, you two. Tsumugi: Hey now, we should be happy for them. Nene: Just please don't start kissing here. I'll get angry if you do. Shuuji: You really think I'd have the courage to do that here? Nene: Well, that's good then. Meguru: I'm sure that they'll be slobbering all over each other the moment we leave them alone. Shuuji: No we won't! Touko: Y-Yeah. There's no way we could kiss in front of other people. Sheesh. Meguru: That didn't seem to be a problem for you before... Tsumugi: Anyway, come on. Let's eat all this cake before someone comes in to talk to us. Nene: You're right. We should eat up before someone walks in on us... But let's try to savor it. Touko: ...? What is it? Shuuji: Oh, nothing really. Anyway, Touko-san. Touko: Hmm? Yeah? Shuuji: I just remembered... I haven't fulfilled my promise. Touko: What promise? Shuuji: You know, the promise to get you a present. You haven't forgotten, have you? Touko: Ah... You did promise that, didn't you? Back in the clubroom the day I collapsed. You said you'd buy me clothes to commemorate us going out. Shuuji: See? You do remember. Think we can do that over the weekend? Touko: Huh? O-Over the weekend? As in, this upcoming one? Shuuji: Is that a problem? Touko: It's not that I don't want to, but, um... I have a lot to do in preparation. The timing just isn't good, so... Shuuji: Well if you have stuff to do... I guess we'll just have to go another time. Touko: Geez. I told you not to give me those puppy-dog eyes. Touko: Anyway, I want to go on a date with you too, so... Shuuji: Is that a yes? Touko: Y-Yeah... Fine. I'll just have to go about this another way. I've got some studying to do! Shuuji: ...Studying?

I might've said too much. Shuuji: It's fine. I had a pretty good idea that she was, anyway. Tsumugi: Yeah... I guess you would. Tsumugi: If you know about Ayachi-san, then it's pretty obvious what Akagi is. Shuuji: But you still feel like you can't say it? Tsumugi: Sorry. Do you think you could give me a bit more time? Tsumugi: It'd be horrible if she got angry with me. Could you let me try and convince her to introduce herself? Shuuji: Yeah, that's cool. I don't want to force it out of you. Tsumugi: Thanks, but also, sorry. Tsumugi: You've helped me out so much, but here I am, keeping secrets. Shuuji: You can't help it. These instructions come from Akagi. Shuuji: That's not gonna stop me from helping you out more, either. Tsumugi: Awesome! I plan on going to the Schwarze Katze after school today. "

It's pretty intense stuff. But don't worry, we try to handle everything with a level head (usually). *chuckles*\n\nI'm Tsumugi Shiiba, one of the club members, by the way!

I'm sure I'll stand out again. The thought is kind of depressing. Nene: Oh, I see... And we take P.E. with another class. The girls from there might get curious.

I was about to leave for the locker room. Shuuji: I have a favor to ask regarding P.E. Wakana: What kind of favor could you be asking, considering we have P.E. separate? You better not be asking for anything dirty! Hideaki: Oh, let me in on the fun. Shuuji: Sorry, but this is serious. It's about Shiiba-san. Wakana: Huh? What about her? Shuuji: Well, she just transfered in, and the way she dresses is unusual. Shuuji: So I'm wondering if I could ask you to lend her a hand if anything happens. Hideaki: Interesting... I didn't think you'd be that concerned about her. Wakana: Could it be... love at first sight? You have a crush on her, don'tcha? Shuuji: No, this is a club matter. Hisashima-sensei asked us to look after her due to her special circumstances. Wakana: Kanae-chan? She asked the OC? Hideaki: Now that you mention it, Ayachi-san did just approach her. I thought it was odd... I guess this explains it. Shuuji: Ayachi-san is also watching out for her, but I thought it could be hard for her to do on her own. Shuuji: But I can't exactly help her during P.E... Sorry, but could you help us out here? Wakana: Will you treat me to something? Shuuji: ...How about a slice of cake sometime? Wakana: Make it two slices. Shuuji: Deal. Thanks. I'm counting on you. Wakana: Yeah. Though, I doubt I'll have much to do since Ayachi-san is already watching out for her. Shuuji: Yeah, okay. Hideaki: I have to say, though, you're taking your club pretty seriously. Shuuji: Yeah, I guess. May as well go all out with it since I went through the trouble of joining. Hideaki: That's a good mindset. Though, I guess just like you. Hideaki: Oh, right. Since you're such a good student, I bet you did your math homework, right? Can you let me copy it later? Shuuji: You should really do it yourself. Hideaki: I know. I will next time. Please. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Don't copy it word-for-word, okay? Hideaki: Gotcha! Thanks, man! Shuuji: Huh? Uh-oh... Hideaki: What's wrong? Shuuji: My math notebook's gone... I haven't seen it all morning, actually. I definitely did my homework, though. Hideaki: Maybe you forgot it at home? Shuuji: No, I didn't even take it out at home... Oh, right! I did my homework in the clubroom. That's gotta be where the notebook is. "

            "Akagi: That means this is two on one! We'll definitely win! Akagi: Go, Tsumugi! Shall we attack at the same time? What's wrong, Tsumugi! Tsumugi?! Tsumugi: *sigh* Fine. I guess I have no choice. Shuuji: Shiiba-san, you're not...? Akagi: Gah?! Tsumugi: I really don't know what else I can say. Nene: Don't worry, I never believed that you would attack me to begin with. Tsumugi: Thank you. But I still ended up stealing the fragments that were meant for you. Nene: Now that they're in your bottle, there's nothing we can do about that. Nene: I know you didn't mean to. Tsumugi: I'm still sorry! I'm going to give Akagi a good talking to, so could you apologize to Souma-san for me? Nene: I'm sure she won't mind at all either. Tsumugi: Yeah, I hope so... Sorry to you too, Hoshina-kun. Tsumugi: I'm sure the raven that was chasing you around all day was Akagi. Shuuji: I agree with Ayachi-san. It's not your fault. Tsumugi: Yeah, but like... Akagi's my responsibility. Tsumugi: Thanks. Nene: Please, go after them. I'll look after Kariya-san. Boy: They have a girl's face, but are dressed like a boy! Boy: C'mon, which is it? Mom, which is it? Mother: I'm sorry. Tsumugi: It's okay. Ahaha... *sigh* Tsumugi: Hoshina-kun? Aww... Did you see that? Shuuji: Hm? S-See what? Tsumugi: Huh? No, it's fine. Really. Shuuji: No, I insist. You're a girl, after all. Tsumugi: ...You did see that, didn't you? Shuuji: Ugh... Tsumugi: But, the way you always treat me like a girl d-does make me happy, I guess. Shuuji: Phew, I thought you were gonna call me a playboy again or something. Tsumugi: Hehe, are you finally acknowledging it? Shuuji: Oh, come on. I'd actually need to be popular first. Shuuji: Oh... I was probably worrying over nothing, but... Shuuji: I thought that you might find it hard to come to the OC tomorrow. Tsumugi: Huh? Shuuji: 'Cause you seem the most worried about what Akagi did out of all of us. Tsumugi: She just comes to these conclusions from her more animalistic instincts. Tsumugi: So sometimes she gets the wrong idea and goes a bit crazy... But she's not a bad girl. Tsumugi: Yeah. She may look human, but alps really are different from us. Tsumugi: I was really shocked by how mature Souma-san looks. Shuuji: I had the advantage of meeting her first. Shuuji: H-Hey, Shiiba-san, you're not― Tsumugi: Don't worry, I'll still come to school and to the OC. Tsumugi: I can tell I'm going to worry you half to death if I don't. Shuuji: Geez, don't scare me like that. Tsumugi: But... I do have to give Akagi a stern talking to as well. Tsumugi: Yeah, of course. Where's this coming from? Shuuji: I was just thinking about how much you care for Akagi. Tsumugi: That's not just because she's going to grant my wish, you know? Shuuji: Yeah, I know. Shuuji: I gotta admit, I'm curious to know what kind of wish you want granted badly enough to go through this. Tsumugi: Hmmm... Tsumugi: It's not that I don't trust you, Hoshina-kun. Tsumugi: But if I tell you, you're definitely gonna laugh at me. So I don't wanna. Shuuji: What? I won't, I swear! Tsumugi: You liar. You're always saying that and then making fun of me anyway. Shuuji: No, I... I do actually, don't I? Shuuji: But it's a wish you want badly enough to make yourself dress up as a guy, right? Tsumugi: Really? Do you know how much trouble it is for me to only be able to dress up in boys' clothes? Tsumugi: I don't think you do, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Hmm, I think you look pretty good, anyway. Tsumugi: That's not the issue here. Tsumugi: Would you like it if you suddenly had to go to school in a girls' uniform? Shuuji: I'd rather die! Shuuji: But that's just how horrible it would be! Shuuji: I get your point, though. The way everyone would go on about how cute I look in girls' clothes would make me wanna die. Tsumugi: I don't want to die, but you understand now, right? Shuuji: Yeah. I'm sorry about everything before. Tsumugi: I never thought you'd show so much remorse, though. Shuuji: Look, I know this doesn't make up for it, but I'll tell you my secret. Tsumugi: Oh yeah, you were trying to explain that. Shuuji: The thing is, Akagi isn't the first one to mistake me for a witch. Shuuji: Apparently, Ayachi-san thought the same thing at first. Tsumugi: She did? Shuuji: Nah, that would be telepathy. Shuuji: My ability's closer to empathy. Tsumugi: ...You're surprisingly untactful, given that ability. Shuuji: Hmm, well speaking from experience, being able to read the mood and knowing how to behave are different things. Shuuji: To be honest with you, that previously made me want to distance myself from other people as much as possible. Tsumugi: ...Huh? Shuuji: I was pretty good at making it at least look like everything was fine. Shuuji: Though, I guess people told me I had eyes like a dead fish pretty often. Tsumugi: Really? You've never seemed like that to me. Shuuji: Yeah. I changed after joining the OC. Shuuji: I was taking life more seriously by the time I met you. Shuuji: So the reason I come across as such a moron is that I'm not really used to interacting with people. Tsumugi: You've been suffering this whole time without telling anyone about it? Shuuji: Don't you find it creepy? I've been reading your emotions this whole time. Tsumugi: It's not like you ever did anything bad with that power, and I am a witch and all. Tsumugi: So if anything, I've probably been the one lacking tact here... No, I know I have. Tsumugi: The wish that made me become a witch. Shuuji: You sure? Tsumugi: It's really not that big of a deal. It's sorta embarrassing how much I've been hiding it, actually. Tsumugi: But, if possible, could you not laugh? Shuuji: I won't. Tsumugi: I used to be really obsessed with dressing up cute and girly. Tsumugi: There was... this one set of clothes I really wanted. Shuuji: ...You didn't wish for money to buy clothes or something, did you? Tsumugi: No, I got a part time job. Shuuji: ...You what. Tsumugi: And so I made my wish... To have one more set of those clothes back on store shelves. Shuuji: So, uh... That's why you have to dress up as a guy? Shuuji: This is far too cruel! Tsumugi: I-I know! I suppose that normally it would have been a smaller cost. Tsumugi: But typically your wish isn't granted until you've collected all the heart fragments. Tsumugi: But I was so, so, so desperate back then. Tsumugi: That Akagi loaned me her magic in advance. Shuuji: Wait, does that mean... Shuuji: You already have those clothes, and the high price is just the interest on that loan? Tsumugi: Y-Y-Yeah, more or less. Shuuji: ...... Tsumugi: ...... Shuuji: ............ Tsumugi: ............ Shuuji: ...Pfft! Shuuji: Ahaha, ahahahaha! What the hell? Ahahahahahahaha! Tsumugi: Hey! You ARE laughing! Shuuji: I-I mean, I never thought... it would be something so pointless. Ahahahaha! Shuuji: Like, she loaned you her magic, and the interest on that loan is forcing you to dress as a guy? Shuuji: That means you haven't even been able to wear them yet, right? Tsumugi: W-Well yeah, but... Geez! Sheesh! You said you wouldn't laugh! "
