            "Kousei: Morning, everyone. Suzune: Hey. Kanna: Good morning, Takamine-san. Kousei: How are the Yule Logs coming along? Suzune: We're about 80\\% done, I think. Kousei: Is there anything I can help with? Suzune: Wanna start prepping the cheesecakes for me? You remember how to do it, don't you? Kousei: Yeah. Kanna: I'll help out as well. Just tell me what to do. Kousei: Aren't you helping with the Yule Logs, though? Kanna: We've already finished rolling them into log-shapes. All that's left is to add the external decorations, but only Suzune-san is skilled enough to do that. Suzune: I'll be fine. You can go ahead and help him. Kousei: Alright. Mei: Whoa! An actual Yule Log! It looks absolutely scrumptious! Nozomi: Are you finished making them? Suzune: For today, at least. Phew... My shoulders are killing me. Kanna: I'm not surprised. You had to put the finishing touches on all of them. Natsume: Well, they certainly turned out great. Thanks for all your hard work. Kousei: We're not very busy right now, so feel free to take a break if you want, Suzune-san. Suzune: Thanks. I'll take you up on that then. Kanna: Of course. Natsume: Now then, let's get these cakes boxed up. Nozomi & Mei: Okaaay! Mei: Welcome to Cafe Stella! Party of two? If you'd rather not wait, we do have a couple counter seats available right now. Would that be alright? Nozomi: Welcome to Cafe Stella! Ah, you placed an order for two Yule Logs under the name Ota? I'll have them ready for you in just a moment. Natsume: Two pancakes, a blend coffee, and a Guatemalan coffee? I'll have those right out to you. Natsume: Two coffees; house blend and Guatemalan, please. Mikado: Coming right up. Kanna: Oh, Natsume-san! I need to go fetch some more Yule Logs from the kitchen. Can you cover for me while I'm gone? Natsume: I'll go fetch them instead. I need to put in another order anyway. Kanna: Alright, that'd be great. Thank you. Kanna: I apologize for the delay, sir. We'll have them ready in just a minute, so please be patient. Natsume: Order coming in. Two plates of pancakes, please. Kousei: Got it. Suzune: How are the Yule Logs selling? Natsume: Fairly well. Most of the customers who've placed advance orders have arrived to pick them up too. Suzune: Phew. That's a relief... Kousei: Were you that worried? Suzune: Well, yeah. I don't know if they're pranks or what, but sometimes you'll get large orders and then the customer never comes to pick it up. Kousei: That kind of stuff actually happens? I've read stories online, but it's scary how easy it is for a single person to screw you over. Suzune: Fortunately, it doesn't look like that's the case this time. Suzune: Anyway, back to work. Pancakes, was it? Kousei: Yeah. I'll handle them. Suzune: You will? Well, okay. Natsume: I'd better get these Yule Logs delivered too. Suzune: I'll help you carry them. I want to see how our customers are doing anyway. Mei: Welcome to Cafe Stella! Miyama: Hello again. Mei: Oh? You're Yuina-chan's--ah, I beg your pardon. Hello there, Mister Miyama. Miyama: Oh, you don't need to be so formal. Miyama: Actually, I'm also here to pick up a cake that I ordered. Mei: A Yule Log, yes? Wait right here; I'll have it out to you in one moment. Suzune: Welcome. Miyama: Hello again. I just can't ignore your cakes, they're so good. Miyama: My daughter's been looking forward to this for a while too. She says no other cake shop will do. Suzune: I'm flattered. I sincerely hope it's to your liking. Miyama: Oh, no need to worry about that. I'm confident it will be every bit as delicious as all the others I've had before. I'm looking forward to it as well. Suzune: Thank you very much. Your praise means a lot to me. Miyama: Oh, and before I forget. Could I also get some shortcakes, fruit tarts... this cheesecake here... and some mousse cakes, as well? Miyama: Four of each. I'm planning to give them to a few acquaintances as gifts. I'd like more people to see how delicious your cakes are. Especially since it's Christmas Eve, you know. Suzune: Would you like us to include some sort of message? It wouldn't take much time to add a simple plaque to it. Miyama: Oh, no. They're just going to be small gifts for some of my coworkers. I have to get back there once I'm done here. Suzune: It seems like you'll have quite a lot to carry, though... Miyama: Maybe, but I'll manage somehow. The hospital is only a few minutes' walk from here. Suzune: Alright. Mei: Here you are, Mister Miyama. Suzune: Ah, Mei-san. He'd also like shortcakes, fruit tarts, cheesecakes, and champagne mousses. Four of each. Mei: O-Oh, sure! I'll add those to your order. Mei: Let's see... In that case, your total comes to 11,820 yen. Miyama: Alright. One second... Wait, where's my wallet? What? Miyama: Ahh, right. I put it in my bag earlier. Phew. There it is. Miyama: My apologies. Mei: No problem, sir. Now then, you paid with 12,000 yen, so your change comes to 180 yen. Here you are. Miyama: Thank you very much. Suzune: Since you've got quite a few cakes, we separated them into two boxes for you. Miyama: Thank you. Suzune: Thank you for coming, and have a good day. Mei: Come visit us again sometime! Mei: Is he going to be okay with all those cakes? He's not going to get sick, is he? Suzune: They're not all for him. He said he's giving them as gifts to some of his coworkers. Mei: Oh, that makes sense. I guess there's nothing to worry about then. Mei: Ah--welcome to Cafe Stella! Suzune: You know, honestly, it's a lot easier making cakes than dealing with customers. Kousei: How are things looking out there? Suzune: Excellent. Everyone seems as happy as a clam. Suzune: But more importantly, why don't you take a break soon? Things are starting to wind down now. Kousei: Alright. Just let me finish up with this and I will. Kousei: Phew... Mikado: Understood. In that case, we will hold on to it for the meantime. Kousei: Yeah. Mikado: Yes... Yes... Kousei: Is there some kind of problem? Nozomi: Apparently one of our customers forgot something at the cafe, so they called to make sure it's still here. Nozomi: Yeah. They left in a rush so they wouldn't be holding up any other customers. You know how busy the cafe is today, with everyone coming in to pick up their cakes. Mikado: I understand. We'll be waiting. Goodbye. Nozomi: Are they coming back to get it? Mikado: Yes. However, he says that he is rather busy at work at the moment, so he does not know when that will be. Kousei: Then should we keep the bag in the fridge in the meantime? Mikado: No need. I am told it merely contains a Christmas present for his daughter. Kousei: Oh. But if so, he'll need to come get it by tonight. Kousei: As a parent, he's got to be feeling pretty anxious. Nozomi: Probably, yeah. Mikado: Hmm. Would you be willing to deliver it to him for us, Takamine Kousei? Nozomi: Oh, you're right! We can just bring it to him instead! Kousei: I guess I don't mind. Does he live around here? Mikado: You remember the little girl named Miyama Yuina who came to order a cake for her father's birthday, don't you? Mikado: The customer who forgot this present is her father. Kousei: Ahh. So that means I'll be going to the Miwa General Hospital? Mikado: Indeed. It might ruin the surprise for little Yuina if you were to deliver to their house instead. Nozomi: That's probably why her dad wanted to come pick it up himself. Mikado: Yes. Kousei: But that's enough reminiscing. I have a job to do. Kousei: No, I'm looking for a Dr. Miyama. I'm here to return something he forgot. Female Nurse: Ahh. Yes, I've been told. Female Nurse: Please give me a moment. He said he'd like to thank you in person. Female Nurse: He says he'll be with you in a minute. Would you mind waiting? It won't be long. Kousei: Sure. Kousei: Huh? Oh, I'm sorry. I was spacing out a little. Miyama: That's quite alright. I'm the one who should be apologizing. Some father I am, forgetting my own daughter's Christmas present. Miyama: Thank you for returning it to me. I truly appreciate it. Kousei: It was no big deal. Kousei: Can I ask you a question, though? These drawings--they haven't always been here, have they? Miyama: Oh, have they not? They were here when I first started working here. ???: Oh? Dr. Miyama? What are you doing out here? "

Mei: Hehe. I'll be sure to let my grandma know. Have as many as you want! Suzune: Hey, Kousei! Is it ready yet? I'm already getting full from all these kelp rolls! Kousei: Sorry for the wait. I just finished now. Mei: But you added some kind of smoked ingredient, didn't you? Kousei: You'll see. Go ahead and try it. Suzune: Uh-huh. Mei: ...... Suzune: ...... Mei: Oh? Suzune: Something tastes different. It's a lot more fragrant when I bite into it. Mei: It can't be the bacon, right? Where's this smoky flavor coming from? Suzune: It doesn't seem to be the vegetables, either... What exactly did you do? Kousei: It's the black pepper. That's what I smoked. Mei: Ohh! It's the seasoning! Kousei: Yeah. In a way, black pepper is actually the main ingredient in carbonara. That's where the name of the dish comes from, in fact. Suzune: It's derived from the Italian word for charcoal burner, right? Because there's supposed to be so much pepper on it that it turns black. Kousei: Exactly. I was contemplating whether or not to smoke the salt, but I thought that would change the flavor too much. Kousei: So I decided to smoke the pepper instead. This way it adds a nice kick without destroying the balance of the dish. Suzune: You're right. It really does add a nice kick. It's amazing how a small addition can make such a big difference. Suzune: Even though the seasoning is fundamentally the same, the flavor has a lot more depth. Mei: This is amazing! Just like authentic carbonara! Not that I know what authentic carbonara tastes like, but still! Kousei: Glad you like it. I only just finished smoking the pepper, so the smell might be a little harsh-- Kousei: But as long as I let it sit for a while, it should disappear. Then all I need to do is mix it with some regular black pepper to fine tune the flavor. Suzune: Sounds good. It could use a bit of adjusting, but I definitely think this is good enough to serve to our customers. In all honesty, this really is delicious. Kousei: Thanks. What about you-- Mei: Phew! That was good! Kousei: Wow. Not even a crumb left. Mei: It was too good! Just like real Italian cuisine! Not that I know what real Italian cuisine tastes like, but still! Suzune: You already said that earlier. I get what you're trying to say, though. Kousei: Ahaha... I wasn't expecting this much of a reaction. I'm flattered. Mei: Seriously, it was delicious! You're a genius, Senpai! Kousei: O-Oh stop it... Suzune: Well, since Mei-san is showering you in praise, I'm going to be a little more critical. Suzune: Like you said before, the dish still needs some balancing. Kousei: I know. It's got a pretty strong flavor, so I'm gonna try letting it mellow overnight next time. Suzune: Instead of trying to figure out everything on your own, though, you should ask the others at the cafe to taste-test your dish first. Suzune: Then you can decide if you want to tone it down, or if you actually want to emphasize that distinct flavor. Mei: Ohh, I see! The more unique it tastes, the more likely it is to grab people's interest! Suzune: Exactly. But you might get differing opinions on which one is better, which'll make it harder to decide. Suzune: Still, it's up to you. At the very least, I don't think anyone's going to object to you adding this dish to our menu. Kousei: Alright. I'll give it a shot. Kousei: And thanks, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Huh? Kousei: I wouldn't have come up with this idea without you, so thanks. Mei: Please! All I did was suggest the first thing that came to mind. Mei: Don't underestimate your own genius, Senpai! This really is amazing! Kousei: Th-Thanks. Suzune: Ahem. Kousei: Wh-What? Suzune: We're all out of cheese and sausages, so I'm gonna need you to make me some more. Kousei: You already ate them all? I wanted some too, you know. Suzune: Oh, stop griping. C'mon! Kousei: Alright, alright. Fine. Mei: Senpai! I want to try smoking some other things too! Kousei: Sure. I'll rummage around my fridge and see what else we can toss in the smoker. Mei: This is gonna be great! Kanna: Here's to another great year! Let's all do our best! Suzune: Alrighty. Ready to get back to work? Kousei: Yes, ma'am. Kousei: Not so much changed as added a new twist. I tried smoking the pepper first. Natsume: I can't say it looks or smells particularly different, though... Kousei: You'll see once you try it. Nozomi: Well, I'm gonna go ahead and dig in! Nozomi: That faint hint of smokiness... It's amazing how much difference it makes. Natsume: You said you smoked it yourself? Kousei: Yep. It was all Hiuchidani-san's idea. Mei: Don't be silly. You came up with the idea to smoke the black pepper. Mei: All I did was suggest that we try to make our own bacon. Natsume: Ah. So you spent the break thinking up ways to improve our menu... Natsume: That's very commendable of you. I'm impressed. Kousei: Thanks. How do you think it tastes? Kanna: I, for one, think it's delicious. It gives the dish a lot more added depth. Nozomi: I think so too. This seems like it'd be a real crowd-pleaser. Natsume: It certainly is delicious, but... Kousei: But? Natsume: I feel like the pepper's unique smokiness has a sort of... mature taste to it. Natsume: It's definitely not bad by any means, but--and this is just my personal opinion... Natsume: But I think I actually prefer the regular carbonara. Natsume: So while I'm all for adding this to our menu, I don't think it should replace the original version. Nozomi: You said you added the smoked black pepper to the pasta at the end, right? Kousei: Yeah, I did. Nozomi: In that case, why don't we just serve our regular carbonara with a shaker of smoked black pepper on the side? Nozomi: That way, customers can add as much or as little as they want. Natsume: How would we know how much to prepare in advance, though? Some customers might use a lot more than others. Suzune: A lot of beef bowl restaurants used to do the same thing with their special shichimi spices, but they had to stop the practice a little while back. Suzune: Some customers were using unbelievable amounts of spice, which ended up hurting their profits. Nozomi: Oh... I guess that won't work then. Kanna: It seems like our safest option would be to add this smoked pepper version as a separate item on the menu. Kousei: Alright. So I have all the judges' approval? Kanna: Absolutely. I think this would make a fine addition to our menu. Nozomi: Me too. Natsume: Me three. Kanna: What do you think, Mikado-san? Mikado: I believe Natsume mentioned earlier that this dish had a rather mature taste. However, many of our customers also come here specifically for our coffee and tea. Mikado: Judging from what I have gathered, this would suit their preferences well. Mikado: Therefore, I am in agreement. Kousei: Thank goodness... Mei: Way to go, Senpai! Kousei: Thanks! Kousei: I was just gonna do it at home, actually... Mikado: Among other problems, that would be quite expensive. I would not recommend you do that. Kousei: I guess that's true. Mikado: I do have some other ideas you may wish to consider. Are you free to talk after this? Kousei: Sure. I've got time. Kanna: In that case, let's call it a day here. See you tomorrow, everyone. Natsume: See you tomorrow. Nozomi: See you tomorrow! Kousei: Phew... Kousei: Huh? Hiuchidani-san? Mei: Hey. Kousei: What are you still doing here? Mei: I was waiting for you to finish. Kousei: You could've waited inside. Mei: Ahaha. I didn't want to bother you guys. Mei: Anyway, I know I should've said something earlier... but would you mind walking me home? Kousei: Sure. I don't mind. Let's go. Mei: Thanks! Mei: Congratulations on getting your new recipe approved, by the way. Kousei: Well, you helped with that. Mei: Not at all. You did this on your own, Senpai. Kousei: Nah, it's all thanks to you. I would've never come up with this idea on my own. Kousei: Seriously, thank you. I'm really grateful. Kousei: This might sound kind of melodramatic... but I think I've gained a little more confidence in myself now. Mei: Ehehe... You're gonna make me blush. I don't mean to sound melodramatic either, but, like... Mei: You've done a lot for me as well, Senpai. Ever since you've helped me open up about my left eye, I feel like a huge weight's been lifted off my shoulders. Mei: That's why I wanted to be able to return the favor if I could. Mei: I'm glad I managed to be of some small help to you. Kousei: It wasn't small at all. You were a big help. Kousei: I was hoping to do something like this before I had to deal with my exams, so I'm glad it all went so well. Mei: Oh, your exams are coming up? Kousei: At the end of the month, yeah. Mei: Does that mean you're gonna be working fewer hours? Kousei: No, I'll be working the same as usual. I'll do fine as long as I pay attention in class. Kousei: And I can always study after work too. Mei: You're a pretty diligent student, aren't you? Kousei: I don't know about that... I'm just the sort of guy who hates procrastinating. Mei: That's what it means to be diligent, Senpai. I think that's something to be proud of. Kousei: Nah, trust me... I can be pretty lazy when I want. Mei: But in front of me, at least, you're always hardworking and dependable. Kousei: Okay, sheesh. Stop flattering me. It's gonna go to my head. Mei: Ahaha! Alright. Mei: Well, good night, Senpai. Kousei: Good night. And sorry you had to wait for me earlier. Mei: That's okay. I waited because I wanted to congratulate you. Mei: Anyway, see you tomorrow! Kousei: Yeah. See you tomorrow. Mei: ...... Mei: Hmm... Exams... "

Looks like I'm all out of beer. Mei: Would you like some tea? I haven't drunk directly out of this one yet. Suzune: Sure. By the way, these kelp rolls are delicious. Mei: Hehe. I'll be sure to let my grandma know. Have as many as you want! Suzune: Hey, Kousei! Is it ready yet? I'm already getting full from all these kelp rolls! Kousei: Sorry for the wait. I just finished now. Mei: But you added some kind of smoked ingredient, didn't you? Kousei: You'll see. Go ahead and try it. Suzune: Uh-huh. Mei: ...... Suzune: ...... Mei: Oh? Suzune: Something tastes different. It's a lot more fragrant when I bite into it. Mei: It can't be the bacon, right? Where's this smoky flavor coming from? Suzune: It doesn't seem to be the vegetables, either... What exactly did you do? Kousei: It's the black pepper. That's what I smoked. Mei: Ohh! It's the seasoning! Kousei: Yeah. In a way, black pepper is actually the main ingredient in carbonara. That's where the name of the dish comes from, in fact. Suzune: It's derived from the Italian word for charcoal burner, right? Because there's supposed to be so much pepper on it that it turns black. Kousei: Exactly. I was contemplating whether or not to smoke the salt, but I thought that would change the flavor too much. Kousei: So I decided to smoke the pepper instead. This way it adds a nice kick without destroying the balance of the dish. Suzune: You're right. It really does add a nice kick. It's amazing how a small addition can make such a big difference. Suzune: Even though the seasoning is fundamentally the same, the flavor has a lot more depth. Mei: This is amazing! Just like authentic carbonara! Not that I know what authentic carbonara tastes like, but still! Kousei: Glad you like it. I only just finished smoking the pepper, so the smell might be a little harsh-- Kousei: But as long as I let it sit for a while, it should disappear. Then all I need to do is mix it with some regular black pepper to fine tune the flavor. Suzune: Sounds good. It could use a bit of adjusting, but I definitely think this is good enough to serve to our customers. In all honesty, this really is delicious. Kousei: Thanks. What about you-- Mei: Phew! That was good! Kousei: Wow. Not even a crumb left. Mei: It was too good! Just like real Italian cuisine! Not that I know what real Italian cuisine tastes like, but still! Suzune: You already said that earlier. I get what you're trying to say, though. Kousei: Ahaha... I wasn't expecting this much of a reaction. I'm flattered. Mei: Seriously, it was delicious! You're a genius, Senpai! Kousei: O-Oh stop it... Suzune: Well, since Mei-san is showering you in praise, I'm going to be a little more critical. Suzune: Like you said before, the dish still needs some balancing. Kousei: I know. It's got a pretty strong flavor, so I'm gonna try letting it mellow overnight next time. Suzune: Instead of trying to figure out everything on your own, though, you should ask the others at the cafe to taste-test your dish first. Suzune: Then you can decide if you want to tone it down, or if you actually want to emphasize that distinct flavor. Mei: Ohh, I see! The more unique it tastes, the more likely it is to grab people's interest! Suzune: Exactly. But you might get differing opinions on which one is better, which'll make it harder to decide. Suzune: Still, it's up to you. At the very least, I don't think anyone's going to object to you adding this dish to our menu. Kousei: Alright. I'll give it a shot. Kousei: And thanks, Hiuchidani-san.

Kanna: Let's just wish her a quick Happy New Year so that we don't bother her too long. Kousei: Good idea. Kousei: Oh, I almost forgot. Mikado explained your disappearance to the others by telling them you had to go home because of some family matters. Kousei: So if they ask you about, just give some vague explanation and change the topic. Kanna: Got it. Kousei: Yeah. The sauce and stuff smells amazing. Kousei: The food's a bit expensive, but there's just something too tempting about it to pass up. Kanna: Do you think we should participate next year? Kousei: Hmm... I bet Suzune-san could whip up some kind of crepe or something if we talked to her about it. Kousei: Not that we'd have to wait until next year, though. We could always try participating in the summer festival. Kousei: I'll look into it. Kousei: (I promise we'll be happy. Rest assured.) Kousei: Me? I didn't really wish for anything. Kousei: All I did was thank the gods for reuniting me with you. That's pretty much it. Kanna: You didn't wish for anything about our future together? Kousei: That's not something I need to ask God for. Kousei: Even without his help, I plan on making you happy. Kanna: A-Ahaha... Hearing you say that is kind of embarrassing. Kanna: But... thank you. I really appreciate that. Kanna: And in return, I'll do my best to make you happy as well, Kousei-san. Kousei: Thanks. Kanna: Yes? Ah, Natsume-san! Happy New Year! Natsume: Happy... New Year... Natsume: B-But how are you here?! I thought... Kanna: Well, it's a long story... but essentially, you could say... the power of love prevailed. Natsume: I have no idea what that means, but is everything resolved now? Kanna: Yes, everything's okay. I'm sorry for worrying you. Natsume: Oh... Thank goodness. That's wonderful news. Natsume: It's good to have you back. Kanna: Thank you. It's good to be back! Kousei: By the way, Shiki-san. Have you seen Nozomi anywhere? Natsume: I saw her a little while ago talking to Hiuchidani-san just outside the shrine gates. Kousei: Really? Thanks. We'll see if we can catch her. Mei: Man, that outfit really does look amazing on you. Nozomi: You think so? Ehehe... Nozomi: Do you want to try it on too, Mei-chan? You could even start working right away. Mei: Erm... Nah, I think I'm good. I'd rather just admire you shrine maidens from afar. Nozomi: Don't be like that. C'mon, just try it on for a bit! If you don't try it, you'll never know what it's like. Mei: I get the feeling you're just trying to recruit me. Nozomi: What? Well... Ehehe... Nozomi: But I really do think it'll look good on you! Honest. You'd look super cute! Mei: You think so? I don't even have it on, but you're already making me feel embarrassed... Thanks, though. Kousei: Ah, there they are. Mei: Huh? Ah, Senpai! Nozomi: Kanna-san! You're back? Kanna: Yes. I'm sorry for all the trouble. Kanna: But everything's alright now. I hope we all have another great year together. Nozomi: Me too. Mei: Same here. Kousei: Yeah. Nozomi: Heh. Kousei: What? Nozomi: Hm? Nothing. Just glad to see you're feeling better now. Kousei: ...... Nozomi: You might've thought you were doing a good job of hiding it, but you can't hide anything from me. Nozomi: Don't underestimate the power of a childhood friend. Kousei: Sorry. But yeah, I'm fine now. Nozomi: You'd better not keep worrying me even now that you have a girlfriend, okay? Kousei: I won't. Sorry. Nozomi: Good. Nozomi: Alrighty, I'd better get back to work. I'll see you guys later. Mei: Hang in there, Nozomi-chan. Nozomi: Thanks. I will. Mei: I'd better go pray at the shrine too. I haven't had the chance yet, since I got caught up chatting with Nozomi-chan. Kousei: Oh, okay. Mei: Alright. Bye, you two. I'll see you at the cafe! Kanna: See you then! Kousei: Yeah. See ya. Kanna: *giggle*! Kousei: Hmm? Kanna: I'm so happy that I get to talk to everyone again. Kanna: It's starting to sink in... I really am back. Kousei: What, you were still in disbelief? Kanna: I had my doubts, but they finally disappeared while I was talking to the others. Kousei: Was I not good enough? Kanna: Oh, no! I didn't mean that... I just couldn't help but feel like I was dreaming or having some kind of hallucination last night. Kanna: I mean, I was dying to see you and be with you again. Kousei: That kinda makes it sound like the others don't really matter to you. Kanna: Oh, I didn't mean it like that. I care about Natsume-san, Nozomi-san, Mei-san... Kanna: And Suzune-san as well, even though we didn't get to see her today. Kanna: I've lived for a very long time now, but I've never had anyone care about me the way they do. They're all very important friends to me. Kanna: However, you're more than a friend to me, Kousei-san. Kanna: Yes? Kousei: Why don't we move in together? Kanna: ...... Kanna: Okay. Kousei: Are you sure? Kanna: Well... I do love you. And since I do, we're no doubt going to end up living together one day anyway, so... Kanna: It's embarrassing... but I'm not against the idea. Kanna: ...... Kousei: ...... Kousei: Uhh. Kanna: Yesh?! Kousei: Oh, uh... Sorry. Kousei: This is it, I guess. Kanna: Wh-What?! What are we going to be doing?! Kousei: Huh? No, I didn't mean it like that. Kousei: I just meant, you know... this is the start of our new life living together and all. Kanna: W-Well, yes! That it is! Kanna: Thank you for welcoming me to your home... Kousei: No problem. Kanna: Right... The two of us... are going to be living together. Kousei: Uhh. Kanna: Yesh?! Kousei: We should probably do something besides standing here and chatting. Wanna head inside and--  Kanna: Put the head inside?! You want to go straight to penetration already?! With no foreplay or anything?! Kanna: I've always wanted my first time to be somewhat memorable, or at least have a bit more buildup to it-- Kanna: But if nothing else, I really think you should wait until I'm wet enough, otherwise it's going to be extremely painful! Kousei: I was going to ask if you wanted to head inside and relax... you know, inside my apartment. Kanna: R-Right! Of course. We can't just stand around outside chatting all day, can we? Kousei: ...... Kanna: I'm sorry. I'm just really nervous about a myriad of different things, and... urk... Kousei: That's okay. Don't worry about it. Kanna: You're right. We can't just stand in the doorway all day. Alright... Kanna: Pardon... me... Kousei: ...... Kousei: This is going to be your home from now on too. I think it's important to say it right, just so you can get into the habit of it. Kousei: Do you want to try that again? Kanna: I'm... I'm home. Kousei: Welcome home. Kanna: That was kind of embarrassing. Kousei: Yeah, a little. Kanna: But... I'm sure we'll get used to saying it soon enough. Kousei: Yeah. We're gonna be spending a lot of time together. Kanna: Okay. Now it's your turn, Kousei-san. Kousei: Alright. Kousei: I'm home. Kanna: Welcome home. Both: ...... Both: Pfft. Kousei: Alright. Give me a minute to organize my closet a bit. Kousei: In the meantime, though... what should we eat for lunch? Kanna: I'd be happy to cook. What kind of ingredients do you have? Mind if I took a look? Kousei: You're more than welcome to... but err, there's probably not much you can make. Sorry. All I managed to scrape together yesterday was a plate of omelet rice. Kousei: And unfortunately most supermarkets are closed, since it's New Year's Day... Kanna: There's not much... but you've got onions, eggs, and a bit of chicken left. Oh, and coffee too. Kousei: Feel free to have some, if you want. Kanna: Thank you. Hmm... There's also soy sauce and mirin... Seems like you've got the basic seasonings, at least. Kousei: Nozomi uses them a lot. Kanna: In that case, why don't I make oyakodon? It might be a bit light on the meat, though, since there's not much chicken left. Kousei: That's fine. I wouldn't mind oyakodon. Kanna: There's no parsley, but I guess we can do without it. Oh, but you do have some green onions. Kanna: Also... I'd like to have miso soup and a couple other side dishes as well. Kousei: You should be able to get those things at the convenience store, I'd think. Kanna: Probably. I'm going to head out and pick up a few things then. Kousei: I'll come with you. Kanna: N-No, that's okay. I'm feeling a little worked up right now... so I'd like the chance to calm down a bit. Kousei: Alright. Kanna: But just for the record, it's not because I... *mumble* *mumble*... okay? Kousei: Hmm? Did you say something? Kanna: Ngh! Kanna: A-Anyway, I'll be right back! Kousei: Hmm... Kousei: I guess I should air out the mattress before she gets back. Kousei: You can go ahead and take yours first. Kanna: No, that would just be plain rude. You go first, Kousei-san. Kousei: Nah. Since you have longer hair, it's going to take more time to dry afterwards, right? So... Kanna: I... guess so. Well, alright... I'll go first. Kousei: It's the door on your right. Kanna: Okay. I'll try to finish as quickly as I can. Kousei: You don't have to be in a rush. I wouldn't want you catching a cold or anything. Take your time and get yourself warmed up. Kanna: Okay. Kousei: It's a cheap brand, though, so I'm not sure if it's good for women's hair or not. Kanna: I doubt it'll be a problem. Though my hair is quite long, so I might end up using quite a lot of it. Kanna: So let me apologize in advance. Kousei: That's okay. I don't even know if you'll like it. Kousei: But yeah. This apartment is yours too, starting today.

Kousei: This isn't even that bad, actually. Kanna: Nozomi-san must be running ragged with all these visitors. Kousei: Yeah. She's probably busy working as we speak. Kanna: Let's just wish her a quick Happy New Year so that we don't bother her too long. Kousei: Good idea. Kousei: Oh, I almost forgot. Mikado explained your disappearance to the others by telling them you had to go home because of some family matters. Kousei: So if they ask you about, just give some vague explanation and change the topic. Kanna: Got it. Kousei: Yeah. The sauce and stuff smells amazing. Kousei: The food's a bit expensive, but there's just something too tempting about it to pass up. Kanna: Do you think we should participate next year? Kousei: Hmm... I bet Suzune-san could whip up some kind of crepe or something if we talked to her about it. Kousei: Not that we'd have to wait until next year, though. We could always try participating in the summer festival. Kousei: I'll look into it. Kousei: (I promise we'll be happy. Rest assured.) Kousei: Me? I didn't really wish for anything. Kousei: All I did was thank the gods for reuniting me with you. That's pretty much it. Kanna: You didn't wish for anything about our future together? Kousei: That's not something I need to ask God for. Kousei: Even without his help, I plan on making you happy. Kanna: A-Ahaha... Hearing you say that is kind of embarrassing. Kanna: But... thank you. I really appreciate that. Kanna: And in return, I'll do my best to make you happy as well, Kousei-san. Kousei: Thanks. Kanna: Yes? Ah, Natsume-san! Happy New Year! Natsume: Happy... New Year... Natsume: B-But how are you here?! I thought... Kanna: Well, it's a long story... but essentially, you could say... the power of love prevailed. Natsume: I have no idea what that means, but is everything resolved now? Kanna: Yes, everything's okay. I'm sorry for worrying you. Natsume: Oh... Thank goodness. That's wonderful news. Natsume: It's good to have you back. Kanna: Thank you. It's good to be back! Kousei: By the way, Shiki-san. Have you seen Nozomi anywhere? Natsume: I saw her a little while ago talking to Hiuchidani-san just outside the shrine gates. Kousei: Really? Thanks. We'll see if we can catch her. Mei: Man, that outfit really does look amazing on you. Nozomi: You think so? Ehehe... Nozomi: Do you want to try it on too, Mei-chan? You could even start working right away. Mei: Erm... Nah, I think I'm good. I'd rather just admire you shrine maidens from afar. Nozomi: Don't be like that. C'mon, just try it on for a bit! If you don't try it, you'll never know what it's like. Mei: I get the feeling you're just trying to recruit me. Nozomi: What? Well... Ehehe... Nozomi: But I really do think it'll look good on you! Honest. You'd look super cute! Mei: You think so? I don't even have it on, but you're already making me feel embarrassed... Thanks, though. Kousei: Ah, there they are. Mei: Huh? Ah, Senpai! Nozomi: Kanna-san! You're back? Kanna: Yes. I'm sorry for all the trouble. Kanna: But everything's alright now. I hope we all have another great year together. Nozomi: Me too. Mei: Same here. Kousei: Yeah. Nozomi: Heh. Kousei: What? Nozomi: Hm? Nothing. Just glad to see you're feeling better now. Kousei: ...... Nozomi: You might've thought you were doing a good job of hiding it, but you can't hide anything from me. Nozomi: Don't underestimate the power of a childhood friend. Kousei: Sorry. But yeah, I'm fine now. Nozomi: You'd better not keep worrying me even now that you have a girlfriend, okay? Kousei: I won't. Sorry. Nozomi: Good. Nozomi: Alrighty, I'd better get back to work. I'll see you guys later. Mei: Hang in there, Nozomi-chan. Nozomi: Thanks. I will. Mei: I'd better go pray at the shrine too. I haven't had the chance yet, since I got caught up chatting with Nozomi-chan. Kousei: Oh, okay. Mei: Alright. Bye, you two. I'll see you at the cafe! Kanna: See you then! Kousei: Yeah. See ya. Kanna: *giggle*! Kousei: Hmm? Kanna: I'm so happy that I get to talk to everyone again. Kanna: It's starting to sink in... I really am back. Kousei: What, you were still in disbelief? Kanna: I had my doubts, but they finally disappeared while I was talking to the others. Kousei: Was I not good enough? Kanna: Oh, no! I didn't mean that... I just couldn't help but feel like I was dreaming or having some kind of hallucination last night. Kanna: I mean, I was dying to see you and be with you again. Kousei: That kinda makes it sound like the others don't really matter to you. Kanna: Oh, I didn't mean it like that. I care about Natsume-san, Nozomi-san, Mei-san... Kanna: And Suzune-san as well, even though we didn't get to see her today. Kanna: I've lived for a very long time now, but I've never had anyone care about me the way they do. They're all very important friends to me. Kanna: However, you're more than a friend to me, Kousei-san. Kanna: Yes? Kousei: Why don't we move in together? Kanna: ...... Kanna: Okay. Kousei: Are you sure? Kanna: Well... I do love you. And since I do, we're no doubt going to end up living together one day anyway, so... Kanna: It's embarrassing... but I'm not against the idea. Kanna: ...... Kousei: ...... Kousei: Uhh. Kanna: Yesh?! Kousei: Oh, uh... Sorry. Kousei: This is it, I guess. Kanna: Wh-What?! What are we going to be doing?! Kousei: Huh? No, I didn't mean it like that. Kousei: I just meant, you know... this is the start of our new life living together and all. Kanna: W-Well, yes! That it is! Kanna: Thank you for welcoming me to your home... Kousei: No problem. Kanna: Right... The two of us... are going to be living together. Kousei: Uhh. Kanna: Yesh?! Kousei: We should probably do something besides standing here and chatting. Wanna head inside and--  Kanna: Put the head inside?! You want to go straight to penetration already?! With no foreplay or anything?! Kanna: I've always wanted my first time to be somewhat memorable, or at least have a bit more buildup to it-- Kanna: But if nothing else, I really think you should wait until I'm wet enough, otherwise it's going to be extremely painful! Kousei: I was going to ask if you wanted to head inside and relax... you know, inside my apartment. Kanna: R-Right! Of course. We can't just stand around outside chatting all day, can we? Kousei: ...... Kanna: I'm sorry. I'm just really nervous about a myriad of different things, and... urk... Kousei: That's okay. Don't worry about it. Kanna: You're right. We can't just stand in the doorway all day. Alright... Kanna: Pardon... me... Kousei: ...... Kousei: This is going to be your home from now on too. I think it's important to say it right, just so you can get into the habit of it. Kousei: Do you want to try that again? Kanna: I'm... I'm home. Kousei: Welcome home. Kanna: That was kind of embarrassing. Kousei: Yeah, a little. Kanna: But... I'm sure we'll get used to saying it soon enough. Kousei: Yeah. We're gonna be spending a lot of time together. Kanna: Okay. Now it's your turn, Kousei-san. Kousei: Alright. Kousei: I'm home. Kanna: Welcome home. Both: ...... Both: Pfft. Kousei: Alright. Give me a minute to organize my closet a bit. Kousei: In the meantime, though... what should we eat for lunch? Kanna: I'd be happy to cook. What kind of ingredients do you have? Mind if I took a look? Kousei: You're more than welcome to... but err, there's probably not much you can make. Sorry. All I managed to scrape together yesterday was a plate of omelet rice. Kousei: And unfortunately most supermarkets are closed, since it's New Year's Day... Kanna: There's not much... but you've got onions, eggs, and a bit of chicken left. Oh, and coffee too. Kousei: Feel free to have some, if you want. Kanna: Thank you. Hmm... There's also soy sauce and mirin... Seems like you've got the basic seasonings, at least. Kousei: Nozomi uses them a lot. Kanna: In that case, why don't I make oyakodon? It might be a bit light on the meat, though, since there's not much chicken left. Kousei: That's fine. I wouldn't mind oyakodon. Kanna: There's no parsley, but I guess we can do without it. Oh, but you do have some green onions. Kanna: Also... I'd like to have miso soup and a couple other side dishes as well. Kousei: You should be able to get those things at the convenience store, I'd think. Kanna: Probably. I'm going to head out and pick up a few things then. Kousei: I'll come with you. Kanna: N-No, that's okay. I'm feeling a little worked up right now... so I'd like the chance to calm down a bit. Kousei: Alright. Kanna: But just for the record, it's not because I... *mumble* *mumble*... okay? Kousei: Hmm? Did you say something? Kanna: Ngh! Kanna: A-Anyway, I'll be right back! Kousei: Hmm... Kousei: I guess I should air out the mattress before she gets back. Kousei: You can go ahead and take yours first. Kanna: No, that would just be plain rude. You go first, Kousei-san. Kousei: Nah. Since you have longer hair, it's going to take more time to dry afterwards, right? So... Kanna: I... guess so. Well, alright... I'll go first. Kousei: It's the door on your right. Kanna: Okay.

Kanna: You know, kissing. I had no idea it would make me feel so hot. Even though it's not my first time anymore... it's sho amazing... Mikado: You had me quite confused at first. Well, I am glad that your relationship seems to be going well... Mikado: But how were things? Kanna: It's strange. Even though all we're doing is putting our lips together... it makes my entire body go numb, making it hard to even breathe, plus my head goes completely blank-- Mikado: I was not asking you to describe your impressions of kissing. Kanna: Wait! I know what you're thinking, but we didn't use any tongue! That would virtually be foreplay, and we haven't had sex yet, so-- Mikado: I was not inquiring about any of that, you nymphomanic excuse of a Grim Reaper.

Kanna: At least, I'm sure it would for me. Mikado: But not for him? Kanna: I'm afraid. If I were to be his first, and then disappear soon after... Mikado: ...... Kanna: Oh, that reminds me.

Kanna: That's why the most I could give him was an ordinary kiss. Kanna: Truth be told, it may have been better if we never even did that. Kanna: But I really do love him, so I just couldn't help myself... Mikado: That was a part of it, I'm sure. Mikado: But you allowed him to kiss you because you saw no problem with it, did you not? Kanna: Yes. I hadn't realized it myself, but now that you mention it... you're probably right. Kanna: I'm certain that Kousei-san will be fine. Mikado: If you can say that with such confidence, then you have nothing to worry about.

Do you have to drop by heaven and say hello to God or something? Kanna: No, nothing like that. Kanna: Actually, I was hoping I could spend it with you. What do you say we go on another date tomorrow? Kanna: There's someplace I'd like to go. Kousei: Fine by me. In fact, I'd love to. Kousei: Where are we going? Kanna: That's... a secret for now. Kousei: It's a surprise, huh? Kanna: More or less.

Mei: Hehe. I'll be sure to let my grandma know. Have as many as you want! Suzune: Hey, Kousei! Is it ready yet? I'm already getting full from all these kelp rolls! Kousei: Sorry for the wait. I just finished now. Mei: But you added some kind of smoked ingredient, didn't you? Kousei: You'll see. Go ahead and try it. Suzune: Uh-huh. Mei: ...... Suzune: ...... Mei: Oh? Suzune: Something tastes different. It's a lot more fragrant when I bite into it. Mei: It can't be the bacon, right? Where's this smoky flavor coming from? Suzune: It doesn't seem to be the vegetables, either... What exactly did you do? Kousei: It's the black pepper. That's what I smoked. Mei: Ohh! It's the seasoning! Kousei: Yeah. In a way, black pepper is actually the main ingredient in carbonara. That's where the name of the dish comes from, in fact. Suzune: It's derived from the Italian word for charcoal burner, right? Because there's supposed to be so much pepper on it that it turns black. Kousei: Exactly. I was contemplating whether or not to smoke the salt, but I thought that would change the flavor too much. Kousei: So I decided to smoke the pepper instead. This way it adds a nice kick without destroying the balance of the dish. Suzune: You're right. It really does add a nice kick. It's amazing how a small addition can make such a big difference. Suzune: Even though the seasoning is fundamentally the same, the flavor has a lot more depth. Mei: This is amazing! Just like authentic carbonara! Not that I know what authentic carbonara tastes like, but still! Kousei: Glad you like it. I only just finished smoking the pepper, so the smell might be a little harsh-- Kousei: But as long as I let it sit for a while, it should disappear. Then all I need to do is mix it with some regular black pepper to fine tune the flavor. Suzune: Sounds good. It could use a bit of adjusting, but I definitely think this is good enough to serve to our customers. In all honesty, this really is delicious. Kousei: Thanks. What about you-- Mei: Phew! That was good! Kousei: Wow. Not even a crumb left. Mei: It was too good! Just like real Italian cuisine! Not that I know what real Italian cuisine tastes like, but still! Suzune: You already said that earlier. I get what you're trying to say, though. Kousei: Ahaha... I wasn't expecting this much of a reaction. I'm flattered. Mei: Seriously, it was delicious! You're a genius, Senpai! Kousei: O-Oh stop it... Suzune: Well, since Mei-san is showering you in praise, I'm going to be a little more critical. Suzune: Like you said before, the dish still needs some balancing. Kousei: I know. It's got a pretty strong flavor, so I'm gonna try letting it mellow overnight next time. Suzune: Instead of trying to figure out everything on your own, though, you should ask the others at the cafe to taste-test your dish first. Suzune: Then you can decide if you want to tone it down, or if you actually want to emphasize that distinct flavor. Mei: Ohh, I see! The more unique it tastes, the more likely it is to grab people's interest! Suzune: Exactly. But you might get differing opinions on which one is better, which'll make it harder to decide. Suzune: Still, it's up to you. At the very least, I don't think anyone's going to object to you adding this dish to our menu. Kousei: Alright. I'll give it a shot. Kousei: And thanks, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Huh? Kousei: I wouldn't have come up with this idea without you, so thanks. Mei: Please! All I did was suggest the first thing that came to mind. Mei: Don't underestimate your own genius, Senpai! This really is amazing! Kousei: Th-Thanks. Suzune: Ahem. Kousei: Wh-What? Suzune: We're all out of cheese and sausages, so I'm gonna need you to make me some more. Kousei: You already ate them all? I wanted some too, you know. Suzune: Oh, stop griping. C'mon! Kousei: Alright, alright. Fine. Mei: Senpai! I want to try smoking some other things too! Kousei: Sure. I'll rummage around my fridge and see what else we can toss in the smoker. Mei: This is gonna be great! Kanna: Here's to another great year! Let's all do our best! Suzune: Alrighty. Ready to get back to work? Kousei: Yes, ma'am. Kousei: Not so much changed as added a new twist. I tried smoking the pepper first. Natsume: I can't say it looks or smells particularly different, though... Kousei: You'll see once you try it. Nozomi: Well, I'm gonna go ahead and dig in! Nozomi: That faint hint of smokiness... It's amazing how much difference it makes. Natsume: You said you smoked it yourself? Kousei: Yep. It was all Hiuchidani-san's idea. Mei: Don't be silly. You came up with the idea to smoke the black pepper. Mei: All I did was suggest that we try to make our own bacon. Natsume: Ah. So you spent the break thinking up ways to improve our menu... Natsume: That's very commendable of you. I'm impressed. Kousei: Thanks. How do you think it tastes? Kanna: I, for one, think it's delicious. It gives the dish a lot more added depth. Nozomi: I think so too. This seems like it'd be a real crowd-pleaser. Natsume: It certainly is delicious, but... Kousei: But? Natsume: I feel like the pepper's unique smokiness has a sort of... mature taste to it. Natsume: It's definitely not bad by any means, but--and this is just my personal opinion... Natsume: But I think I actually prefer the regular carbonara. Natsume: So while I'm all for adding this to our menu, I don't think it should replace the original version. Nozomi: You said you added the smoked black pepper to the pasta at the end, right? Kousei: Yeah, I did. Nozomi: In that case, why don't we just serve our regular carbonara with a shaker of smoked black pepper on the side? Nozomi: That way, customers can add as much or as little as they want. Natsume: How would we know how much to prepare in advance, though? Some customers might use a lot more than others. Suzune: A lot of beef bowl restaurants used to do the same thing with their special shichimi spices, but they had to stop the practice a little while back. Suzune: Some customers were using unbelievable amounts of spice, which ended up hurting their profits. Nozomi: Oh... I guess that won't work then. Kanna: It seems like our safest option would be to add this smoked pepper version as a separate item on the menu. Kousei: Alright. So I have all the judges' approval? Kanna: Absolutely. I think this would make a fine addition to our menu. Nozomi: Me too. Natsume: Me three. Kanna: What do you think, Mikado-san? Mikado: I believe Natsume mentioned earlier that this dish had a rather mature taste. However, many of our customers also come here specifically for our coffee and tea. Mikado: Judging from what I have gathered, this would suit their preferences well. Mikado: Therefore, I am in agreement. Kousei: Thank goodness... Mei: Way to go, Senpai! Kousei: Thanks! Kousei: I was just gonna do it at home, actually... Mikado: Among other problems, that would be quite expensive. I would not recommend you do that. Kousei: I guess that's true. Mikado: I do have some other ideas you may wish to consider. Are you free to talk after this? Kousei: Sure. I've got time. Kanna: In that case, let's call it a day here. See you tomorrow, everyone. Natsume: See you tomorrow. Nozomi: See you tomorrow! Kousei: Phew... Kousei: Huh? Hiuchidani-san? Mei: Hey. Kousei: What are you still doing here? Mei: I was waiting for you to finish. Kousei: You could've waited inside. Mei: Ahaha. I didn't want to bother you guys. Mei: Anyway, I know I should've said something earlier... but would you mind walking me home? Kousei: Sure. I don't mind. Let's go. Mei: Thanks! Mei: Congratulations on getting your new recipe approved, by the way. Kousei: Well, you helped with that. Mei: Not at all. You did this on your own, Senpai. Kousei: Nah, it's all thanks to you. I would've never come up with this idea on my own. Kousei: Seriously, thank you. I'm really grateful. Kousei: This might sound kind of melodramatic... but I think I've gained a little more confidence in myself now. Mei: Ehehe... You're gonna make me blush. I don't mean to sound melodramatic either, but, like... Mei: You've done a lot for me as well, Senpai. Ever since you've helped me open up about my left eye, I feel like a huge weight's been lifted off my shoulders. Mei: That's why I wanted to be able to return the favor if I could. Mei: I'm glad I managed to be of some small help to you. Kousei: It wasn't small at all. You were a big help. Kousei: I was hoping to do something like this before I had to deal with my exams, so I'm glad it all went so well. Mei: Oh, your exams are coming up? Kousei: At the end of the month, yeah. Mei: Does that mean you're gonna be working fewer hours? Kousei: No, I'll be working the same as usual. I'll do fine as long as I pay attention in class. Kousei: And I can always study after work too. Mei: You're a pretty diligent student, aren't you? Kousei: I don't know about that... I'm just the sort of guy who hates procrastinating. Mei: That's what it means to be diligent, Senpai. I think that's something to be proud of. Kousei: Nah, trust me... I can be pretty lazy when I want. Mei: But in front of me, at least, you're always hardworking and dependable. Kousei: Okay, sheesh. Stop flattering me. It's gonna go to my head. Mei: Ahaha! Alright. Mei: Well, good night, Senpai. Kousei: Good night. And sorry you had to wait for me earlier. Mei: That's okay. I waited because I wanted to congratulate you. Mei: Anyway, see you tomorrow! Kousei: Yeah. See you tomorrow.

Suzune: We're all out of cheese and sausages, so I'm gonna need you to make me some more. Kousei: You already ate them all? I wanted some too, you know. Suzune: Oh, stop griping. C'mon! Kousei: Alright, alright. Fine. Mei: Senpai! I want to try smoking some other things too! Kousei: Sure. I'll rummage around my fridge and see what else we can toss in the smoker. Mei: This is gonna be great! Kanna: Here's to another great year! Let's all do our best! Suzune: Alrighty. Ready to get back to work? Kousei: Yes, ma'am. Kousei: Not so much changed as added a new twist. I tried smoking the pepper first. Natsume: I can't say it looks or smells particularly different, though... Kousei: You'll see once you try it. Nozomi: Well, I'm gonna go ahead and dig in! Nozomi: That faint hint of smokiness... It's amazing how much difference it makes. Natsume: You said you smoked it yourself? Kousei: Yep. It was all Hiuchidani-san's idea. Mei: Don't be silly. You came up with the idea to smoke the black pepper. Mei: All I did was suggest that we try to make our own bacon. Natsume: Ah. So you spent the break thinking up ways to improve our menu... Natsume: That's very commendable of you. I'm impressed. Kousei: Thanks. How do you think it tastes? Kanna: I, for one, think it's delicious. It gives the dish a lot more added depth. Nozomi: I think so too. This seems like it'd be a real crowd-pleaser. Natsume: It certainly is delicious, but... Kousei: But? Natsume: I feel like the pepper's unique smokiness has a sort of... mature taste to it. Natsume: It's definitely not bad by any means, but--and this is just my personal opinion... Natsume: But I think I actually prefer the regular carbonara. Natsume: So while I'm all for adding this to our menu, I don't think it should replace the original version. Nozomi: You said you added the smoked black pepper to the pasta at the end, right? Kousei: Yeah, I did. Nozomi: In that case, why don't we just serve our regular carbonara with a shaker of smoked black pepper on the side? Nozomi: That way, customers can add as much or as little as they want. Natsume: How would we know how much to prepare in advance, though? Some customers might use a lot more than others. Suzune: A lot of beef bowl restaurants used to do the same thing with their special shichimi spices, but they had to stop the practice a little while back. Suzune: Some customers were using unbelievable amounts of spice, which ended up hurting their profits. Nozomi: Oh... I guess that won't work then. Kanna: It seems like our safest option would be to add this smoked pepper version as a separate item on the menu. Kousei: Alright. So I have all the judges' approval? Kanna: Absolutely. I think this would make a fine addition to our menu. Nozomi: Me too. Natsume: Me three. Kanna: What do you think, Mikado-san? Mikado: I believe Natsume mentioned earlier that this dish had a rather mature taste. However, many of our customers also come here specifically for our coffee and tea. Mikado: Judging from what I have gathered, this would suit their preferences well. Mikado: Therefore, I am in agreement. Kousei: Thank goodness... Mei: Way to go, Senpai! Kousei: Thanks! Kousei: I was just gonna do it at home, actually... Mikado: Among other problems, that would be quite expensive. I would not recommend you do that. Kousei: I guess that's true. Mikado: I do have some other ideas you may wish to consider. Are you free to talk after this? Kousei: Sure. I've got time. Kanna: In that case, let's call it a day here. See you tomorrow, everyone. Natsume: See you tomorrow. Nozomi: See you tomorrow! Kousei: Phew... Kousei: Huh? Hiuchidani-san? Mei: Hey. Kousei: What are you still doing here? Mei: I was waiting for you to finish. Kousei: You could've waited inside. Mei: Ahaha. I didn't want to bother you guys. Mei: Anyway, I know I should've said something earlier... but would you mind walking me home? Kousei: Sure. I don't mind. Let's go. Mei: Thanks! Mei: Congratulations on getting your new recipe approved, by the way. Kousei: Well, you helped with that. Mei: Not at all. You did this on your own, Senpai. Kousei: Nah, it's all thanks to you. I would've never come up with this idea on my own. Kousei: Seriously, thank you. I'm really grateful. Kousei: This might sound kind of melodramatic... but I think I've gained a little more confidence in myself now. Mei: Ehehe... You're gonna make me blush. I don't mean to sound melodramatic either, but, like... Mei: You've done a lot for me as well, Senpai. Ever since you've helped me open up about my left eye, I feel like a huge weight's been lifted off my shoulders. Mei: That's why I wanted to be able to return the favor if I could. Mei: I'm glad I managed to be of some small help to you. Kousei: It wasn't small at all. You were a big help. Kousei: I was hoping to do something like this before I had to deal with my exams, so I'm glad it all went so well. Mei: Oh, your exams are coming up? Kousei: At the end of the month, yeah. Mei: Does that mean you're gonna be working fewer hours? Kousei: No, I'll be working the same as usual. I'll do fine as long as I pay attention in class. Kousei: And I can always study after work too. Mei: You're a pretty diligent student, aren't you? Kousei: I don't know about that... I'm just the sort of guy who hates procrastinating. Mei: That's what it means to be diligent, Senpai. I think that's something to be proud of. Kousei: Nah, trust me... I can be pretty lazy when I want. Mei: But in front of me, at least, you're always hardworking and dependable. Kousei: Okay, sheesh. Stop flattering me. It's gonna go to my head. Mei: Ahaha! Alright. Mei: Well, good night, Senpai. Kousei: Good night. And sorry you had to wait for me earlier. Mei: That's okay. I waited because I wanted to congratulate you. Mei: Anyway, see you tomorrow! Kousei: Yeah. See you tomorrow. Mei: ...... Mei: Hmm... Exams... \n\nWhile these examples may provide some guidance, evaluate their relevance to the current conversation.
