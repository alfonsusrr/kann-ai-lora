            "Mikado: Is not about the carbonara, no. I shall leave that matter completely up to you. Kousei: Alright. I'll try preparing a few more dishes next week as an experiment. Maybe up the order limit to twenty-five. Kanna: Sounds good. Anyway, I'm sure you can guess why I've asked you two to stay behind. Mei: This is about my eye again, isn't it? Kanna: We just want to know how things are progressing, so this shouldn't take too much of your time. Has anything changed with your eye since we last spoke? Mei: No. I still don't know how to release my butterflies... Kanna: Not to worry. I'm certain you'll get there eventually. Mikado: Our main purpose in opening this cafe has always been to collect butterflies. Thanks to you, that task has been proceeding expeditiously. Mikado: Allow me to thank you for your hard work once again. We owe you our gratitude. Mei: A-All I'm doing is catching butterflies. I'd wouldn't exactly call that \"hard work\"... Mei: B-But either way, I'll continue to do my best to help! Mikado: Thank you. We appreciate it. Mei: ...... Mikado: But while I appreciate your efforts, I will not be transforming into a cat. Mei: Okay. I'm sorry. Kanna: Allow me to thank you as well, Takamine-san. Kousei: Huh? Why me? Kanna: While it was mere coincidence that brought you here to work with us, you've become an invaluable member of our team. Kanna: Many of our customers even come to our cafe specifically to eat your dishes now. Kanna: So thank you very much. You've been an incredible help to us all. Kousei: Well, I mean... this was all because of that \"problem\" I had with my soul in the first place... Kousei: But I'm glad you appreciate me. Honestly, this job has been pretty fulfilling for me too lately. Mikado: Indeed. It would appear your soul's condition has been greatly improving. Kanna: You can't let your guard down just yet, but as long as you keep heading in the right direction, you won't have anything to worry about. Kousei: Phew. That's a relief to hear. I owe it all to Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Huh? Kousei: Thanks for guiding me in the right direction. Mei: N-No, I didn't do anything. Kousei: You did. Thank you for everything. Mei: I-I... Mei: ...... Mei: U-Um, was there anything else you wanted to discuss? Kanna: No, I believe that's it. Mei: In that case, I've got something I need to do, so--! Mikado: Alright. Then we apologize for keeping you. Mei: That's okay! Anyway, I'll be going now! Kousei: Let me walk you-- Mei: Good night! Kousei: Huh? Kousei: Y-Yeah, I am... Kanna: Good night. Kousei: Yeah. Good night... Kousei: ...... Kousei: I should've known... Mei: Y-You're fine. Kousei: Freaking out? Mei: Y-Yeah... I... Um... Mei: ...... Mei: Oh, gosh... I'm so nervous... Mei: U-Umm... I think it would take too long to explain myself, so... h-here! Mei: Yes. It's... my Valentine's Day gift... to you. Kousei: Chocolate! Mei: Y-Yes. It's chocolate, and it's, um... handmade. Kousei: Handmade! Mei: Wow, you're really excited about this... Suzune-san taught me how to make it, so it should taste alright... I think. Kousei: Oh... Is that why you've been going home together lately? Mei: Yeah. I've been going to her apartment so she could teach me. Mei: She's also been helping me by asking you about your preferences and stuff... Kousei: My preferences? Oh, wait. Mei: Ahaha... Sorry. I guess I just felt kind of embarrassed... Kousei: Is that why the others said they weren't giving me any chocolate this year? So this would be a surprise? Mei: What? I don't know anything about that... Mei: But the others knew I was planning on giving you my own chocolate, so... I guess that could be why they did that... Kousei: Phew. I thought for sure you hated me or something... Mei: Wh-What?! Of course not! Why would you think that? Kousei: I mean, you've been avoiding me lately, haven't you? Mei: I-I wasn't... I mean... Well, maybe a little... Kousei: See? Mei: That's only because I didn't want you to find out I was preparing chocolate for you... Mei: But... I'm sorry for acting so weird. I didn't mean to give you the wrong idea. Kousei: It's alright. I've been really anxious these past few days, so it's a relief to know the truth. Mei: Urk... I'm sorry... Kousei: Handmade chocolate, though... This is more than I expected. Thank you. Mei: Um, if you'd like... you're welcome to go ahead and eat it... Kousei: Right now? Mei: Yeah. I actually brought you a fork too. Kousei: To be honest, I was planning to go home and savor it there... Mei: N-No, please! You can't! You can't keep me waiting that long! Mei: My heart's already pounding so fast it's about to explode! Mei: I need to know how you think it tastes right now... or else I'm going to die! Kousei: A-Alright. I'll have a bite... Mei: Please do! There are two inside, so at least try one of them! Right now! Mei: Something like that. It's called a chocolate fondant. Kousei: Sounds fancy. Was it hard to make? Mei: Not at all. Suzune-san was there to guide me through every single step. Mei: Ah, but just for the record--I made this all by myself! And I think I did a pretty good job! Mei: Though, um... it was a lot crispier on the outside when it came out of the oven, but it might be a bit soggy by now. Mei: But it shouldn't taste bad! This was Suzune-san's own personal recipe! I baked it with the utmost care! Mei: The flavor should be to your liking as well! So p-please, go ahead and try some! Kousei: Alright... don't mind if I do then. Mei: H-Help yourself! Kousei: ...... Mei: H-Hello? Kousei: ...... Mei: Senpai? Kousei: ...... Mei: Um... Does it... taste bad? Kousei: It's delicious. Mei: R-Really? Oh, thank goodness! Kousei: Oh god... It's so delicious... Mei: Wait, what? Huh? Kousei: How? How can something taste THIS good?! Mei: O-Oh, come on... You're exaggerating... Kousei: *sniffle*... Mei: Wait, are you crying? You're not pretending, are you? No way. Like, seriously? You're seriously crying? Kousei: I can't help it... Mei: O-Okay? Kousei: Everyone kept saying they wouldn't be giving me any chocolate... Mei: Oh... right. They said it'd be a hassle to get return gifts for everyone. Kousei: Even Nozomi, who usually gives me chocolates every year... gave me nothing. Mei: Wait, every year? Oh, right. You and Nozomi-chan are childhood friends. Kousei: Yeah, but she said she'd only been giving them to me out of force of habit... Mei: Oh... Err... I'm not sure what to say to that. Kousei: In the end, the only person who gave me chocolates was you... And handmade chocolate too... Kousei: Thank you... Thank you, Hiuchidani-san! Mei: I didn't think you'd be THIS emotional... but I'm glad you like it. Mei: But I can't say I was expecting you to start crying... It's a little, um, creepy. Kousei: Yeah, I know. I guess I tried too hard to sell it. Mei: Ah! I KNEW you were pretending, you stinker! Mei: Do you really mean that? Kousei: Yeah. I mean it. Seriously. Kousei: I could finish off both these chocolates right here if I'm not careful. Mei: Phew... Kousei: There's no way you could've gone wrong with Suzune-san's recipe. Mei: Yeah, but still... Kousei: Besides, even if it DID taste bad, I'd never say it to your face. Mei: What? So it really DOES taste bad?! Kousei: No, no. It's delicious. Really. Mei: *sigh*... My heart's pounding so much. Like, I've been feeling so anxious lately. That's why I've been acting so weird... Mei: When I was making the chocolate by hand, I began to understand how you feel, Senpai. Mei: Making food for someone else to eat is incredibly stressful and nerve-wracking... Mei: But it's also really fun, trying to make something that the person will like. Mei: And when you do get that confirmation from them that they like it... Mei: It makes you happier than words can describe! Kousei: I already told you. Why don't you believe me? Mei: Because I'm worried! Kousei: Didn't you taste it yourself beforehand? Mei: Well, yeah. I tried one I made from the same batch, but still... Kousei: It was delicious, wasn't it? Mei: It was, but this one's gone all cold! It's not FRESH! Kousei: Even so, it tastes delicious. Mei: Really? Really, really? Kousei: If you're really that worried about the taste, why don't you try some yourself? Kousei: See? I told you. Mei: Phew... Wait. Ah... Ahh! Kousei: What? Mei: Th-Th-Th-That was... an i-i-indirect k-ki--! Kousei: Oh, right. Sorry. You're pretty sensitive about these sorts of things, aren't you? Mei: O-O-Oh, no! It doesn't bothe--well... i-it does, I guess... Kousei: My bad. I totally forgot. Mei: I-I mean... As long as it's you, I... Mei: ...... Mei: U-U-Umm! Kousei: Hm? Mei: Suzune-san told me something... Kousei: Yeah? Mei: She said that you'd be happy receiving any kind of chocolate for Valentine's Day... Kousei: It's true. I'm pretty thrilled right now. Thank you, seriously. Mei: You're welcome... But she also said that... if I gave you handmade chocolate... Mei: Then... Umm... Kousei: Hm? Mei: Then you'd... umm! Kousei: Yeah? Mei: You'd think that... it meant I had genuine feelings for you... Kousei: O-Oh, come on! I can't believe she told you that too! Mei: Y-Yes... That's what she said... Kousei: I, er, I mean... I was only half-joking when I said that... Mei: You were... joking? Kousei: Y-Yeah. I was just messing with her... Kousei: B-But don't worry! I'm not dumb enough to think you like me just because of a couple chocolates! Mei: ...... Mei: I wouldn't mind... if you thought I did... though. Kousei: O-Okay? Kousei: ...... Kousei: Wait, what?! Mei: ...... Kousei: ...... Kousei: ...... Mei: Um... Mei: ...... Mei: During our girls' night out the other day... everyone kept asking me about that time we went to the pool together... Mei: Eventually, the conversation turned to... whether or not I had f-feelings for you, Senpai... Mei: I said I didn't know... but everyone else said it was obvious that I did... Mei: I thought they might be right... but I've never had any sort of romantic experience before... so I wasn't sure. Mei: I can't say I really understand my own feelings... but at the very least, I do know that you're a very important person to me. Mei: That's... what I wanted to tell you today. Mei: But... Mei: ...... Mei: Just now, I realized that... I really do... love you, Senpai. Mei: I mean, love is supposed to make your heart pound, isn't it? But when I'm with you, it's almost the opposite... I feel so relaxed that I thought it couldn't be love. Mei: But right now... my heart is pounding like crazy. Even though all I'm doing is telling you how I feel... my chest feels like it's about to burst. Mei: When I made up my mind to give you these chocolates... and when I decided to ask Suzune-san to teach me how to make them... Mei: While I practiced... This morning... During work... And while I was sitting here waiting for you earlier too... Mei: My heart wouldn't stop pounding. Mei: You wouldn't believe how nervous I felt. Mei: The truth is... I've had feelings for you all this time. Mei: So it's time I worked up the courage to say it. Mei: I... I think I love you, Senpai. Mei: No, wait... That doesn't sound right... Mei: ...... Mei: Senpai... I love you. Mei: I love the way you thank me, even when I've barely done anything... Mei: I love the way you're so nice to me, and lend an ear to all my worries... Mei: And I love so many other things about you too. Mei: So please... Mei: ...... Mei: Please... go out with me. Mei: Please... take me as your girlfriend. Mei: I... want to be with you from now on, Senpai. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Right now... my heart's also hammering like crazy. Kousei: When I thought you were avoiding me... it made me feel so lonely and so worried. Kousei: I was afraid you didn't like me, and I became really depressed. Kousei: Especially when you ran off without giving me any chocolate. Kousei: But then--you messaged to ask if we could meet. My heart wouldn't stop pounding on the way here. Kousei: This whole day's been a roller coaster of emotions for me. Kousei: But if what I'm feeling is the same thing you are... then I'm in love too. Kousei: In love with you, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Ah... Urk... Kousei: I love you too, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: S-So... Kousei: I want you to go out with me. Mei: ...... Mei: Ahhh... Mei: I'm a total mess of emotions right now... Kousei: Me too... My face must be burning up right now. Mei: ...... Kousei: ...... Mei: ...... Kousei: Uh... if you don't mind... Mei: Huh? Kousei: Could I call you by your first name? It'd feel oddly formal... if I kept using your last name. Mei: Y-Yeah, I agree... Go ahead. You don't have to use an honorific either... if you don't want. Kousei: Oh... Mei: Yeah. You can just call me Mei. Kousei: M... M-M-M... Mei: You're stammering so much... Kousei: I-I can't help it. I've never called you this before... Mei: That's fine. I can be patient. Kousei: M-Mei... Mei: There you go. Ehehe... Kousei: What about you? Mei: Huh? Kousei: Will you start calling me by my name? Mei: Senpai? Kousei: That's not what it says on my birth certificate. Mei: Urk... Mei: ...... Mei: Kousei... san? Kousei: You can drop the honorific too. Mei: Well... I mean, I'm younger than you, so... Mei: But maybe I could call you Kou-kun instead-- Mei: No, wait. That's even more embarrassing. Kousei: Yeah... That's pretty embarrassing for me too. Mei: Well, for now... I'm only going to use your first name when we're alone together. Kousei: A-Alright. I guess we wouldn't want the others to tease us about it. Mei: E-Exactly. Kousei: ...... Mei: ...... Kousei: Y-Yeah. I mean, if that's okay with you... Mei: O-Of course it is! Mei: ...... Mei: Finally... I'm your girlfriend! "

Kanna: You've got this all wrong. Mikado: How, pray tell? I will not be tricked. Kanna: We don't expect you to ingratiate or toady up to anyone. That's something a normal cat would do.

Kanna: Your refinement and dignified bearing are bound to captivate all who see it. Mikado: Hmm... Kanna: It should be a simple matter for you, Your Excellency. You're a bona fide nobleman. A duke, no less. Mikado: Indeed... Indeed I am... Kanna: But of course, we won't force you. Kanna: If you're too chicken, we'll just give up on the idea. Mikado: Hmph! Please. Nothing could be simpler for a nobleman such as I. Kanna: So you'll allow us to take your picture? Mikado: Indeed. I shall show you the difference in class between a regular cat and a Cat Sidhe! Mikado: Anything to be spared of the horror of dry kibble... Kanna: Thank you very much! Heh. Natsume & Kousei: Wow... Kousei: Women scare me sometimes. Natsume: I think that was just His Excellency's pride getting the better of him. But, hmm. I should've tried flattery instead. Kanna: Well, we've known each other for many years. I know which of his buttons to press. Kanna: And honestly, while he acted all embarrassed, I don't think he hates the idea as much as he'd like you to think. Kousei: Oh, really? Kanna: If he was seriously opposed to it, I wouldn't have been able to win him over so easily. Natsume: But do you think he might change his mind later? Kanna: It's certainly a possibility. Natsume: In that case, we'd better take as many photos now, while we can. Kanna: I agree. Strike while the iron's hot. Kanna: You Excellency? Why don't we take a little test photo? Mikado: This instant? I would like to groom my fur beforehand, if possible... Kousei: What are you, a girl? Natsume: Don't worry, Your Excellency. Your fur is always impeccable. All we're asking for is one photo. Just one. Mikado: Well, alright. Natsume: Okay, here we go! Kanna: Aww, that's perfect! What a striking pose! So perfect! Natsume: What form. Look at those rippling muscles. That astonishing bulk. Unbelievable. Kousei: Uh, I'm not sure those are the compliments he's looking for. Natsume: But technically speaking, His Excellency is a male. Don't guys like to be complimented on their figure? Kousei: Hmm, I might not be the best person to ask... Mikado: Like this? Or would this be better? Natsume: Look at those chiseled abs. Those sculpted obliques. Natsume: Majestic! The Cat Sidhe's own Leonidas! Kousei: He's a duke, not a king. "

We get into all sorts of trouble together, but I love her to bits!\n\nThen there's Moka-chan. She's the owner of the cafe where I work as a waitress, and she's got a heart of gold. Always looking out for everyone and making sure we're all happy.\n\nAnd finally, there's Haruhi-san. She's... well, that's a bit complicated. Let's just say she's a special case, even among other Shinigami like me! But despite her tough exterior, she's got a soft spot deep down.\n\nAnd of course, I've also got a few acquaintances and colleagues at the cafe who are always willing to lend a hand (or a sympathetic ear) when needed.

He's a good guy and always gives me a hard time about my \"ancient\" knowledge, but I think that just means he likes me.\n\nAnd last but not least, there's Kiyokawa Kokoro, another regular customer who comes in to study for her exams. She's really sweet and always brings in some delicious pastries to share with the rest of us.\n\nBut even though they're my friends, sometimes I have to go off and do... other things. You know, as a shinigami (that's a death god, by the way). That can be a bit tricky, since I have to keep my duties a secret from the living. But they always support me and make sure everything runs smoothly while I'm away.\n\nSo, that's who my friends are! Not too shabby for an old-fashioned girl like me, huh?",

Kanna: I get that... but I have no idea where to even begin. Kousei: Well, let's see... Why don't we start by installing your social media and messaging apps first? Kanna: Oh, I know that one! The program everyone uses to chat with each other is called LIME! Kanna: But how do I go about installing it? There's no way I can fit a CD-ROM into this tiny thing. Kousei: What? A CD-ROM? You're confusing me. Kousei: Apps are downloaded on the app store, like this... Just press this button, and it'll automatically begin installing. Kanna: Whoa... Kousei: Now all you need to do is launch it and complete the initial setup. Kanna: I see. And now I'll be able to keep in contact with everyone at work? Kousei: Well, after you exchange Lime IDs. Kanna: Um... will you exchange IDs with me, Takamine-san? Kousei: Sure. Kanna: Is that it? Kousei: Yep. Now we can send messages to each other. Kousei: That's because of the message I sent. See? Kanna: Oh... \"Hello,\" it says. Kanna: ...... Kanna: Let's see... Kousei: ...... Kousei: Pfft. Kanna: Takamine-san? Kousei: You misspelled it. Kanna: What? Kousei: It says \"Hellp.\" Ahaha... Kanna: It was a simple typo! I'm new to this, okay? There's no need to laugh so hard... Kousei: Sorry, sorry. Kanna: Is there a way to fix it? Kousei: Hmm... Kousei: Why don't you try figuring that out on your own? It'll help you familiarize yourself with how the phone works. Kanna: No way! You can't just leave me to sink or swim! That's too cruel! Kousei: ...... Kanna: Do you know how hard I tried to find the edit button? Kousei: I thought it'd be a good learning experience. Now you know to double check your messages before sending them. Kanna: Maybe so... but I wish you'd told me that beforehand. Kanna: Also, you were laughing way too hard at me for making a simple typo. Kousei: My bad. Kousei: It was just kinda cute seeing you make such an uncharacteristic mistake. Couldn't help myself. Kanna: That's a terrible excuse. Bullying a girl so you can laugh at her isn't only childish, but rude as well. Kanna: It's no wonder you haven't lost your virginity. Kousei: Ouch. That hurts, you know... Kousei: But you're right. It was childish. I'm really sorry. Kousei: I'll make it up to you. Kanna: Make it up to me how? Kousei: I'll take you out to dinner. Tonight, if you'd like. What do you say? Mei: Oh? It's Kanna-san and Kousei-senpai. Nozomi: What are you guys doing here? Kousei: Doing a little shopping. Kousei: What about you two? Mei: Since it's our day off, we wanted to go hang out together as a breather. Nozomi: But it's a weekday, meaning we couldn't go anywhere far away, so we decided to just go somewhere for dinner. Mei: Plus, we just got our paychecks, so we can splurge a little! Nozomi: What are you doing here with Kanna-san, though? Nozomi: A-Are you guys on a... on a date? Mei: Wait. What? I didn't know you two were dating. Kousei: No, we weren't doing anything like that. Kousei: Akizuki-san finally decided to buy a smartphone, so I just came along to help her choose a good model. Nozomi: Oh, is that right? Kousei: Anyway, now that we've bought it, we were thinking of having dinner together. Mei: That sounds exactly like a date to me. You don't need to deny it. Kousei: Sorry to disappoint, but it's not a date. I'm just treating her to dinner as an apology. Nozomi: Apology? Kanna: Takamine-san here was making fun of my lack of knowledge concerning smartphones. Kanna: He was being downright rude. Kousei: Oh, come on. I already said I was sorry... Nozomi: I'm not surprised. He can be a real jerk sometimes. Kousei: Lay off, Nozomi. Nozomi: Hmph. You know it's true. Mei: You said you already finished picking out a phone? Kanna: Yes. This is it right here. Mei: Oh, that's the one that just came out. The camera's supposed to be really good. Mei: Give me your ID! Nozomi: Ohh! Me too, me too! Kanna: Why, of course! Nozomi: Oh, right. To exchange contact info, you have to-- Kanna: Do this, and... show you the QR code, right? Mei: Yep! Hold on while I scan it... Nozomi: Okay! I just sent you a message, so make sure to add me. Mei: I sent you one just now too. Kanna: Great! Kanna: *giggle* Adding people to my contacts list makes me much happier than I imagined it would. Kousei: Maybe we should make a group chat. Nozomi: Oh, good idea! Kanna: What's that? Kousei: It allows us to all message each other at once, instead of doing it individually. Kanna: Oh, so it's like an internet forum? Mei: So we didn't actually have a group chat before? Thank goodness... Mei: Sometimes I got worried that I was the only one who wasn't invited. I was afraid you all secretly hated me... Kousei: Don't be silly. Of course we don't. Kousei: We just never had much need for one before. Nozomi: You never really message me all that much anyway. Kousei: Well, I don't have any reason to bother you unless I need something. Besides, I see you at work almost every day anyway. Mei: Let's go ahead and set up the group chat then! Kousei: I don't mind... but do we really have that much to contact each other about? Nozomi: We can always use it to talk about things besides work. Mei: Yeah. We can just keep it casual. For example-- Mei: By creating an album to share pictures with each other! Nozomi: Ohh, good idea! I'm gonna post my pictures of the cafe too! Nozomi: What do you mean? These are all photos we took at the cafe. Mei: Photos of Suzune-san's cakes, photos of us wearing our new uniforms, and photos of us all exhausted after our first day of work. Mei: I'm gonna post that photo the three of us took together last time too. Kanna: Are you sure I can have this photo too? Nozomi: Of course! Kanna: Thank you... very much. Kanna: This is kind of embarrassing. I've never really taken any photos before. Mei: Well, now that you've got such a high-quality camera, you might as well put it to good use! Kanna: Oh! That reminds me--there's something I want to ask you, Mei-san. Kanna: I'd like to start taking some of my own photos from now on, to use for advertising, and I was wondering if you could give me a few pointers. Mei: Oh, sure! I'd be happy to teach you anytime. Mei: I'm curious to see just how good your phone's camera is myself. Kanna: In that case, why don't we all have dinner together? Mei: Like, right now? Well... Kousei: I told you, we weren't on a date. You don't need to worry about us. Nozomi: That's not the problem. She's saying she'd feel bad making you for pay for all three of us. Kousei: What? I only promised to pay for Akizuki-san. Nozomi: Aww... You're gonna make us pay? Kousei: Well, if you come, I guess I can pay for everyone. Nozomi: Wait, what? Seriously? I was half-kidding, you know. Kousei: That means you were half-serious too. But yeah, it's fine. Kousei: You two deserve a reward for all your hard work at the cafe. Plus, I am the man here. And older than you both. Nozomi: That's why I love you, Kousei-kun! Kousei: You're a real sweet-talker, you know that? Nozomi: Not as good as you, though. Mei: You're willing to pay for me too? Really? Kousei: I'd feel bad if you were the only one who had to pay for yourself. Mei: Well, alright then. Thank you so much! Kousei: Hey, Suzune-san. Where are you headed? Suzune: I was trying some cake from this popular place nearby for research purposes. What about you guys? Kousei: We were just talking about having dinner together, actually. Nozomi: Would you like to come with us too? Mei: It must've been fate that you ran into us! Since we're all here, we might as well eat together! Suzune: I was also about to grab a bite somewhere before heading home, so I guess I don't mind... Kousei: We just happened to run into each other here by accident too, so don't worry. You're not imposing. Suzune: Ah. Well, alright then. Kanna: But with the five of us now... it kind of feels like we're leaving Natsume-san out. Nozomi: That's true. Kousei: I don't think she'd be too bothered by it. Kousei: She doesn't like huge gatherings anyway. She'd probably just turn us down. Nozomi: Maybe, but it doesn't feel nice to find out about these things after the fact. Kousei: True. There's a big difference between turning down an invitation and not being invited in the first place. Mei: She might seem like type of person who'd say \"meals are strictly supposed to be a private affair,\" but I bet she'd be crushed if she found out she wasn't invited. Mei: You know how Natsume-senpai can be a bit of a tsundere sometimes. Natsume: Who are you calling a tsundere? Mei: Ahh! Natsume-senpai?! What are YOU doing here?! Natsume: I was shopping for dinner, and some other things. Natsume: But then I saw a bunch of familiar faces all together... Speaking of which, why'd you randomly share that album earlier? Nozomi: Kanna-san bought a new smartphone today. Suzune: Oh, really? Took you long enough. Kousei: Then we realized we never made a work group chat, and decided now would be a good opportunity to make one. Mei: And I thought we might as well share our photos with everyone. Mei: Like, doesn't it feel lonely when you buy a new phone and it has nothing in it? Nozomi: I know what you mean. Especially for Kanna-san, since she has no data to transfer over. Kousei: Is it? "

            "Kanna: I suppose the roller coaster went up quite high as well, but it was going a bit too fast for me to appreciate the view. Kousei: It really is pretty, isn't it? Kanna: It is. Oh, I should take a picture. Kanna: Yes, of course! I'm having a blast. Kousei: Glad to hear it. Kanna: I made so many fun memories today, eating ramen AND visiting an amusement park for the first time. Kanna: I really appreciate you inviting me along. Thank you very much. Kousei: Oh, no. Thank you for agreeing to come with me. Kanna: I have to ask, though... why an amusement park? Kousei: What do you mean? Kanna: I mean, why did we come here? What was it that you needed to do at an amusement park? Kanna: Was there any reason to bring me along too? Ah--not that I don't appreciate it. I really am enjoying myself. Kanna: But I was having so much fun that I completely forgot to ask what you wanted to do here in the first place. Kousei: Right... Kousei: Well, don't worry about it. I've already done what I came here to do. Kanna: You did? Already? Kanna: Well, I hope I wasn't getting in the way. Kousei: It's nothing much... but here. I got you a new case and a portable charger for your phone. Kanna: ...... Kousei: It might be a little too practical for a gift, but I thought it'd be better than something you'd never use. Kanna: Thank you... very much... Kousei: Yeah, of course. Thank you. Kousei: This makes me really happy. Seriously. Kanna: Me too. But... are you sure about this? Kousei: What? Kanna: Giving me this present... and spending your holiday with me. I thought you would have wanted to spend it with someone else. Kousei: Why would I? If anything, there wouldn't have been any point coming here without you. Kanna: What do you mean? Kousei: ...... Kousei: I wanted to come with YOU, Akizuki-san. Kanna: H-Huh? Wait... Whaaat? Kanna: ...... Kanna: Up until now... I haven't explained very much about myself to you, or about us Grim Reapers, have I? Kousei: Huh? O-Oh, no. I guess not. Kanna: This seems like a good opportunity to do so. Will you listen to what I have to say? I want you to understand something, Takamine-san. Kousei: Like, right now? Kanna: Right now. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Alright. Kanna: Thank you. Now then... Where do I begin? Kousei: Well, for starters, you did tell me before that your job was to guide the souls of the dead, and capture wayward butterflies. Kanna: What I'm about to tell you goes beyond that. Kanna: I told you that butterflies were remnants of lingering souls that have lost their attachment to life, didn't I? Kanna: But what do you think happens to these butterflies once I collect them and return them to the other side? Kousei: \"What happens to them\"? Well... they get reincarnated, don't they? Kousei: I thought that's why you captured them in the first place. Kanna: That is the eventual goal, yes, but first, it's necessary for them to regain their will to continue living. Kanna: And that is why souls that become butterflies are returned to the world in a different form. Kanna: They are then given a certain job. A job that involves touching the lives of many different people. Through this, they are meant to regain an interest and attachment to the world around them. Kousei: Wait... Kousei: So what you're saying is-- Kanna: Yes. Grim Reapers are temporary beings. It's like a transitional phase that prepares us to be born anew. Kanna: That is why we do not experience physical change, nor are we able to die. Kousei: So once this transitional phase ends... you'll be reincarnated for real? Kanna: Indeed. I will be born again, and lead a new life once more. Kousei: ...... Kanna: I've been enjoying myself a lot. Kanna: The time we've spent today at the amusement park. The ramen we had for lunch, and at the yakiniku we had the other day, too. Filling my phone with more and more memories. Kanna: I've been living for quite a long time now, but this has been the most fun I've ever had. Kanna: Working together with you, and Natsume-san, and Nozomi-san, and Mei-san, and Suzune-san... Kanna: Seeing so many customers smile and tell us how delicious our food is... All of it has made me so happy. Kanna: Compared to all the years I've lived until now, this may only be an extremely short period of time. Kanna: But it's also been... the brightest time of my life. Kanna: Every single day feels so joyous, and so fulfilling. Kousei: N-No problem. I'm... glad you had fun. Kousei: ...... Kousei: But it's only natural, since it's also the first time I've ever confessed to anyone. Kousei: ...... Kousei: If anything, it feels like there's been no clear outcome. Kousei: Urgh... Kousei: Maybe it would've been better if she'd just outright rejected me after all? Kousei: No, that would probably just hurt even more. I might've even cried... Kousei: ...... Kousei: Arrgghh! This is torture! Kanna: ...... Mikado: What is the matter? Did something happen? Kanna: You can tell? Mikado: Obviously. Kanna: ...... Mikado: If you want me to leave you alone, then stop acting like that. Mikado: It only makes you seem like some petulant child who wants someone to listen to them. Kanna: The truth is, the outing Takamine-san invited me on today... was apparently a Christmas date. Mikado: Did you two get into a fight or something? Kanna: No. Quite the opposite, actually. Kanna: I think Takamine-san wanted to confess to me... Probably. Mikado: Probably? Kanna: I stopped him before he could say it, and told him that I wouldn't be around for much longer. Mikado: I see. Kanna: I just want him to be happy. That is my only wish. Mikado: But he chose YOU, did he not? Kanna: That's exactly why I can't reciprocate his feelings. It can't be me. It has to be someone who he can actually be with. Mikado: I suppose that is true... Kanna: Look at him now. He's completely changed from before. He's become such a positive person. Kanna: But even so, I can't be the one to be with him. He deserves to find true, lasting happiness this time. Mikado: ...... "

            "Kanna: If the situation continues to go downhill, I'm worried that a real witch hunt or witch trial might take place. Mikado: Of course, I doubt we have to worry about anyone being burned at the stake. However, it is likely that Mei will be shunned even worse than before. Kousei: We have to make things right with her friend then. Kanna: Right. I'd like to see them make up as soon as possible. Kanna: But the question is... just how much does Mei-san's friend believe in her powers? Kanna: Hopefully, all she thinks is that Mei-san's \"spell\" makes her feel better; not that it actually fixes her problem. Kanna: If that's the case, then it may be possible to sweep this incident under the rug by refraining from using her powers again in the future... Mikado: But if she truly believes that Mei possesses unusual abilities, then that complicates things. Mikado: Even if they were to reconcile with each other, her perception of Mei as \"abnormal\" would inevitably become a source of discord between them. Kanna: I'm inclined to agree... In which case, perhaps it would be best to bring her into the fold. Kousei: Well, whatever we decide, what am I supposed to tell Mei? I'd rather avoid mentioning any of that witch hunt or witch trial stuff. Kousei: I don't want to make it sound like her friend has ill-intentions either... Kanna: Let me handle it. I'll talk to her. Kanna: As it so happens, I'm going to meet her after this anyway. Kousei: Huh? You are? Kanna: Yes. She's having a study session over at Suzune-san's apartment, and I was invited to go as well. Kousei: Oh... She did mention she asked Shiki-san to help her study. That was today? Kanna: I know you're worried about her as her boyfriend, but please let me handle it. I'll speak to her. Kousei: Alright. I'll leave it to you. Mikado: Still... I do feel partly responsible for all of this. It was I who urged her to begin actively using her powers, after all. Kousei: Er, this actually happened back when Mei was still in the swimming club. Mikado: Oh, I see. So this was before we met. Mikado: Still, all the more reason we ought to have noticed Mei's existence even sooner. Mikado: If we had, we could have taught her how to use her powers before this happened. Kanna: There's no point in lamenting over hypotheticals, Your Excellency. Mikado: I suppose you're right. In any case, we'll decide after you talk to her. Kanna: Right. Anyway, I'd better get going soon. I'm already running late. Kousei: See you later. Kanna: See you later. Kanna: Sorry I'm late! Suzune: There she is. Mei & Nozomi: Good evening! Kanna: Good evening. It's been a long time since our last one of these, huh? Natsume: What was holding you up at the cafe? Kanna: Just some business with the smoker. It didn't seem like I was really needed, though, so I left the rest to Mikado-san. Suzune: Come on, take a seat. Kanna: Thank you. Suzune: Without further ado! Now that everyone's here, let's start talking juicy stories! Mei: Come again? Nozomi: Juicy stories? Kanna: I was told that this was supposed to be a study session... Now I see why I was invited too. Natsume: Well, Suzune-san's already started drinking. Mei: She opened her first can of beer before we could even open our textbooks. Suzune: I wanted a drink, so what? Not like there's anything for me to teach you anyway. Nozomi: Um, Natsume-san? About this question here... Natsume: Which one? Suzune: Whoa now. You're not seriously studying, are you? This isn't the time for that. Mei: This is exactly the time, actually... Suzune: That's where you're wrong. Now's the time for you to spill all the juicy details about how far you and Kousei have gone! Mei: What? No way. Absolutely not. Kanna & Natsume & Nozomi: ...... Mei: Why is everyone suddenly sitting at attention? And you too, Nozomi-chan? Nozomi: Ahaha... Sorry. To be honest, I'm more interested in hearing about that than studying... Mei: *sigh*... Alright, alright... I guess we're not getting any studying done... Suzune: So how'd it go? Did you two manage to talk things out? Mei: Talk what out? Suzune: You know. How far he wanted to take things and all that. Mei: Well... yes... We did talk about it... Kanna: Oh-ho? Your face is turning rather red. Natsume: Ah. You've kissed, haven't you? Mei: ...... Nozomi: Ahh! You did?! Suzune: Hold on a second. Something's off about her reaction. Kanna: Somehow... She seems a little flustered... Natsume: What? No way... Seriously? Have you actually... Mei: ...... Suzune: What? You're not saying anything... Mei-san, don't tell me... Mei: ...... Suzune: You did the deed? Mei: ...... Suzune: From start to finish? Mei: ...... Mei: I-I will refrain from answering that question... Suzune: Oh my gosh! You guys actually did it! Natsume: No way. That's way too... I mean, you literally just started dating, didn't you? How many days has it been? Nozomi: They started going out on Valentine's Day, so... including today, it's been five days? Kanna: Then that means on the third or fourth day, you already... Natsume: A-Aren't you taking things a little too fast? I know we egged you on and all, but still... isn't that a little too fast?! Suzune: When was it? What day? Tell us! Mei: Wh-What? Suzune: Wait. Are you implying you've done it more than once? How many times have you had sex already? Natsume: Seriously? You've done it multiple times in just five days?! Nozomi: Wow... I'm in total awe, Mei-chan... Kanna: It's hard to believe that our pure, innocent little Mei-san has lost her virginity to a man... Natsume: And not just the one time... Suzune: Letting Kousei penetrate her petite body with his ding-a-ling over and over... Natsume: And sucking on it too... Suzune: His ding-a-ling... Natsume: His ding-a-ling... Mei: Um... I get that you like saying that word, but can you please stop repeating it? Suzune: Lewdidani... Natsume: Lewdidani Mei... Mei: Would you stop it already?! It's not funny! I don't even know what you're saying anymore! Suzune: Just come clean already. You guys had sex, didn't you? Mei: Well... y-yeah, we did. So what? Suzune: How many times? Mei: Wh-Why do I have to answer that?! Suzune: How many times?! Mei: Fine. Just twice. Suzune: Twice?! Natsume: Did you give him any blowjobs? Mei: Y-You're really curious about that, aren't you, Natsume-senpai? Natsume: Answer me. Did you or did you not? Mei: Yes. Natsume: Oh... Suzune: ...... Mei: Huh? Why did everyone go quiet all of a sudden? Kanna: The fact that the most pure and innocent one out of all of us is now the only one to have gone that far with a man is quite the shock, to be honest. Mei: What? But you're the ones who forced me to tell you about it... Suzune: I can't even tease her about it anymore... Natsume: She now has more life experience than the rest of us... Mei: More LIFE experience? That's a bit of a stretch... Nozomi: Well, I'm happy for you. I'm glad things are going well. Mei: Y-Yeah, thanks to you guys... We're doing very well... Kanna: Still, I have to say things are moving very fast between you two. Not to be rude, but I always imagined Takamine-san to be a bit of a chicken. Nozomi: Ehehe. He is definitely a bit of a late bloomer. Mei: Well, you know... Not that I'm any better, but Kou-kun-- Suzune & Natsume: Kou-kun?! Mei: Urgh... I've done it now... Nozomi: Aww. That's what you call him when you're alone? Mei: Ahh, gosh! I should've been more careful! Kanna: Takamine-san accidentally called you \"Mei\" earlier too. Natsume: What a couple of lovebirds... Suzune: Alright, we get it. No need to rub it in... Mei: I'm NOT doing that! Calling him Kou-kun was an accident, but everything else I only said because you forced me to! I'm DEFINITELY not trying to brag! Suzune: Ahh, I can't take this. I need another drink. Natsume: Can you get me one too? Suzune: Sure can. Join the party. Mei: Wait... I thought we were studying... Suzune: All I have is beer. That okay? Natsume: That's fine. Thank you. Kanna: I guess this is only the beginning. Mei: I mean, I had a feeling that was going to happen, but still... Mei: ...... Mei: Man, why'd I even come here? Nozomi: Ahaha... Nozomi: Goodnight, everyone! Mei: Goodnight! Natsume: Alright, I'm headed this way. Goodnight. Mei: Goodnight! Kanna: Have a good night. Mei: Well, I'm headed this way too. Kanna: Let me walk you home. Mei: Huh? That's okay. It's not that far from here. Kanna: I have a little something to discuss, actually. Mei: O-Oh, okay. Did... Did Kousei-senpai tell you about it? Kanna: You can call him Kou-kun. I don't mind. Mei: N-No. I'm not falling for that! Kanna: Nihihi. Come. Let's walk while we talk. Mei: Okay. Kanna: I hear that you and your friend have had something of a falling-out. Mei: I had a feeling that was what this was about... Yeah, it's true. Because of my eye. Mei: Now I understand why you warned me so many times not to attract attention to the power of my eye. Mei: But because I used it so carelessly... Kanna: Your friend became dependent on its power. Mei: Right. If only I'd tried to help her in secret, things might not have turned out this way... Mei: But... I only realize my mistake in hindsight. Kanna: Indeed. If she hadn't known that this \"magic spell\" was your doing, she may not have come to rely on it. Mei: Yeah... I'm sorry. Kanna: There's no need to apologize. It's not as if you were abusing your power. In fact, you even tried keep your left eye hidden. Mei: Well... I suppose. Kanna: All you did was make a decision to use your power to help your friend. I can't blame you for that. Kanna: And in the first place, this happened before we'd even met. If this were a more recent incident, I may have scolded you a little, but that's not the case. Mei: Still, though... I feel like it was a rash decision. Kanna: Let me to ask you something. Did you quit the swim team because you were being blamed for not using your powers? Mei: Uh... Well... Kanna: Rest assured. I won't tell Takamine-san. This is between us. Mei: ...... Mei: It definitely became... uncomfortable for me. Mei: It's true that the others criticized me for not using my spell... Mei: But that's not the only reason I left. Kanna: You felt that if you didn't leave, your friend would only continue relying on your powers. Mei: Yes. I realized that my being there wasn't good for her. Mei: So I made up my mind, and quit the team. Mei: I was confident that she, of all people, could overcome her struggles even without my help. Mei: But... Kanna: Your friend's mental state still hasn't recovered. Mei: So it seems. And what's more, it seems like she's angry at me too... Mei: I, um... I know it's my own fault she's angry with me, so I can't do anything about that. Mei: But if it's because of my spell that her slump is still going on, then I can't just keep my distance from her anymore... Kanna: You want to do something for her. Mei: Yes. But even if I offered to help, I get the feeling she'd only ask me to cast my spell on her again... so I don't know what to do. Mei: Oh... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to ramble on about my personal problems like that. Kanna: Not at all. Kanna: If your friend is attracting butterflies, then her situation is of concern to me as well. Kanna: But that said, we don't have any sort of connection with her that would give us an excuse to intervene. Mei: That's true... I'll try to think of something on my own. Kanna: Oh, you don't have to do that. I don't plan on dumping all the responsibility on you, Mei-san. Mei: But this is all my fault in the first place, so... Kanna: Don't be so reserved. We're not strangers anymore, are we? Kanna: Or so I'm sure Takamine-san would say. Mei: Ah... Mei: ...... Mei: Would you... be willing to lend a hand? Kanna: Why of course. I'll do everything in my power can to help. Mei: Th-Thank you so much! Kanna: Let's try to look at things in a positive light. Since your friend knows about the sort of powers you possess... Kanna: Perhaps it would be a good idea to bring her into the fold as well. Mei: Bring her in? You mean, invite her to work at the cafe too? Kanna: Well, not that far. But if you could invite her to the cafe as a customer, that would give us a chance to establish a connection with her. Mei: Ohh, okay... Kanna: Once we see how she's doing, we can explain to her about her butterflies. Mei: And about my eye too, right? Kanna: Let's try to avoid that for now. All she needs to know is that you're the one who drove away her butterflies. Mei: ...... Kanna: Does it bother you, having to hide things from your friends? Mei: No... I've been hiding the truth about my eye for a long time now. Kanna: Then let us continue keeping it hidden. We'll tell your friend that you can see butterflies, and that there are other people who can see them as well. Kanna: Once she becomes aware of that, she should come to stop relying on you alone. Kanna: The most important thing is that we keep the power of your eye a secret. In the past... Kanna: ...... Kanna: No, never mind. It would simply be easier on your future school life if nobody else knew you possessed special powers. Mei: Alright. So for now, I should try inviting her to come stop by the cafe? Kanna: Right. First, we'll have her come visit the cafe as a customer. Kanna: I'll leave it up to you to decide when to invite her. Of course, feel free to wait until after your exams are finished. Mei: Okay. Got it. Kanna: That's all I wanted to discuss. We're almost at your house, aren't we? Mei: Oh, yes. It's just up here. Kanna: Well, good luck with your exams. Mei: Thank you very much! Kanna: Have a good night. Mei: Goodnight! Mei: ...... Mei: She's right... It's about time we made up. Mei: Alright. Let's do this! "

Kanna: ...... Kanna: There is one other possibility that comes to mind. Kousei: What's that? Kanna: I may be wrong, of course... I was planning to tell you this after work. It's about her friend. Kanna: I asked her to bring her along to the cafe, as a customer. Kanna: If we could use the opportunity to forge a connection with her, it would give us an excuse to intervene in their situation, you see. Kousei: So you're saying... Mei might be having some trouble convincing her friend to come? Kanna: Yes. I told her her she could invite her friend whenever she wanted, but she may have tried to do it as soon as possible. Kousei: So she hasn't checked her phone because she's busy talking with her friend? Kanna: Perhaps it's in her bag, and that's why she hadn't noticed it ringing. Quite plausible, I'd say. Kousei: True... Well, as long as she's safe... Kanna: Let's try waiting a little bit longer. Kanna: If she's on her way to the cafe, she should be here soon. And if she isn't, she'll probably give us a call before long. Kousei: I guess you're right. But if she doesn't call us... Kanna: Then we would have to assume the situation is rather complicated. Kousei: If we wait for a while and she still doesn't come... would it be alright if I left work to look for her? Kanna: Of course. You can even leave now, if you want. At the very least, it's clear that something has happened to her. Kousei: I'd like to... but there could be any number of reasons she isn't answering her phone.

Kanna: Mei-san's? Kousei: I'm not the one who attracted these butterflies, but it was Mei who sent them to me... Kousei: This is a call for help! Kanna: Alright. Let's go. Kousei: If we follow these butterflies, they should lead us straight to her! Kanna: Mikado-san! Mikado: I know. I will cover the cafe in your absence. Kanna: Right behind you. Mei's Friend: ......

Mei's Friend: That's what I thought. Mei: W-Wait! Mei: Wait, please! Mei's Friend: You don't give up, do you? Mei: Please, just listen... I have something I want to tell you. I want you to come with me. Mei's Friend: So why do we have to go to the cafe where you work? Mei's Friend: Why can't you just tell me right here? Mei: Because there's someone I want you to meet... Mei's Friend: Let me guess: your boyfriend? Mei: Huh? Mei's Friend: I'm not interested in meeting him, so don't waste your time. Mei: W-Wait! It's not him. Mei's Friend: Then who? Mei: Someone who can help you. I know people who can solve all sorts of problems, so... Mei's Friend: What, did you join some sort of crazy cult? Mei: No, they're not some cult! I know they'll be able to help you! Mei: So please, meet with them! Mei's Friend: ...... Mei's Friend: It's a bit late for that, don't you think? Mei: Huh? Mei's Friend: You think this is funny? Mei: Wh-What? Mei's Friend: How many times have I asked you for help before? How many times have you ignored me? Mei: I never ignored you! Mei's Friend: Yes, you did. I begged you to cast your spell on me, but you refused. Mei: Yeah, because... Mei's Friend: All you had to do was hold my hand for a little while. Mei's Friend: Yet you couldn't care about me enough to even spare that tiny bit of effort, could you? Mei: That's not true! I couldn't do it because... well... Mei's Friend: Because what? Mei: Like I said before, I just didn't want you to start believing that you couldn't get back into shape without my spell... Mei's Friend: There you go, acting all condescending again... Mei: Wh-What? No, I'm not trying to... Mei's Friend: Enough. No matter what you have to say now, it all rings hollow. Mei's Friend: I thought you were one of my best friends, Mei... but I was wrong. Mei: That's not-- Mei's Friend: Not true?! It was just a stupid spell! Why couldn't you just do it for me?! Mei's Friend: All you had to do was cheer me on! Instead, all you gave me were condescending lectures! Mei's Friend: Then you went and quit the team too! When I needed your help the most, you just up and disappeared! Mei: I-I wasn't... Mei's Friend: I don't want to hear your excuses! I knew you didn't want me to rely on you. I knew I had to overcome this on my own! Mei's Friend: I knew that's why you quit the team! Mei's Friend: But just when I thought you might have felt bad about everything, I learned then you started working a job, and even found yourself a boyfriend! Mei's Friend: While I was suffering, all you were doing was enjoying yourself! I felt so stupid! Mei's Friend: You pretend to be kind, but run off when things get too hard for you to handle! I was nothing but a tool for you to satisfy your own ego! Mei: No... That's not... Mei's Friend: I told you, I don't want to hear your excuses. After you-- Mei's Friend: After you abandoned me! Mei: Ah! Mei's Friend: I don't know what your intentions were, but that, to me, is the truth. You abandoned me, Mei... Mei's Friend: I don't ever want to see your face again! Mei: ...... Mei: You're right... It's my fault for driving you into a corner... Mei: I shouldn't have thoughtlessly captured your wisps... Mei's Friend: Huh? Wisps? What are you talking about? Mei: I... I... Mei: Ngh... It hurts... Mei's Friend: Stop trying to play the victim. Mei: No, it's... ngh... my eye! Mei's Friend: Hold up. Are you seriously okay? Mei: No... Get away! What is this... Ngh! It's overflowing! Mei's Friend: What the... Why is a butterfly--? Mei: Agh... No, no, no! This isn't right... No! Mei's Friend: Mei? Mei: Nooooo! Kousei: Regardless of the state of these people's souls, either... Kanna: I'm afraid so... This, too, is the power of the eye. The power to bring sorrow. Kousei: We have to do something! Kanna: You look for Mei-san. I'll stay here and deal with these butterflies. Kanna: I can't just let them run amok. Kousei: Alright! Kousei: I'm looking for someone. Mei--you met her last time, didn't you? That girl from work... Hiroto: Your childhood friend? Kousei: No, the tanned one... Hiroto: Oh, yeah. I've seen her. Kousei: You have?! Hiroto: Of course I have. You probably don't know this, but I've been to the cafe more than a couple times before, as a customer. Hiroto: She's the waitress, right? I've seen her plenty of times before. Kousei: O-Oh, that's what you meant... Hiroto: I just saw her a second ago too. Kousei: You did?! Hiroto: Well, a little while ago, actually. Seemed like she was having a fight with her friend or something. They were arguing pretty loudly, which is why I noticed them. Kousei: Where were they?! Hiroto: They were that way. Arguing the whole time. Kousei: That way? Okay, thanks! You're a life-saver, Hiroto! Hiroto: S-Sure. I don't really know what's going on... but hope you find 'em. Kousei: Yeah! Seriously, thanks! Mei: *pant* *pant*... *pant* *pant*... Kousei: Hang in there, Mei! Mei: Ngh... Agh! Kousei: Mei! Mei: Kou-kun? Mei: It's all my fault... Mei's Friend: ...... Kousei: Can you hear me? Hey! Snap out of it! Mei: *pant*... *pant*... Mei: And all the butterflies I've ever caught... every last one of of them burst out of me... Kousei: You can tell me what happened afterwards. Kousei: Right now, we need to figure out what to do about all these butterflies. Mei: Right... Kousei: Do you think you could recapture them? Mei: ...... Mei: I'm sorry... I can't... No matter how long I stare at them, they won't disappear... Mei: And even if I could catch them... they'll just come out again... Mei: I'm sorry... It's all my fault... Kousei: Stop blaming yourself. Right now, I want you to think about me, and only me. Mei: Huh? Kousei: I was only able to find you because the butterflies guided me here. Kousei: The butterflies you released contained your emotions inside of them. Kousei: Through them, I could feel you reaching out for me. Calling for me. Kousei: That's how I was able to find you. Kousei: So I want you to do that again. Think about me like you did before. Kousei: If you do that, the butterflies should come flocking towards me once more. Kousei: And once they do... I'll take care of the rest. Mei: How? Kousei: You're not the only one with unusual powers, you know? Kousei: I'm not affected by the butterflies' negative influence, and I'm able to absorb them into my soul as well. Kousei: That's what my abilities are. Kousei: As long as you can get the butterflies to come to me, I'll be able to absorb them. So please, Mei. Kousei: Please think about me. As hard as you can. Mei: ...... Mei: What happens to you... once you absorb them? Mei: What? Kousei: The more butterflies I accumulate into my soul, the more powerful it becomes. Powerful enough to perform even miracles. But apparently, that violates God's divine laws. Kousei: So if I begin absorbing butterflies and become capable of performing miracles... God won't permit my existence. Kousei: In all likelihood, he'll try to erase me from this world. Mei: That's ridiculous... You can't do that! Mei: It's my fault that all of this happened! I can't let you die because of me, Kou-kun! Kousei: There's only one thing you can do, Mei! Mei: Ah! Kousei: At this rate, the power of your eye will only bring misery. Kousei: But that isn't how things ought to be. Your eye has the power to make people happy. Kousei: You're a girl who's always positive, always smiling, and always cheerful. Someone who brings joy to those around her. Kousei: Pull yourself together, Mei. This isn't who you are. Saying \"I can't\" and giving up isn't like you. Kousei: Shy, but proactive. Willing to give her all to help others. Kousei: That's the Mei I know. Kousei: That's the Mei I fell in love with! Mei: ...... Mei: Ngh! Kousei: I had to hold myself hostage to do it, though. Mei: If you hadn't gone that far, I would've kept wallowing in self-pity like an idiot. Mei: I'm not going to let you die, Kou-kun. And what's more-- Mei: I'm not going to cause her any more trouble. I'm going to save her! Kousei: Can you do it, Mei? Mei: I can! Kousei: Right. Inside each of those butterflies resides your feelings; a small piece of your heart. Kousei: Which means you should have some measure of control over them. That's why they sought me out in the first place. Kousei: Focus, and try to gather all the butterflies in one place. If you need a target to focus on, focus on me. Mei: Got it! Kousei: Just make sure you capture them before I end up absorbing them. Mei: I will! Mei: Answer me! Kousei: On it! Mei: I know! I can do this! Mei: Wisps! Butterflies! Just like always-- Mei: Come back to me! Kousei: Don't panic! I can handle a few! It's okay! Mei: But you'll die, Kou-kun! Kousei: It's okay. I've already died once. Mei: You wha--? Kousei: But I performed a miracle, and was able to rewind back time. Kousei: So don't worry. I'll just perform another miracle and come back. Kousei: I won't leave you alone, Mei. Everything will be alright. Focus on capturing those butterflies. Mei: How... How will that be alright?! Mei: Even if you've already died once, I won't let you die a second! Mei: I won't let you die because of me! Mei: I won't let you! Kousei: Ngh?! Mei: Come to me! Mei: No! I haven't caught them all yet! Kousei: You've already gotten most of them! That's enough! Stop! Mei: No! All of this is my fault! I brought this on myself! Mei: I don't care if I go blind-- Mei: I'm the one who has to finish this! Kousei: Stop it! Mei! Mei: Ahhhhhhh! Kanna: Phew. It looks like I narrowly made it in time. Kousei: Akizuki-san! Kousei: Mei! Mei: I-I'm okay... It stings a little... but I'm fine. Kousei: Phew... Thank goodness... Mei: But more importantly... Mei's Friend: Ugh... Mei's Friend: Huh? Ah... Mei: ...... Mei: I'm sorry. Everything was my fault... I'm so sorry. Mei's Friend: ...... Kanna: Can you stand? Mei's Friend: Ngh! Kanna: Ah-- Mei: I think you're right. I don't know if she was able to see them all along, or only because of me, though... Mei: ...... Mei: This time, she must hate me for sure. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Can you walk? Mei: Y-Yeah... Ah. I completely forgot about work... Kousei: Don't worry about that. I'll take you home. You need to rest for today. Mei: Ah... but if my mom finds me at home when she gets back, she's probably going to ask what happened... Kanna: In that case, why don't we go back to the cafe? We aren't going to make you work, of course. Kanna: Like Takamine-san said, you need to rest. Mei: Alright. Kousei: Let's go. Mei: Okay. "

            "Kanna: Oh dear! Were you hoping to see me in a maid uniform as well, Takamine-san? Kousei: That's not why I asked. Kanna: So you don't want to see me wear one? Kousei: I mean... I wouldn't say no. Kanna: Nihihi. That's what I thought. Kanna: But unfortunately, the plan is for me to work in the kitchen. I won't be appearing on the dining floor. Kousei: That's a shame. I bet it'd suit you really well. Kanna: Compliments won't get you anything. Except maybe a cup of coffee. Kanna: Here you are. Kousei: Thanks. Kousei: It's not bad. Hell, it's actually quite good. Kanna: Really? You don't have to be polite, you know. I want your honest opinion. Kousei: I am being honest. But... while it's definitely good, there's just nothing special... nothing unique about it. Kanna: I see... Kousei: Sorry. Maybe that's a poor choice of words. Kousei: I wouldn't have any complaints if I ordered this coffee. It's perfectly acceptable. Kanna: But what you're saying is, it's just a regular cup of coffee, right? Kousei: In a manner of speaking. Kanna: I guess I'll need to do some more research if I want to brew a better cup... Kousei: ...... Kousei: So is that the only reason you haven't been able to open for business yet? You can't tell if your coffee's any good? Natsume: We-- Woman: Hello, Natsume-chan. Woman: Would you please prepare a cup of blended coffee for me? Natsume: Certainly. I'll have it ready in a moment. Kousei: ...... Woman: Thank you. Now, let me have a taste. Natsume: What... do you think? Woman: ...... Woman: Natsume-chan... Perhaps this isn't going to work after all. Natsume: ...... Natsume: But... we still have some time before end of the month, don't we? Woman: Yes, but... Natsume: Please, give me a little longer. I promise I'll deliver next time. If you truly think there's no hope by then... I'll give up... Woman: ...... Woman: Alright. A promise is a promise. Try not to push yourself too hard, dear. Natsume: I won't. Thank you. Woman: I'll stop by again soon. Natsume: Of course. We'll be waiting. Kanna: I know. Kousei: Sorry, I'm not sure I do. Natsume: That woman here just now was our landlady. We need her approval in order to open the cafe. Natsume: She agreed to give us approval if we managed to satisfy her as a customer, but... Kousei: It's not going too well, huh? Natsume: She's already visited us several times, but... we just can't seem to meet her standards. Natsume: That's why we needed the help of someone who knows what good coffee tastes like. So we can improve our blend. Kousei: You mentioned something about the end of the month too... Natsume: We've only been allowed to rent this place temporarily, you see. Although our initial agreement was set to expire in the summer, we managed convince her to give us until October, but... Kousei: Still no luck. Natsume: Unfortunately not. Natsume: I think I need to take a break for a bit. Is that alright? Kanna: Ah--yes, of course. Natsume: Thanks. I'll leave the rest to you. Kousei: ...... Kanna: You could say that. Right now, she's on the verge of giving up on something very important herself. At this rate-- Kousei: Her soul will end up lingering the world of the living? Kanna: It's possible, yes. But if we can manage to open this cafe, we might just be able to prevent that. Kousei: She didn't seem particularly supportive, though. Kanna: I wouldn't say she's been unkind to us either. Kousei: Well at any rate, the point is that she isn't satisfied as a customer, right? Kousei: Does she only have a problem with the coffee? What about the other menu items? Kanna: We did have her try our omelet rice one time. Mikado: And our black tea, as well. Kousei: Omelet rice and black tea, huh... Kousei: I'd like to see how those taste too, if that's okay. Would you mind? Mikado: Kanna can prepare the omelet rice for you, but Natsume was the one who made the tea. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Incidentally, what exactly is your job going to be? Mikado: I will be charge of making drinks. I'm already proficient in brewing both coffee and tea. Kousei: I-I see... Kanna: Of course. Leave it to me. Kanna: Please watch over things while I whip up a prototype, Mikado-san. Mikado: Understood. Kanna: Come, Takamine-san. Let's head over to the kitchen, shall we? Kanna: Now then, let's get started. Kanna: We'll need a couple eggs, an onion, some chicken... Kanna: I told you I had a lot of practice. Did you not believe me? Kousei: That's not it, but... Kousei: Do Grim Reapers even need to eat food like regular people to survive? Kanna: It is possible for us to survive without eating, since we're sustained by the power of God. Kanna: But survival isn't everything. If we didn't eat, our souls would weaken... and our physical health would suffer as well. Kousei: Huh. I see. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Was I scowling or something? Sorry. I didn't mean to. Kanna: No, no. I didn't mean it like that. Kanna: It just feels like all my cooking skills are being put to the test... That's why it's a little scary. Kousei: No pressure. This is all just practice too. Kanna: I suppose you're right... Kanna: Here you are! The results of hours upon hours of omelet rice practice! Kousei: Wow, it came out beautifully. This is some restaurant-level quality. Kousei: Actually, I prefer my ketchup spread evenly over the egg... Kanna: Ahh?! What about all my hard work?! Kousei: It's great. Kanna: You really mean it? Kousei: There wouldn't be any point in complimenting you for the sake of it. My life depends on how many customers we can attract, after all. Kousei: It tastes great. It's hard to put into words, but... it has a really gentle flavor. Like a lot of care was put into making it. Kanna: You think so? Well I'm glad you like it. Kousei: I'd have no problems paying for something like this. Omelet rice might be a personal favorite of mine, but I'd definitely order this again sometime. Kousei: It wouldn't even be surprised if it becomes our signature dish. Kanna: ...... Kanna: I'm... very happy to hear you say that. Very, very happy. Kousei: ...... Kousei: There's no need to look that flattered. Kanna: *giggle* Don't say that. A real man has to take responsibility for the compliments he gives. Kousei: Still, I'm only giving you my amateur opinion. I can't guarantee this'll actually sell well. Kanna: But you weren't lying just to spare my feelings, were you? Kousei: No. I really would love to eat this again sometime. Kanna: That's good to hear. Kousei: You must have had to practice a lot to make something this delicious, huh? Kanna: Yes, you could say that... It definitely wasn't easy. Kanna: But that's why it makes me so happy to hear how much you enjoyed it. Kanna: Really... really happy... "

Yamagoshi: Aww, you still remember me! Natsume: Of course... It's... been so long... Kumagaya: Wow! This cafe is the real deal, huh? Washio: You look great in that outfit too. Reminds me of that old drawing of yours! Natsume: Wait, hold up. What is this? What's happening? Why are all of you here? Somei: I told you, it's a reunion. Somei: But if you want the full story, try asking your boyfriend over there. Ooyami: Damn, she's already taken? Kinugasa: Well, what did you expect? Somei: He's the one who crafted this entire plan. Kousei: You make it sound like some kind of evil plot. Natsume: Excuse you? Kousei: Wait. Please stop glaring at me like that. Mikado: Calm yourself. We'll explain everything once you've shown our guests to their seats. Kousei: Y-Yeah. Come on, smile! Smile for the customers! Natsume: Tsk... "

Suzune: I'm flattered, but I doubt anyone's waiting in line for us to open. We're not offering any limited-time promotions or anything. Suzune: I'm hoping we get a lot of customers too, but let's not bite off more than we can chew. Suzune: No matter how much we've practiced things, the real deal won't be the same. Kousei: Still, we've reached over 500 followers on Instogram now, so I'd say we've garnered some attention. Mikado: Is that high? Kousei: Well, Hiuchidani-san said it was pretty amazing. It has only been less than a month since we started, and we've only just opened. Mikado: I see. In that case, perhaps we can raise our expectations a little. Kousei: Apparently, our follow count experienced a sudden surge these past few days. Kousei: All thanks to those pictures of you we posted, I'm sure. Mikado: Y-You don't say? Heh. I must say, I did not expect so many people to appreciate my sophistication. Suzune: Even so, our followers could be from anywhere around the globe. There's no guaranteeing they all live in the area. Suzune: If you get yourself too excited, you're just asking to be let down. Kousei: Not very optimistic, are you? Suzune: Ah, sorry. I didn't mean to be a wet blanket. Suzune: I just know how cruel reality can be from personal experience, so I guess I've gotten into the habit of thinking pragmatically. Sorry. Natsume: You don't have to apologize for that. You made a valid point. Natsume: Reality can certainly be unforgiving. But that's why we need to be focused on putting a smile on the face of everyone who walks through our door! Natsume: Once we can do that, people will be lining up outside our cafe in no time at all. Suzune: Yeah, that's exactly what I was trying to say! Kousei: Feels like you're just piggybacking on what she said, though. Suzune: Look, I'm just trying to pep everyone up! Mikado: In any case, both Sumizome-kun and Hiuchidani-kun have classes all morning, so we will be somewhat short-staffed for the time being. Best to keep that in mind. Kousei: Right. The last thing we want to do is inconvenience our customers. Mikado: It is approaching ten now, is it not? Kanna: I'll go flip the door sign to \"Open.\" Natsume: Ah--let me do that. I want to be the one to open the cafe today. Kanna: Of course. By all means. Natsume: *sigh*... We're really open. The day's finally here. Natsume: No, now's not the time to be getting sentimental. This is where the real challenge begins. Let's do this. ???: Finally open, are you? Natsume: Yes! Please, come in! Natsume: We have a customer! Kanna & Suzune & Kousei: Welcome to Cafe Stella! Kazufumi: Oh, it definitely has gotten brighter in here. Both the place and the people. Kazufumi: Hey, guys! I'm here for the big day. Kousei: Welcome. Please, have a seat. Kazufumi: Thanks.

Hiroto: I know it's not my place to be making a big fuss about this, but still... Kousei: Let me ask you something first, Nonaka-kun. Kousei: Is this girl you like a friend of yours? Or is she some stranger you fell in love with at first sight? Nonaka: She's in the same major as I am, so it's not like she's a total stranger... Nonaka: But she probably doesn't remember me. As you can probably tell, I'm a pretty forgettable person... Kousei: What kind of girl is she? Hiroto: Her name's Kumagai Rina... The one with the long black hair in this picture. Hiroto: In fact, I heard nothing but good things the more I asked around about her. She's always smiling, always considerate, and everyone who knows her adores her. Kousei: You'd think a girl like her would be pretty popular with other guys. Hiroto: She definitely is. I almost fell for her myself just from hearing other people talk about her. Kousei: Come on, man. Don't say that. Kousei: Nonaka-kun's standing right there. Nonaka: What?! Oh, no, I don't really mind... Hiroto: I said \"almost,\" you dumbass! I didn't ACTUALLY fall in love with her. She's not really my type anyway. I like more stylish girls. Hiroto: But that's besides the point. Anyway, she's a nice girl, and luckily, she doesn't seem to have a boyfriend right now either. Kousei: In that case-- Hiroto: You have a chance, man. That's what I've been trying to tell you too. Nonaka: There's no way she'd choose a guy like me. Hiroto: Yeah, not with that attitude. Mikado: If there is a female he's attracted to, why not try to court her? And she has no mate either, from what you say. Kousei: Yeah, but the thought of being rejected is still scary. Mikado: I cannot understand. Kousei: Well, you're a cat. It's different for you. Natsume: Hmm... I don't think people and cats are all that different. Does it not have more to do with the fact that he lacks confidence because he's never experienced success before? Mikado: Do you think so? Mikado: Well, either way, it is likely that he'll slip further and further into depression if we leave him alone. Kanna: Right. We have to do something. Kousei: If I invited him to the cafe, would you be able to do something for him? Mikado: Perhaps... but you are not exactly close friends with this person, are you? Mikado: If so, it would seem less suspicious if we were the ones to go to him. Kousei: So... you're saying I should take Akizuki-san to college with me? Kanna: Me? I mean, I would be willing to, but there's just one problem... I'm not a student there. Natsume: Universities aren't that strict. Technically, entrance is supposed to be restricted to only students and staff, but you're allowed on campus as long as you have some reason to be there. Natsume: People from the neighborhood come to eat in the cafeteria all the time, for example. Kanna: Oh, really? I had no idea. Kanna: Alright then. I'll pay your school a visit tomorrow. Kousei: Great. Suzune: You don't have to come in on weekdays, you know. Ah--though I do still want your help in the mornings. Kousei: Don't worry. I actually enjoy working quite a bit. Suzune: You've got a bright future as a corporate slave, I'll tell you that much. Kousei: Damn right. I'm second to none when it comes to taking orders from other people. Kousei: Still, I gotta graduate first, so I'm off to class. Suzune: See ya. Kousei: Akizuki-san. I'm gonna head to school now. Kanna: Okay. I'll be there around 4:30.

Kousei: Or better yet, she might even be willing to be reincarnated once we get rid of whatever lingering regrets she has. Mikado: ...... Mikado: There is something you must know, Takamine Kousei. We will only be able to converse with that butterfly one final time. Kousei: Huh? Why? Mikado: God has given us new orders. Mikado: We only have one more chance. If that fails... Kousei: ...... Kanna: A deadline has also been set. We have until 11:59:59 PM next Sunday. Mikado: The talisman's protection should be expiring right around then as well. Mikado: However, you and Nozomi must be together 24 hours a day for the talisman to protect you. Mikado: If we wait any longer, her parents will return, and you will not have an excuse to live together anymore. Kousei: So you're saying Sunday is our deadline regardless? Kousei: Then this really is our last chance to talk to the red butterfly. Kousei: Still, if we can give her whatever it is she's waiting for by Sunday night, we just might make it. Mikado: I think you're being rather optimistic. Mikado: If she refuses to talk to us again, it is all over. Kousei: That may be true, but we're doing this to help the red butterfly. Kousei: Why wouldn't she want to talk to us? Kanna: But if that's the case, why didn't she give us a clear answer last night? Mikado: There must be a reason she cannot, or will not, say. Kanna: And if so, we're not likely to get a different answer even if we speak to her again tonight. Kousei: If anything, we'd just be wasting our final chance, I guess... Mikado: Precisely. Kousei: Well, not just her. I do too. Mikado: You want to help it even though it has endangered you twice now? Kousei: Nozomi, at the very least, doesn't think those accidents were the red butterfly's doing. Kousei: She says she hasn't been getting any of her usual heebie-jeebies. Kousei: That's why we didn't realize that the red butterfly was haunting us until a while after the new year. Kousei: But her sixth sense is telling her it has no evil intentions. Kanna: To be honest, I also get the feeling that the red butterfly isn't a bad person. Kousei: So do I. Mikado: We mustn't let our emotions get the better of us. Mikado: If she does, in fact, mean Nozomi no harm--what reason could she have to haunt her? Kousei: That's the million dollar question.

Kousei: I mean, it's used frequently enough these days that it's basically Japanese. Natsume: In short, it refers to sites such as Facehook or Instogram, which allow you to communicate with people all over the world. Natsume: Do you ever see people fiddling with their smartphones while they're walking down the street? They're probably browsing their social media feed.

I know about local BBS systems, at least... Natsume: Huh? I'm confused now... What is a BBS? Kousei: Surely you know what the internet is if you know what BBS systems are. Mikado: It has never been necessary for Grim Reapers to communicate with the world at large. Mikado: They possess neither cellphones nor smartphones of any kind.

Natsume: I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but, umm... Natsume: If you don't even know what a smartphone is, did you even understand a word of our conversation earlier? Kanna: W-Well, more or less. Kanna: Basically, you were talking about using pictures of pancakes, strawberries, and cats to attract customers to our store, right? Kousei: That's the idea. Natsume: Speaking of cats... Mikado: Absolutely not. Kanna: Aww. Natsume: You didn't even let me finish. Mikado: I know what you were going to say. You wish to parade me around to our customers like some sort of... poster cat, don't you? Mikado: I refuse! I am a nobleman. I carry with me the pride of the Cat Sidhe.

Mikado: What?! H-How dare you, you scoundrel! Kousei: I can't believe a threat like that actually worked... Mikado: You do not understand the agony of eating dry kibble every single day, Takamine Kousei! Kousei: Well, yeah. I've never tried it. Kanna: Still, we've got a lot of work to do before we even get to asking His Excellency for help. Kousei: Actually, I've been thinking: why don't we hire another worker? Kousei: Of course, we'll have to warn them that there's a chance we won't ever open for business, but still... Natsume: Can we not handle this on our own? Kousei: Unlikely. You and I both have school, and our kitchen is understaffed as it is. Kousei: If we wanted to manage with just the four of us, we'd never be able to take time off. Natsume: Right... Kanna: Why don't we try putting up a few help-wanted posters and see what happens? Kanna: Oh, and before we forget--the pancakes. Natsume: I'll bet we can find plenty of recipes online. Kousei: We'll have to put our own spin on it, though. Especially if we want to make it our main item. Kousei: But to do that, we might want to consult someone with a decent amount of cooking experience. Natsume: ...... Kousei: Hmm... Nozomi: You don't often come all the way out here, though. Is it something urgent? Kousei: ...... Nozomi: Earth to Kousei-kun? Kousei: Oh, sorry. You just look so pretty. Nozomi: ...... Kousei: It's been a while since I've seen you in your miko outfit... I can't stop myself from staring. Kousei: Were you always this cute? Also--is it just me, or has your hair grown longer? Nozomi: O-Oh, yeah. They're just extensions. I thought I'd give long hair a try. What do you think? Kousei: Hmm. I like it. You look really cute with long hair. Nozomi: Aww, thanks. Ehehe. Nozomi: So--what are you after? Kousei: What do you mean? Nozomi: You're up to something. I can smell it. Kousei: How? I'm just complimenting your outfit... Nozomi: That's exactly what's so suspicious. Honestly, your compliments aren't even flattering. Kousei: Why not? Nozomi: You make it sound like I'm wearing a cosplay or something. It's embarrassing. Kousei: Why go through the effort of wearing hair extensions then? Nozomi: The tourists who visit the shrine like to take pictures of me in my shrine maiden outfit. I'm not complaining, though--they're always polite about it. Nozomi: I just wanna look good if I'm gonna have my picture taken. You know what I mean? Kousei: Guess I'm not the only one who thinks you're cute. All those tourists seem to think so too. Nozomi: I knew it. You're DEFINITELY up to no good, you creep. Kousei: Well, I want something, but it's nothing bad... Nozomi: See?! What did I say! Kousei: Look, just let me explain before you jump to conclusions! Nozomi: *sigh*... Can I put my broom away first, at least? Kousei: So in short, we're looking for someone who knows how to make pancakes. Kousei: And I was thinking you might be able to help. Nozomi: I've never made pancakes before. Kousei: Never? Nozomi: To me, pancakes are best enjoyed when someone else makes them for me. Nozomi: I mean, I could make them if I really wanted to... but I'd be so focused on making it perfect that it'd probably be an awful experience. Kousei: Oh... Kousei: Let me ask you this then: do you ever go to cafes and order pancakes? Nozomi: Not by myself, but I sometimes go with my friends on weekends. Nozomi: Sometimes it's just a quick stop while we're out, and sometimes we specifically go out to a fancy restaurant. Either way, they're always super delicious! Kousei: Well, if you go to fancy restaurants, surely you know how to make a good pancake, no? Nozomi: By that logic, anyone can be a good voice actor just by watching anime. Kousei: Touche... Kousei: Still, though, I'm sure anything you make would taste amazing. Nozomi: That's not very convincing coming from the person who always shovels down my cooking in complete and utter silence. Kousei: Only because it's so delicious. Nozomi: Well, I appreciate the kind words, even if you're just sweet-talking me... but I'm still not too confident it'd work out. Kousei: I'm not sweet-talking you; I'm serious. Nozomi: Well, the thing is... cooking and baking are two completely different disciplines. Nozomi: When cooking, you can usually get away with measuring things by eye, but with baking, every ingredient needs to be precisely the exact amount, or else it won't turn out right. Nozomi: It might not rise properly, or it might not harden enough. Or the surface might end up cracking. It's more like doing chemistry than anything. Nozomi: I wouldn't mind baking for you personally, Kousei-kun... but if this is something that's going to be sold at a restaurant, you're better off finding someone who knows what they're doing. Kousei: Ah... Well, if it's not that easy, I guess that's for the best. Nozomi: Hmm, do you need help with anything else? Nozomi: I'd be happy to do anything that's not the pancake-making. Or is that a prerequisite for the job? Kousei: Oh, you seem pretty interested? Nozomi: Well, I've always wanted to try working at a cafe! I'd love to give it a shot, if you'll have me. Nozomi: What? You don't seem too thrilled about the idea of me working there. Kousei: That's not true! Cute, cheerful, AND a great cook? Wow! We'd love to have you! Nozomi: You're obviously just messing with me. Kousei: We'd greatly benefit from you working there. You could lend us a hand in the kitchen when things get busy, right? Nozomi: Well, sure. As long as I have all the recipes. Kousei: Perfect. Kousei: But I should warn you, there's no guarantee we'll actually open for business. Kousei: Actually, before we get into anything... What about your shrine maiden work? Will it not be hard for you to juggle two jobs? Nozomi: I'm sure I can figure something out with my dad. Nozomi: Besides, I only work here 'cause I'm in the family. Did you know? I don't even get paid to do this. And my allowance isn't anything to brag about, either. Kousei: Well, your old man's not exactly rich. Nozomi: All the more reason for me to get my own job then. Girls my age need money. Kousei: Alright. I can't hire you on the spot, but I'll talk to my coworkers about it as soon as I can. Nozomi: Thanks! I really appreciate it. Nozomi: Just, uh... keep in mind that I've never had a real job before, so it might take me a while to get the hang of things. Kousei: That's fine. Kousei: I know you'll do great, Nozomi. I believe in you. Nozomi: ...... Nozomi: You know, Kousei-kun. I think you might be a natural-born gigolo. Kousei: What, because all I do is rely on others. Nozomi: No, 'cause you're good at buttering people up. Kousei: You think so? Nozomi: It's true. Kousei: Hmm... Well, I guess I better work on improving my domestic skills. Nozomi: If you're worried about your future, I suggest you look for a real job instead. Kousei: Hey, taking care of the house is a legitimate job. Nozomi: Ugh... This guy's actually considering becoming a gigolo. What a creep. Kousei: You know, that term doesn't sit right with me. I'd much rather be called a house-husband, or a stay-at-home dad. Nozomi: Now you're just arguing semantics. Whatever gave you that silly idea in the first place? Kousei: Don't worry about it. Anyway, are there any cafes in the area that you'd recommend? Nozomi: Cafes? Hmm... If you're looking for a place within walking distance... Wait, why do you ask? Kousei: While we were talking about you joining us, I realized something. Kousei: I've never actually been to a real fancy cafe before. Kousei: So I figure I should at least go and experience one for myself. Also, it should be a place that's popular among girls your age, if possible. Nozomi: Okay. Well, if that's what you're looking for... I just so happen to know a great place that sells pancakes a couple of stations from here. Kousei: Great. Kousei: Are you free after this? Nozomi: I've finished sweeping, so I'm free to go home once I change out of these clothes. Kousei: Wanna go there with me then? I'm kinda scared to go to one of those fancy places alone. Nozomi: Don't brazenly admit how much of a wimp you are. Kousei: Come on, please? I can't walk into a cafe full of girls by myself. Nozomi: *sigh*... Oh, alright. But you're paying. Kousei: Sure. Nozomi: Great! Wait one sec while I go get changed! Cafe Worker: Welcome! Party of two? Kousei: Yeah. Cafe Worker: Please follow me! Nozomi: Oh my God, it's SO hard to decide! Look, doesn't all of this stuff sound super delicious? Kousei: Hmm... I'll go with the basic pancakes. And a blend coffee. Nozomi: Alright... I think I'll go with the strawberry-chocolate pancake! Kousei: You love strawberries, don't you? Nozomi: Huh? Well, yeah. Both the tart autumn ones, and the sweeter variety they harvest in the winter! Kousei: Hmm. I guess my dad was right on the money with the strawberry thing. Nozomi: What is this? Kousei: Ah, nothing. Cafe Worker: Are you ready to order? Nozomi: Yes. I'll have the strawberry-chocolate pancakes, and an Assam tea. And for him, the regular pancakes and a blended coffee. Oh, and with butter, please! Cafe Worker: Alright. I'll have your food out to you in just a moment. "

            "Kousei: Oh, right. It stands for Social Networking System, I think? Natsume: Isn't it Social Networking Service? Kanna: Hmm... Kanna: Ah! Social Networking Service, huh? I get that! Natsume: You have no idea what that is, do you? Kanna: How am I supposed to? You used way too many English words! My area of expertise is Japan only! Kousei: I mean, it's used frequently enough these days that it's basically Japanese. Natsume: In short, it refers to sites such as Facehook or Instogram, which allow you to communicate with people all over the world. Natsume: Do you ever see people fiddling with their smartphones while they're walking down the street? They're probably browsing their social media feed. Kanna: There you go again, using all these obscure words. What the heck is a smart phone? Natsume & Kousei: What? Kousei: You don't even know what a smartphone is? Natsume: Have you never used a mobile phone? Kanna: O-Of course I have! Um, the really heavy thing you put on your shoulder, right? And when you answer, you're like, \"Hullooo.\" Kousei: A brick phone? Kanna: Yeah, that's the one. Changing the subject--on the topic of new menu items, what do you think about tiramisu? Kousei: Wait, a brick phone? One of THOSE ancient things?! Natsume: I can't believe I'm asking this... but you DO know what the internet is, don't you? Kanna: The inter... net, you said? I know about local BBS systems, at least... Natsume: Huh? I'm confused now... What is a BBS? Kousei: Surely you know what the internet is if you know what BBS systems are. Mikado: It has never been necessary for Grim Reapers to communicate with the world at large. Mikado: They possess neither cellphones nor smartphones of any kind. Natsume: People like that actually exist in this day and age? Kanna: I-It's not my fault! Society evolves too quick for me! Kanna: Enough about me already! We were discussing the cafe, weren't we?! Natsume: I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but, umm... Natsume: If you don't even know what a smartphone is, did you even understand a word of our conversation earlier? Kanna: W-Well, more or less. Kanna: Basically, you were talking about using pictures of pancakes, strawberries, and cats to attract customers to our store, right? Kousei: That's the idea. Natsume: Speaking of cats... Mikado: Absolutely not. Kanna: Aww. Natsume: You didn't even let me finish. Mikado: I know what you were going to say. You wish to parade me around to our customers like some sort of... poster cat, don't you? Mikado: I refuse! I am a nobleman. I carry with me the pride of the Cat Sidhe. Mikado: I will not stoop so low as to toady myself to the likes of a mere human. Natsume: Pretty please? Mikado: Absolutely not. Natsume: I'll only feed you dry kibble for dinner from now on. Mikado: What?! H-How dare you, you scoundrel! Kousei: I can't believe a threat like that actually worked... Mikado: You do not understand the agony of eating dry kibble every single day, Takamine Kousei! Kousei: Well, yeah. I've never tried it. Kanna: Still, we've got a lot of work to do before we even get to asking His Excellency for help. Kousei: Actually, I've been thinking: why don't we hire another worker? Kousei: Of course, we'll have to warn them that there's a chance we won't ever open for business, but still... Natsume: Can we not handle this on our own? Kousei: Unlikely. You and I both have school, and our kitchen is understaffed as it is. Kousei: If we wanted to manage with just the four of us, we'd never be able to take time off. Natsume: Right... Kanna: Why don't we try putting up a few help-wanted posters and see what happens? Kanna: Oh, and before we forget--the pancakes. Natsume: I'll bet we can find plenty of recipes online. Kousei: We'll have to put our own spin on it, though. Especially if we want to make it our main item. Kousei: But to do that, we might want to consult someone with a decent amount of cooking experience. Natsume: ...... Kousei: Hmm... Nozomi: You don't often come all the way out here, though. Is it something urgent? Kousei: ...... Nozomi: Earth to Kousei-kun? Kousei: Oh, sorry. You just look so pretty. Nozomi: ...... Kousei: It's been a while since I've seen you in your miko outfit... I can't stop myself from staring. Kousei: Were you always this cute? Also--is it just me, or has your hair grown longer? Nozomi: O-Oh, yeah. They're just extensions. I thought I'd give long hair a try. What do you think? Kousei: Hmm. I like it. You look really cute with long hair. Nozomi: Aww, thanks. Ehehe. Nozomi: So--what are you after? Kousei: What do you mean? Nozomi: You're up to something. I can smell it. Kousei: How? I'm just complimenting your outfit... Nozomi: That's exactly what's so suspicious. Honestly, your compliments aren't even flattering. Kousei: Why not? Nozomi: You make it sound like I'm wearing a cosplay or something. It's embarrassing. Kousei: Why go through the effort of wearing hair extensions then? Nozomi: The tourists who visit the shrine like to take pictures of me in my shrine maiden outfit. I'm not complaining, though--they're always polite about it. Nozomi: I just wanna look good if I'm gonna have my picture taken. You know what I mean? Kousei: Guess I'm not the only one who thinks you're cute. All those tourists seem to think so too. Nozomi: I knew it. You're DEFINITELY up to no good, you creep. Kousei: Well, I want something, but it's nothing bad... Nozomi: See?! What did I say! Kousei: Look, just let me explain before you jump to conclusions! Nozomi: *sigh*... Can I put my broom away first, at least? Kousei: So in short, we're looking for someone who knows how to make pancakes. Kousei: And I was thinking you might be able to help. Nozomi: I've never made pancakes before. Kousei: Never? Nozomi: To me, pancakes are best enjoyed when someone else makes them for me. Nozomi: I mean, I could make them if I really wanted to... but I'd be so focused on making it perfect that it'd probably be an awful experience. Kousei: Oh... Kousei: Let me ask you this then: do you ever go to cafes and order pancakes? Nozomi: Not by myself, but I sometimes go with my friends on weekends. Nozomi: Sometimes it's just a quick stop while we're out, and sometimes we specifically go out to a fancy restaurant. Either way, they're always super delicious! Kousei: Well, if you go to fancy restaurants, surely you know how to make a good pancake, no? Nozomi: By that logic, anyone can be a good voice actor just by watching anime. Kousei: Touche... Kousei: Still, though, I'm sure anything you make would taste amazing. Nozomi: That's not very convincing coming from the person who always shovels down my cooking in complete and utter silence. Kousei: Only because it's so delicious. Nozomi: Well, I appreciate the kind words, even if you're just sweet-talking me... but I'm still not too confident it'd work out. Kousei: I'm not sweet-talking you; I'm serious. Nozomi: Well, the thing is... cooking and baking are two completely different disciplines. Nozomi: When cooking, you can usually get away with measuring things by eye, but with baking, every ingredient needs to be precisely the exact amount, or else it won't turn out right. Nozomi: It might not rise properly, or it might not harden enough. Or the surface might end up cracking. It's more like doing chemistry than anything. Nozomi: I wouldn't mind baking for you personally, Kousei-kun... but if this is something that's going to be sold at a restaurant, you're better off finding someone who knows what they're doing. Kousei: Ah... Well, if it's not that easy, I guess that's for the best. Nozomi: Hmm, do you need help with anything else? Nozomi: I'd be happy to do anything that's not the pancake-making. Or is that a prerequisite for the job? Kousei: Oh, you seem pretty interested? Nozomi: Well, I've always wanted to try working at a cafe! I'd love to give it a shot, if you'll have me. Nozomi: What? You don't seem too thrilled about the idea of me working there. Kousei: That's not true! Cute, cheerful, AND a great cook? Wow! We'd love to have you! Nozomi: You're obviously just messing with me. Kousei: We'd greatly benefit from you working there. You could lend us a hand in the kitchen when things get busy, right? Nozomi: Well, sure. As long as I have all the recipes. Kousei: Perfect. Kousei: But I should warn you, there's no guarantee we'll actually open for business. Kousei: Actually, before we get into anything... What about your shrine maiden work? Will it not be hard for you to juggle two jobs? Nozomi: I'm sure I can figure something out with my dad. Nozomi: Besides, I only work here 'cause I'm in the family. Did you know? I don't even get paid to do this. And my allowance isn't anything to brag about, either. Kousei: Well, your old man's not exactly rich. Nozomi: All the more reason for me to get my own job then. Girls my age need money. Kousei: Alright. I can't hire you on the spot, but I'll talk to my coworkers about it as soon as I can. Nozomi: Thanks! I really appreciate it. Nozomi: Just, uh... keep in mind that I've never had a real job before, so it might take me a while to get the hang of things. Kousei: That's fine. Kousei: I know you'll do great, Nozomi. I believe in you. Nozomi: ...... Nozomi: You know, Kousei-kun. I think you might be a natural-born gigolo. Kousei: What, because all I do is rely on others. Nozomi: No, 'cause you're good at buttering people up. Kousei: You think so? Nozomi: It's true. Kousei: Hmm... Well, I guess I better work on improving my domestic skills. Nozomi: If you're worried about your future, I suggest you look for a real job instead. Kousei: Hey, taking care of the house is a legitimate job. Nozomi: Ugh... This guy's actually considering becoming a gigolo. What a creep. Kousei: You know, that term doesn't sit right with me. I'd much rather be called a house-husband, or a stay-at-home dad. Nozomi: Now you're just arguing semantics. Whatever gave you that silly idea in the first place? Kousei: Don't worry about it. Anyway, are there any cafes in the area that you'd recommend? Nozomi: Cafes? Hmm... If you're looking for a place within walking distance... Wait, why do you ask? Kousei: While we were talking about you joining us, I realized something. Kousei: I've never actually been to a real fancy cafe before. Kousei: So I figure I should at least go and experience one for myself. Also, it should be a place that's popular among girls your age, if possible. Nozomi: Okay. Well, if that's what you're looking for... I just so happen to know a great place that sells pancakes a couple of stations from here. Kousei: Great. Kousei: Are you free after this? Nozomi: I've finished sweeping, so I'm free to go home once I change out of these clothes. Kousei: Wanna go there with me then? I'm kinda scared to go to one of those fancy places alone. Nozomi: Don't brazenly admit how much of a wimp you are. Kousei: Come on, please? I can't walk into a cafe full of girls by myself. Nozomi: *sigh*... Oh, alright. But you're paying. Kousei: Sure. Nozomi: Great! Wait one sec while I go get changed! Cafe Worker: Welcome! Party of two? Kousei: Yeah. Cafe Worker: Please follow me! Nozomi: Oh my God, it's SO hard to decide! Look, doesn't all of this stuff sound super delicious? Kousei: Hmm... I'll go with the basic pancakes. And a blend coffee. Nozomi: Alright... I think I'll go with the strawberry-chocolate pancake!

Kousei: Why go through the effort of wearing hair extensions then? Nozomi: The tourists who visit the shrine like to take pictures of me in my shrine maiden outfit. I'm not complaining, though--they're always polite about it. Nozomi: I just wanna look good if I'm gonna have my picture taken. You know what I mean? Kousei: Guess I'm not the only one who thinks you're cute. All those tourists seem to think so too. Nozomi: I knew it. You're DEFINITELY up to no good, you creep. Kousei: Well, I want something, but it's nothing bad... Nozomi: See?! What did I say! Kousei: Look, just let me explain before you jump to conclusions! Nozomi: *sigh*... Can I put my broom away first, at least? Kousei: So in short, we're looking for someone who knows how to make pancakes. Kousei: And I was thinking you might be able to help. Nozomi: I've never made pancakes before. Kousei: Never? Nozomi: To me, pancakes are best enjoyed when someone else makes them for me. Nozomi: I mean, I could make them if I really wanted to... but I'd be so focused on making it perfect that it'd probably be an awful experience. Kousei: Oh... Kousei: Let me ask you this then: do you ever go to cafes and order pancakes? Nozomi: Not by myself, but I sometimes go with my friends on weekends. Nozomi: Sometimes it's just a quick stop while we're out, and sometimes we specifically go out to a fancy restaurant. Either way, they're always super delicious! Kousei: Well, if you go to fancy restaurants, surely you know how to make a good pancake, no? Nozomi: By that logic, anyone can be a good voice actor just by watching anime. Kousei: Touche... Kousei: Still, though, I'm sure anything you make would taste amazing. Nozomi: That's not very convincing coming from the person who always shovels down my cooking in complete and utter silence. Kousei: Only because it's so delicious. Nozomi: Well, I appreciate the kind words, even if you're just sweet-talking me... but I'm still not too confident it'd work out. Kousei: I'm not sweet-talking you; I'm serious. Nozomi: Well, the thing is... cooking and baking are two completely different disciplines. Nozomi: When cooking, you can usually get away with measuring things by eye, but with baking, every ingredient needs to be precisely the exact amount, or else it won't turn out right. Nozomi: It might not rise properly, or it might not harden enough. Or the surface might end up cracking. It's more like doing chemistry than anything. Nozomi: I wouldn't mind baking for you personally, Kousei-kun... but if this is something that's going to be sold at a restaurant, you're better off finding someone who knows what they're doing. Kousei: Ah... Well, if it's not that easy, I guess that's for the best. Nozomi: Hmm, do you need help with anything else? Nozomi: I'd be happy to do anything that's not the pancake-making. Or is that a prerequisite for the job? Kousei: Oh, you seem pretty interested? Nozomi: Well, I've always wanted to try working at a cafe! I'd love to give it a shot, if you'll have me. Nozomi: What? You don't seem too thrilled about the idea of me working there. Kousei: That's not true! Cute, cheerful, AND a great cook? Wow! We'd love to have you! Nozomi: You're obviously just messing with me. Kousei: We'd greatly benefit from you working there. You could lend us a hand in the kitchen when things get busy, right? Nozomi: Well, sure. As long as I have all the recipes. Kousei: Perfect. Kousei: But I should warn you, there's no guarantee we'll actually open for business. Kousei: Actually, before we get into anything... What about your shrine maiden work? Will it not be hard for you to juggle two jobs? Nozomi: I'm sure I can figure something out with my dad. Nozomi: Besides, I only work here 'cause I'm in the family. Did you know? I don't even get paid to do this. And my allowance isn't anything to brag about, either. Kousei: Well, your old man's not exactly rich. Nozomi: All the more reason for me to get my own job then. Girls my age need money. Kousei: Alright. I can't hire you on the spot, but I'll talk to my coworkers about it as soon as I can. Nozomi: Thanks! I really appreciate it. Nozomi: Just, uh... keep in mind that I've never had a real job before, so it might take me a while to get the hang of things. Kousei: That's fine. Kousei: I know you'll do great, Nozomi. I believe in you. Nozomi: ...... Nozomi: You know, Kousei-kun. I think you might be a natural-born gigolo. Kousei: What, because all I do is rely on others. Nozomi: No, 'cause you're good at buttering people up. Kousei: You think so? Nozomi: It's true. Kousei: Hmm... Well, I guess I better work on improving my domestic skills. Nozomi: If you're worried about your future, I suggest you look for a real job instead. Kousei: Hey, taking care of the house is a legitimate job. Nozomi: Ugh... This guy's actually considering becoming a gigolo. What a creep. Kousei: You know, that term doesn't sit right with me. I'd much rather be called a house-husband, or a stay-at-home dad. Nozomi: Now you're just arguing semantics. Whatever gave you that silly idea in the first place? Kousei: Don't worry about it. Anyway, are there any cafes in the area that you'd recommend? Nozomi: Cafes? Hmm... If you're looking for a place within walking distance... Wait, why do you ask? Kousei: While we were talking about you joining us, I realized something. Kousei: I've never actually been to a real fancy cafe before. Kousei: So I figure I should at least go and experience one for myself. Also, it should be a place that's popular among girls your age, if possible. Nozomi: Okay. Well, if that's what you're looking for... I just so happen to know a great place that sells pancakes a couple of stations from here. Kousei: Great. Kousei: Are you free after this? Nozomi: I've finished sweeping, so I'm free to go home once I change out of these clothes. Kousei: Wanna go there with me then? I'm kinda scared to go to one of those fancy places alone. Nozomi: Don't brazenly admit how much of a wimp you are. Kousei: Come on, please? I can't walk into a cafe full of girls by myself. Nozomi: *sigh*... Oh, alright. But you're paying. Kousei: Sure. Nozomi: Great! Wait one sec while I go get changed! Cafe Worker: Welcome! Party of two? Kousei: Yeah. Cafe Worker: Please follow me! Nozomi: Oh my God, it's SO hard to decide! Look, doesn't all of this stuff sound super delicious? Kousei: Hmm... I'll go with the basic pancakes. And a blend coffee. Nozomi: Alright... I think I'll go with the strawberry-chocolate pancake! Kousei: You love strawberries, don't you? Nozomi: Huh? Well, yeah. Both the tart autumn ones, and the sweeter variety they harvest in the winter! Kousei: Hmm. I guess my dad was right on the money with the strawberry thing. Nozomi: What is this? Kousei: Ah, nothing. Cafe Worker: Are you ready to order? Nozomi: Yes. I'll have the strawberry-chocolate pancakes, and an Assam tea. And for him, the regular pancakes and a blended coffee. Oh, and with butter, please! Cafe Worker: Alright. I'll have your food out to you in just a moment. "
