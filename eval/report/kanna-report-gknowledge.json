            "Kanna: Yes. What can I get for you, ma'am? Housewife A: I'll have the chocolate cake. Housewife B: And I'll have the cheesecake, please. Kanna: Certainly. Housewife A: Oh, but the pancakes look wonderful too. Housewife B: I know! I was eyeing them myself, actually. Housewife A: What's the serving size like for the pancakes? Kanna: Well, a single plate is usually enough to fill up most of our female customers. Housewife B: Okay. Customer A: Excuse me! Kanna: I'll be with you in one moment! Housewife B: Ah! Why don't we split them? Housewife A: Hey, that's a great idea! Housewife A: In that case, we'll have one plate of pancakes along with those other two cakes, please. Also, can I get a house blend coffee as well? Housewife B: Make that two. Kanna: Certainly. Kanna: Thank you for your patience. Have you decided what you'd like to order? Customer B: I'll have a shortcake and a chocolate cake. Oh, and this fruit tart too. Natsume: When would you like your cakes? Customer B: Hmm. In about thirty minutes? Natsume: Understood. Please give a moment. Mikado: Thank you for your patience. Your total comes to 1,340 yen. Customer C: Thank you. Here's 2,000 yen. Mikado: Your change is 660 yen. Thank you for coming. We hope to see you again soon. Customer C: Thanks. Kanna: Mikado-san! I need two blend coffees and a Darjeeling. Also, an Assam tea as well. Mikado: Hmm. Drinks for four... Mikado: If I step away now, though, Natsume may not be able to handle everything on her own. Kanna: Yeah. Maybe we should focus on thinning out this line first. Kanna: Alright. I'll take care of the drinks, so you stay here and keep selling cakes. Mikado: Understood. Natsume: Welcome to Cafe Stella. How may I help you? Kanna: Still... it might take some time to do this all myself. Kanna: Order coming in! I need a plate of pancakes, an omelet rice, and a caprese-style pasta! Suzune: On it! Kanna: Also, I hate to ask--but would you mind helping me making a few drinks? Kanna: I'm afraid my hands are kind of full at the moment. Kousei: We're pretty busy in here too... Is that alright, though, Suzune-san? Suzune: Well, we can't just let her fend for herself. Fine. Go help her with the drinks, Kousei. But once you're done, I need you straight back here. Suzune: I'll try to do as much of the prep work as I can in the meantime. Kousei: Alright. Kanna: Thank you. And sorry for the trouble. Kanna: I'll handle the tea, Takamine-san. I need you to make two house blend coffees. Kousei: Got it. Kanna: I'll be right with you! Kousei: Let me handle this. Kanna: Thank you. Kousei: Thank you for your patience. Yuina: Hello! Kousei: Oh. Why, hello there, Yuina-chan. Yuina: One omelet rice, please! Yuina's Mother: I'm sorry. It looks like we've come during a particularly busy time. Kousei: Oh, that's fine. I'm glad to see you again. Kousei: Do you want your omelet rice thinly-fried like usual? Yuina: Yeah! Also, I want orange juice! Kousei: Of course. Yuina's Mother: As for me... Could I have a pancake and a Darjeeling tea? Kousei: Certainly. I'll have those out to you shortly. Kanna: Yuina-chan came to visit again, did she? Kousei: Yeah. I'd love it if they became regulars from now on. Kanna: By the looks of it, it seems like she already is. Kanna: I bet I can guess what she ordered. Kousei: Yeah. Omelet rice again. Kanna: I suppose that means you'll have to be the one to cook it. Kousei: That's the plan. Kanna: What about the coffee? Will it be ready soon? Kousei: Yeah. All that's left is to add hot water. Kanna: In that case, I'll handle the rest. I've just put on the tea cozies while I wait for the tea to steep. Kanna: Thanks for the help. Kousei: No problem. But you'll have to add two more drinks to the list; an orange juice and a Darjeeling for Yuina-chan and her mom. Kanna: Sure, I'll have those taken care of. Kousei: Sorry about that. I'm back. Suzune: I've finished prepping the pasta for you. You do the rest. Kousei: Got it. Also, we've got a new order. A thinly-fried omelet rice and a plate of pancakes. I'll handle the omelet rice. Suzune: Alright. Suzune: Hmm, guess I'll do the pancakes next. Those dirty dishes are kinda starting to pile up, though. I'd better clean them soon. Suzune: Man, weekend rush is no joke. It's tough without those other two around. Kousei: Well, they've got classes in the morning. Plus their mid-terms are coming up too, so they've gotta study. Suzune: Oh, right. I almost forgot. How're things looking on that front? Think they'll be able to pass? Kousei: From what I can see, they should be fine. Kousei: Or at least, Nozomi should be, since she's always been the studious type to begin with. Hiuchidani-san might have to do a bit of guesswork, though, so I'm not sure about her. Suzune: Gotcha. Kousei: Speaking of which--what were your grades like back when you were their age, Suzune-san? Suzune: I'd already decided to become a pastry chef by then, so I mostly got by with cramming last minute. Suzune: Order up! Pancakes for table two! Nozomi: Okay! Coming! Mei: I'll go relieve Natsume-senpai at the cake display out front. Suzune: Thanks, that'd be--wait, what? Kousei: What are you two doing here?! Aren't you supposed to be studying for your exams?! Nozomi: Don't worry. We're doing fine on that front. Kousei: But-- Nozomi: We both know how busy Saturdays get. I had to come or else I'd feel bad. Besides, look at how much there is to do today. Mei: Did you expect me to just sit by and study quietly in the break room? Hearing how hectic it was outside made it impossible to focus! Suzune: Well, I can get that. Suzune: Sometimes you take the day off, but you still can't stop thinking about work. Happens to me too. Mei: Exactly. Nozomi: That's why we want to get to work. Once things calm down, then we'll go back to studying. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Fine. I hate to say it, but we could use your help. Nozomi: Say no more! I'm taking out the pancakes for table two! Suzune: Come on, stop standing there. We've got work to do too! Kousei: Yes, ma'am! Kousei: Time's up! Nozomi: *siiigh*... Kousei: Alright. Now let's see how you did. Mei: Lay it on me. Mei: This is already the fourth time we've done this test. Nozomi: I can pretty much remember all the answers by now, but I think I'm starting to get WHY they're the right answers instead of just memorizing them--I think. Mei: Yeah. It's pretty crazy how much repetition helps. Kousei: Alright, I'm done grading them. Nozomi: That was quick! Kousei: Well, I've done it four times by now. Anyway, to the results. Kousei: Nozomi, your answers were essentially perfect, but you made a lot of careless mistakes. If it weren't for those, though, you might've gotten a perfect grade. Nozomi: I did try to be careful... but I guess I rushed a bit. Kousei: Also, keep in mind that you go to a different school. The questions on your exam are bound to be different accordingly, so watch out for that. Kousei: By the way, are you feeling alright? This would be a terrible time for you to get sick. Nozomi: Oh, I'm fine. I'm not feeling sick at all. Kousei: Good. Kousei: Now for you, Hiuchidani-san. It looks like you're thinking about question four the wrong way. Mei: Aw, geez. I knew my answer wasn't right. Mei: Thanks to you and Natsume-senpai. Kousei: Either way, I'm confident you aren't going to fail, at the very least. Mei: I sure hope so... Aw, man. Why can't the actual exams just be the same as these? Nozomi: I agree. That would be the easiest solution to all this. Kousei: I can't speak for Nozomi's, but that might be more likely than you think. Kousei: You have the same teacher as Shiki-san, so unless the curriculum's changed dramatically, his tests shouldn't have changed much either. Mei: I really, really hope you're right about that. Natsume: Okay, I'm headed this way. See you tomorrow. Mei: I'm going that way. Good night, guys. Suzune: Alrighty. Time to go home, hop in a hot bath, and crack open a cold one! Nozomi: Drinking alcohol while in the bath is supposed to be dangerous. Suzune: I know. I'll be careful. Nozomi: Huh? Why? Suzune: Well, it is getting pretty dark out. Suzune: I'll see you two tomorrow then. Night. Kousei: Good night. Nozomi: Good night... Nozomi: So, wanna tell me why you're randomly acting so overprotective? Kousei: I don't know; you just don't feel like your usual self. Kousei: You sure you're not working yourself too hard? Nozomi: Do I really seem that out of wack? Kousei: It's not really something visible, per se, like your facial complexion... I dunno. Chalk it up my intuition as your childhood friend, I guess. Kousei: Doesn't seem like you have a fever, at least. Kousei: Which leaves only one other thing... Have you been studying too hard? Nozomi: I mean, I don't THINK so. Kousei: You've been staying up later than usual to study, haven't you? Nozomi: Well, maybe a little. Kousei: Plus you've been working as a waitress too. It's no wonder you seem a bit out of sorts. Nozomi: I told you, I'm fine. Kousei: You call making that many careless mistakes on your test \"fine\"? Nozomi: Urk... Kousei: No more studying for today, alright? I want you to get some sleep. Nozomi: Come on. Kousei: It won't matter how much studying you do if you don't get enough rest. None of it will stick. Kousei: So go home, take a bath or something, and go to bed. Sleep is an important part of staying in top shape. Nozomi: Fine. I'll do what you want. Kousei: Good. Now let's get you home. Nozomi: Okay. Nozomi: Thanks for walking me home. See you tomorrow. Kousei: Yeah. Night. Nozomi: I'm hooome. Nozomi: Phew... Nozomi: Man, I am feeling kind of tired. Nozomi: I must've been accumulating all this fatigue without even noticing it... Not that I haven't been getting ANY sleep... Nozomi: Oh, well. I guess I'll be a good girl and listen to Kousei-kun for once. Time for a bath, then it's straight to bed. Nozomi: Nhh... *snore*... *snore*... Nozomi's Mother: Nozomi! Are you going to sleep in all day? Nozomi: Nh? Mhh? Nozomi's Mother: It's almost nine o'clock, you know! Nozomi: Wuh? Nozomi: Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa--?! Nozomi's Mother: Finally up, are you? What do you want for breakfast? Nozomi: I don't have time for that! Nozomi's Mother: You should at least eat SOMETHING. Nozomi's Mother: You have to get dressed anyway, don't you? I'll make you something in the meantime. Nozomi: Why didn't you wake me up earlier?! Nozomi's Mother: I tried! Don't blame this on me, young lady. Nozomi: I went to sleep so early yesterday! How'd this HAPPEN?! Suzune: I was thinking of going with a Yule Log for our Christmas cake. Kousei: Nice. A classic. Suzune: I don't know how many orders we can expect, so I thought we'd just test the waters this time around. Suzune: Fortunately, it looks like our regular cakes are still going well, so I thought it'd be best to play it safe this year. Suzune: We'll begin taking advance orders starting tomorrow, and go all the way up until Christmas Eve. Kousei: We should probably take a picture of the actual cake before that, though. Otherwise we won't garner much attention. Suzune: I know. I already took some pictures as I was baking the prototype, so we're all good to go. Kousei: Oh. All the better. Kousei: Now we just need to update our social media, start taking orders--Oh, and make some flyers to post around the cafe. Kanna: A Yule Log sounds like a fine idea. Mikado: If it won't interfere with your work, then I have no objections. Natsume: Me neither. I'm just worried that we'll have to set a limit on the number of orders, but I guess we'll have to wait and see. Natsume: Though I highly doubt we'll be flooded with hundreds of orders per day. Kousei: Hopefully not. But yeah, we'll have to wait and see before we can say for sure. Mikado: It seems that we'll need all hands on deck for both Christmas Eve and Christmas Day... Mikado: But aside from Kanna--Natsume, Nozomi, and Mei are all young maidens, so I would hardly be surprised if they had one or two dates already planned on those days. Natsume: You're doing that on purpose, aren't you? Natsume: Of course I don't have any plans. For one thing, I'm busy with work almost every day. Kousei: Nozomi doesn't have a boyfriend either. Kousei: Hiuchidani-san also doesn't... to my knowledge, but we should ask just to make sure. Kanna: Wait a minute. Why'd you exclude me from that list? Isn't that a little rude? Mikado: As far as I am aware, you have no boyfriend either. Kanna: That's not what I'm talking about! You totally excluded me from the \"young maiden\" category! Mikado: How long have you and I been together now? Kanna: Well, sure, I have been working alongside you as a Grim Reaper for many years now... Kanna: And in all that time, I've never been in a relationship, shared a kiss, let alone had sex. Kanna: Both my mind and my body are pure as virgin snow! If that doesn't make me a maiden, then what does?! Mikado: The fact that you can say all of that without even a hint of shame only proves my point. Mikado: If you wish to call yourself a maiden, then have some more modesty. Kanna: I am modest! You're making me sound like some sort of pervert... Nozomi: Um, good morning. Kanna: Good morning. Natsume: Good morning. Mikado: Good morning. Kousei: Hey, Nozomi. You're a bit late today. Nozomi: Sorry. I overslept a bit... Ehehe. Natsume: Did you stay up late again? Nozomi: Actually, as a matter of fact, I went to bed earlier than usual yesterday... Kousei: What'd I tell you? That just means you had a lot of fatigue built up. Nozomi: Urk... I can't argue with that. Kanna: You have been pretty busy these days. Natsume: Your mid-terms start tomorrow, don't they? Maybe you should take the day off today to rest up. Nozomi: Thanks, but I'll be A-OK. Nozomi: I got more than enough rest last night. I'm back in tip-top shape. Natsume: Well, if you say so. Nozomi: I'm gonna go get changed now. Kousei: ...... "

Maybe up the order limit to twenty-five. Kanna: Sounds good. Anyway, I'm sure you can guess why I've asked you two to stay behind. Mei: This is about my eye again, isn't it? Kanna: We just want to know how things are progressing, so this shouldn't take too much of your time. Has anything changed with your eye since we last spoke? Mei: No. I still don't know how to release my butterflies... Kanna: Not to worry. I'm certain you'll get there eventually. Mikado: Our main purpose in opening this cafe has always been to collect butterflies. Thanks to you, that task has been proceeding expeditiously. Mikado: Allow me to thank you for your hard work once again. We owe you our gratitude. Mei: A-All I'm doing is catching butterflies. I'd wouldn't exactly call that \"hard work\"... Mei: B-But either way, I'll continue to do my best to help! Mikado: Thank you. We appreciate it. Mei: ...... Mikado: But while I appreciate your efforts, I will not be transforming into a cat. Mei: Okay. I'm sorry. Kanna: Allow me to thank you as well, Takamine-san. Kousei: Huh? Why me? Kanna: While it was mere coincidence that brought you here to work with us, you've become an invaluable member of our team. Kanna: Many of our customers even come to our cafe specifically to eat your dishes now. Kanna: So thank you very much. You've been an incredible help to us all. Kousei: Well, I mean... this was all because of that \"problem\" I had with my soul in the first place... Kousei: But I'm glad you appreciate me. Honestly, this job has been pretty fulfilling for me too lately. Mikado: Indeed. It would appear your soul's condition has been greatly improving. Kanna: You can't let your guard down just yet, but as long as you keep heading in the right direction, you won't have anything to worry about. Kousei: Phew. That's a relief to hear. I owe it all to Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Huh? Kousei: Thanks for guiding me in the right direction. Mei: N-No, I didn't do anything. Kousei: You did. Thank you for everything. Mei: I-I... Mei: ...... Mei: U-Um, was there anything else you wanted to discuss? Kanna: No, I believe that's it. Mei: In that case, I've got something I need to do, so--! Mikado: Alright. Then we apologize for keeping you. Mei: That's okay! Anyway, I'll be going now! Kousei: Let me walk you-- Mei: Good night! Kousei: Huh? Kousei: Y-Yeah, I am... Kanna: Good night. Kousei: Yeah. Good night... Kousei: ...... Kousei: I should've known... Mei: Y-You're fine. Kousei: Freaking out? Mei: Y-Yeah... I... Um... Mei: ...... Mei: Oh, gosh... I'm so nervous... Mei: U-Umm... I think it would take too long to explain myself, so... h-here! Mei: Yes. It's... my Valentine's Day gift... to you. Kousei: Chocolate! Mei: Y-Yes. It's chocolate, and it's, um... handmade. Kousei: Handmade! Mei: Wow, you're really excited about this... Suzune-san taught me how to make it, so it should taste alright... I think. Kousei: Oh... Is that why you've been going home together lately? Mei: Yeah. I've been going to her apartment so she could teach me. Mei: She's also been helping me by asking you about your preferences and stuff... Kousei: My preferences? Oh, wait. Mei: Ahaha... Sorry. I guess I just felt kind of embarrassed... Kousei: Is that why the others said they weren't giving me any chocolate this year? So this would be a surprise? Mei: What? I don't know anything about that... Mei: But the others knew I was planning on giving you my own chocolate, so... I guess that could be why they did that... Kousei: Phew. I thought for sure you hated me or something... Mei: Wh-What?! Of course not! Why would you think that? Kousei: I mean, you've been avoiding me lately, haven't you? Mei: I-I wasn't... I mean... Well, maybe a little... Kousei: See? Mei: That's only because I didn't want you to find out I was preparing chocolate for you... Mei: But... I'm sorry for acting so weird. I didn't mean to give you the wrong idea. Kousei: It's alright. I've been really anxious these past few days, so it's a relief to know the truth. Mei: Urk... I'm sorry... Kousei: Handmade chocolate, though... This is more than I expected. Thank you. Mei: Um, if you'd like... you're welcome to go ahead and eat it... Kousei: Right now? Mei: Yeah. I actually brought you a fork too. Kousei: To be honest, I was planning to go home and savor it there... Mei: N-No, please! You can't! You can't keep me waiting that long! Mei: My heart's already pounding so fast it's about to explode! Mei: I need to know how you think it tastes right now... or else I'm going to die! Kousei: A-Alright. I'll have a bite... Mei: Please do! There are two inside, so at least try one of them! Right now! Mei: Something like that. It's called a chocolate fondant. Kousei: Sounds fancy. Was it hard to make? Mei: Not at all. Suzune-san was there to guide me through every single step. Mei: Ah, but just for the record--I made this all by myself! And I think I did a pretty good job! Mei: Though, um... it was a lot crispier on the outside when it came out of the oven, but it might be a bit soggy by now. Mei: But it shouldn't taste bad! This was Suzune-san's own personal recipe! I baked it with the utmost care! Mei: The flavor should be to your liking as well! So p-please, go ahead and try some! Kousei: Alright... don't mind if I do then. Mei: H-Help yourself! Kousei: ...... Mei: H-Hello? Kousei: ...... Mei: Senpai? Kousei: ...... Mei: Um... Does it... taste bad? Kousei: It's delicious. Mei: R-Really? Oh, thank goodness! Kousei: Oh god... It's so delicious... Mei: Wait, what? Huh? Kousei: How? How can something taste THIS good?! Mei: O-Oh, come on... You're exaggerating... Kousei: *sniffle*... Mei: Wait, are you crying? You're not pretending, are you? No way. Like, seriously? You're seriously crying? Kousei: I can't help it... Mei: O-Okay? Kousei: Everyone kept saying they wouldn't be giving me any chocolate... Mei: Oh... right. They said it'd be a hassle to get return gifts for everyone. Kousei: Even Nozomi, who usually gives me chocolates every year... gave me nothing. Mei: Wait, every year? Oh, right. You and Nozomi-chan are childhood friends. Kousei: Yeah, but she said she'd only been giving them to me out of force of habit... Mei: Oh... Err... I'm not sure what to say to that. Kousei: In the end, the only person who gave me chocolates was you... And handmade chocolate too... Kousei: Thank you... Thank you, Hiuchidani-san! Mei: I didn't think you'd be THIS emotional... but I'm glad you like it. Mei: But I can't say I was expecting you to start crying... It's a little, um, creepy. Kousei: Yeah, I know. I guess I tried too hard to sell it. Mei: Ah! I KNEW you were pretending, you stinker! Mei: Do you really mean that? Kousei: Yeah. I mean it. Seriously. Kousei: I could finish off both these chocolates right here if I'm not careful. Mei: Phew... Kousei: There's no way you could've gone wrong with Suzune-san's recipe. Mei: Yeah, but still... Kousei: Besides, even if it DID taste bad, I'd never say it to your face. Mei: What? So it really DOES taste bad?! Kousei: No, no. It's delicious. Really. Mei: *sigh*... My heart's pounding so much. Like, I've been feeling so anxious lately. That's why I've been acting so weird... Mei: When I was making the chocolate by hand, I began to understand how you feel, Senpai. Mei: Making food for someone else to eat is incredibly stressful and nerve-wracking... Mei: But it's also really fun, trying to make something that the person will like. Mei: And when you do get that confirmation from them that they like it... Mei: It makes you happier than words can describe! Kousei: I already told you. Why don't you believe me? Mei: Because I'm worried! Kousei: Didn't you taste it yourself beforehand? Mei: Well, yeah. I tried one I made from the same batch, but still... Kousei: It was delicious, wasn't it? Mei: It was, but this one's gone all cold! It's not FRESH! Kousei: Even so, it tastes delicious. Mei: Really? Really, really? Kousei: If you're really that worried about the taste, why don't you try some yourself? Kousei: See? I told you. Mei: Phew... Wait. Ah... Ahh! Kousei: What? Mei: Th-Th-Th-That was... an i-i-indirect k-ki--! Kousei: Oh, right. Sorry. You're pretty sensitive about these sorts of things, aren't you? Mei: O-O-Oh, no! It doesn't bothe--well... i-it does, I guess... Kousei: My bad. I totally forgot. Mei: I-I mean... As long as it's you, I... Mei: ...... Mei: U-U-Umm! Kousei: Hm? Mei: Suzune-san told me something... Kousei: Yeah? Mei: She said that you'd be happy receiving any kind of chocolate for Valentine's Day... Kousei: It's true. I'm pretty thrilled right now. Thank you, seriously. Mei: You're welcome... But she also said that... if I gave you handmade chocolate... Mei: Then... Umm... Kousei: Hm? Mei: Then you'd... umm! Kousei: Yeah? Mei: You'd think that... it meant I had genuine feelings for you... Kousei: O-Oh, come on! I can't believe she told you that too! Mei: Y-Yes... That's what she said... Kousei: I, er, I mean... I was only half-joking when I said that... Mei: You were... joking? Kousei: Y-Yeah. I was just messing with her... Kousei: B-But don't worry! I'm not dumb enough to think you like me just because of a couple chocolates! Mei: ...... Mei: I wouldn't mind... if you thought I did... though. Kousei: O-Okay? Kousei: ...... Kousei: Wait, what?! Mei: ...... Kousei: ...... Kousei: ...... Mei: Um... Mei: ...... Mei: During our girls' night out the other day... everyone kept asking me about that time we went to the pool together... Mei: Eventually, the conversation turned to... whether or not I had f-feelings for you, Senpai... Mei: I said I didn't know... but everyone else said it was obvious that I did... Mei: I thought they might be right... but I've never had any sort of romantic experience before... so I wasn't sure. Mei: I can't say I really understand my own feelings... but at the very least, I do know that you're a very important person to me. Mei: That's... what I wanted to tell you today. Mei: But... Mei: ...... Mei: Just now, I realized that... I really do... love you, Senpai. Mei: I mean, love is supposed to make your heart pound, isn't it? But when I'm with you, it's almost the opposite... I feel so relaxed that I thought it couldn't be love. Mei: But right now... my heart is pounding like crazy. Even though all I'm doing is telling you how I feel... my chest feels like it's about to burst. Mei: When I made up my mind to give you these chocolates... and when I decided to ask Suzune-san to teach me how to make them... Mei: While I practiced... This morning... During work... And while I was sitting here waiting for you earlier too... Mei: My heart wouldn't stop pounding. Mei: You wouldn't believe how nervous I felt. Mei: The truth is... I've had feelings for you all this time. Mei: So it's time I worked up the courage to say it. Mei: I... I think I love you, Senpai. Mei: No, wait... That doesn't sound right... Mei: ...... Mei: Senpai... I love you. Mei: I love the way you thank me, even when I've barely done anything... Mei: I love the way you're so nice to me, and lend an ear to all my worries... Mei: And I love so many other things about you too. Mei: So please... Mei: ...... Mei: Please... go out with me. Mei: Please... take me as your girlfriend. Mei: I... want to be with you from now on, Senpai. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Right now... my heart's also hammering like crazy. Kousei: When I thought you were avoiding me... it made me feel so lonely and so worried. Kousei: I was afraid you didn't like me, and I became really depressed. Kousei: Especially when you ran off without giving me any chocolate. Kousei: But then--you messaged to ask if we could meet. My heart wouldn't stop pounding on the way here. Kousei: This whole day's been a roller coaster of emotions for me. Kousei: But if what I'm feeling is the same thing you are... then I'm in love too. Kousei: In love with you, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Ah... Urk... Kousei: I love you too, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: S-So... Kousei: I want you to go out with me. Mei: ...... Mei: Ahhh... Mei: I'm a total mess of emotions right now... Kousei: Me too... My face must be burning up right now. Mei: ...... Kousei: ...... Mei: ...... Kousei: Uh... if you don't mind... Mei: Huh? Kousei: Could I call you by your first name? It'd feel oddly formal... if I kept using your last name. Mei: Y-Yeah, I agree... Go ahead. You don't have to use an honorific either... if you don't want. Kousei: Oh... Mei: Yeah. You can just call me Mei. Kousei: M... M-M-M... Mei: You're stammering so much... Kousei: I-I can't help it. I've never called you this before... Mei: That's fine. I can be patient. Kousei: M-Mei... Mei: There you go. Ehehe... Kousei: What about you? Mei: Huh? Kousei: Will you start calling me by my name? Mei: Senpai? Kousei: That's not what it says on my birth certificate. Mei: Urk... Mei: ...... Mei: Kousei... san? Kousei: You can drop the honorific too. Mei: Well... I mean, I'm younger than you, so... Mei: But maybe I could call you Kou-kun instead-- Mei: No, wait. That's even more embarrassing. Kousei: Yeah... That's pretty embarrassing for me too. Mei: Well, for now... I'm only going to use your first name when we're alone together. Kousei: A-Alright. I guess we wouldn't want the others to tease us about it. Mei: E-Exactly. Kousei: ...... Mei: ...... Kousei: Y-Yeah. I mean, if that's okay with you... Mei: O-Of course it is! Mei: ...... Mei: Finally... I'm your girlfriend! "

Kanna: And we probably want to do a bit of advertising beforehand too. Kanna: The more promoting we do, the more buzz I think we'll generate on opening day. Natsume: I agree. Suzune: We could stick up posters in front of the shop, hand out flyers... maybe make a website too? Kousei: Don't forget social media. Kousei: We could take some fancy photos of Suzune-san's cakes and post them on Instogram. Kousei: Hiuchidani-san, you and Nozomi use Instogram, don't you? Mei: I have an account, but I don't really post much. Nozomi: Same here. I mostly just use it to chat with my friends. But I'll try to get the word out to my classmates! Nozomi: Shirotaki Academy's not too far from here, so I can see a lot of them coming. Mei: Makihata's a bit further away, but I'll do my best to tell everyone there too! Kousei: Nice. That'd be great. Kousei: I suppose that means we'll need to make an official account for the cafe. Kousei: I've never used Instogram before. Is making an account easy? Mei: Yep! It's super easy. In fact, we could go ahead and do it right now. Kousei: Sure, let's do that. The sooner we set it up, the better. Mei: Speaking of, it might be a good idea to make a Facehook account too. Nozomi: Ohh, yeah. With a Facehook account, we can use it to connect to other sites as well. Mei: Whose e-mail address should we use to register? Kousei: Hmm...

Mikado: Naturally. I use it to exchange e-mails with our suppliers, for instance. Kanna: What?! That's the first I've heard of this! Mikado: You wouldn't know how to send an e-mail anyway. Kanna: Urk... E-Even if that's true, I think it's a little rude to assume things. Kanna: If I put my mind to it, I'm sure I could figure it out... Mei: Thanks. Now then, let's see. I'll put \"Cafe Stella\" as the name. Wait, or should it be in English? Nozomi: I think it's better to register in English. We can always write the description in Japanese later. Mei: Alright. Let's do that. Natsume: I guess I could try advertising the news around campus too. Kousei: I asked Hiroto to do the same, but I bet you'd attract a lot more attention. Suzune: I've printed flyers at my old workplace before. We can print quite a number of copies with just a few thousand yen. Suzune: But I'm not going to have to pay out of my own pocket, am I? Mikado: We can cover all the necessary costs, provided it isn't anything too unreasonable. Suzune: Great. In that case, I have one more idea. "

So, as you know, people come to our shrine to pray for safe childbirth. Nozomi: Apparently, Lady Akaiwa was originally a kind woman who loved all children. Nozomi: Over time, her love for children somehow transformed her into the patron saint of newborns and safe delivery. Nozomi: At least that's what my dad always told me. Kanna: Sounds like a very ordinary and heartwarming story to me. Mikado: And yet exceedingly vague at the same time. Mikado: If we are to believe what the red butterfly told us, God Himself had decided to take her life. Mikado: If that is true, there must be more to the story, something much grimmer...

It's no big deal to us. Kanna: What would everyone like to drink? I'll prepare some refreshments. Nozomi: Huh? But... Kanna: It's no trouble at all. If it'll help you focus on your studies, I'd be happy to help. Nozomi: That's really nice of you. In that case, I'll have a cup of Earl Grey. Mei: Can I get a glass of orange juice? Kanna: Sure. Kanna: What about you two? Natsume: I'll have an Earl Grey too. Kousei: I'll have a coffee. Kanna: Alright. Kousei: Let's get to it then. Did you manage to find the stuff I asked for? Natsume: Here. These were the only ones I had left. Kousei: Thanks. These should help. Natsume: We might be in different majors, but you managed to get into Hitotsuboshi too, so you had to have gotten high grades yourself. Kousei: Well, I had a lot of help, as I'm sure you can imagine. Plus, my grades were only just barely good enough to be accepted. Nozomi: Urgh. These tests are crazy. I can't even figure out this last question with the answer in front of me.

Nozomi: I'm going to go out on a limb and say he didn't succeed. Natsume: Yeah, most of us couldn't stand his class. Not that we hated him, per se; he was a fine person, just his tests were awful. Mei: That's what I hear too. Kousei: This teacher still teaches there? Mei: Yeah, he sure does. Kousei: Well, these tests should be great reference material then. Kousei: As for the English ones, all these questions seem pretty standard. Natsume: At least when I was there, the only subject that had insanely difficult questions was math. Kousei: Good. Then as long as we use these tests and the textbook to review, you should be able to avoid failing. Natsume: Sounds like a lot of rote memorization, though. Kousei: It'll have to do, for now. There's not enough time for her to re-learn all the material. Mei: Thank you very much. Nozomi: At the moment, I guess I'm struggling with Natsume-san's math questions the most. Nozomi: An in-depth explanation would really help. Natsume: Alright. I'll walk you both through it, so listen up. Nozomi: Okay! Mei: I'm all ears. Mei: Thank you! Nozomi: Sorry for the trouble. And thanks. Natsume: Thank you for doing this, Akizuki-san. Natsume: So anyway--if I apply this formula here, using the value I calculated above, that should give me the answer. Does that make sense? Nozomi: Ahh, I see. Now that you explain it like that, I sort of understand... Maybe... Maybe not? Mei: You're amazing, Nozomi-chan. I still don't get it at all! Natsume: Well, that's no surprise. You're learning from scratch. Natsume: I'll try to explain it as simply as I can, okay? But let me know right away if there's something you don't understand. Mei: Okaaay... *sigh*... Kousei: You're sighing way too much. Natsume: If you're not having any trouble with what I just explained, Sumizome-san, you can go ahead and start studying something else. Nozomi: Well, I wouldn't say I fully understand it yet. Nozomi: Alright, though. Can I borrow your English test? I want to use it to study. Natsume: Be my guest. Mei: Sorry I'm delaying us, Nozomi-san. Nozomi: Hey, it's not a big deal. Nozomi: The whole reason we're having this study session is to learn! Nozomi: So let's work hard and do our best to pass, okay? Mei: Yeah! Kanna: And here's your coffee, Takamine-san. Kousei: Oh, thanks. Kanna: By the way, what are you doing? Kousei: I'm putting together a list of stuff I want to cover. Kanna: Oh, okay. Preparing your teaching materials. Would you like me to help? Kousei: You'd be willing? Kanna: Don't worry. I can at least help you organize everything. Kanna: Everyone's studying their hardest. I want to chip in to help too. Kousei: Alright. Grab a seat. Kanna: Thank you. Nozomi: Kousei-kun, can I ask you something? Kousei: What's up? Nozomi: How come the answer to this one is number two? The other choices sound like they make sense too. Kousei: Hm? Let me see. Ah. Well, if you look at the paragraph before the blank, you can tell whether it's a factual or hypothetical statement. Kousei: The question is asking about something that happened in the past, so the answer has to be number two. Number one is a conjunction, so that wouldn't make sense. See? There's a comma here. Nozomi: Oh, you're right! Urk... Why didn't I catch that? Kousei: It's an easy mistake to make. This whole section can be a little tricky. Kousei: But it's something you need to know. You'll find these sorts of questions on the English proficiency test as well. Nozomi: Really? Alright, thanks. I'd better study it some more then. Kanna: You're actually quite smart, aren't you, Takamine-san? Nozomi: You wouldn't think it, would you? We've known each other for ages, and he always helps me study for tests, but even I still can't believe it sometimes. Nozomi: I never see him cramming at home, so I have no idea how his grades are so good. Kousei: Hey, I put in the effort just like everybody else. Kanna: Is that true? Kousei: The most efficient way to retain information is to pay attention in class. That, and taking notes. Kousei: If I do that, a single glance is all it takes to remember what I learned, which also helps me cut down on review time. Kanna: More haste, less speed, as they say. Nozomi: He's been saying that stuff for years. But if it was that easy to pay attention in class, we wouldn't be asking for help in the first place. Nozomi: Ugh, I can't do this. My concentration is shot. Mei: Me too. It feels like my brain is about to burn out... *sputter* *sputter*... Natsume: Oh, it's getting quite late. Alright. Let's call it a day. Mei: *siiigh* Thank you very much... Nozomi: Thank you! Natsume: You're welcome. So what do you think? Feeling a little more confident now? Mei: Uhh, yeah. I think I understand a bit more now... sort of. Natsume: Ah. Well, I'm glad my explanations made sense to you. Mei: I'll try reviewing everything again once I get home. Natsume: If there's anything you don't understand, let me know. Natsume: Even if it's something we've gone over already, don't be embarrassed. It happens sometimes. Mei: Okay. Thank you for your help. Kousei: Why don't we get you to take the same tests Shiki-san lent us tomorrow? Kousei: After you review the questions you get wrong, you can retake them again the next day. Natsume: I think that's a good idea too. Mei: But, like, won't I just be solving the same questions over and over? Natsume: There's nothing wrong with that. The worst thing would be for you to only think you understand. Kousei: Yeah, the goal here is to make sure you comprehend what you're learning. Kousei: If you can get the same grades Shiki-san did, you should be able to pass your exams without a hitch. But simply memorizing her answers won't mean anything. Mei: Yes, I know. Kousei: Are you okay with that too, Nozomi? Nozomi: Sounds good to me. Natsume: Starting tomorrow, I want you to come in to the cafe even on your days off. Kousei: We'll be able to help you study if you use the break room. Though it'll have to be while we're on the job. Mei: Alright. Thank you kindly. Kanna: Also, take these. I made copies of all your English and Japanese history study materials. Nozomi: Thank you so much! Kousei: Japanese history will largely be pure memorization, but for English, make sure you think about your answers carefully and review them. Mei: I will. Kousei: And thanks for helping out too, Akizuki-san. Kanna: Not at all. Helping people in need is also a part of my job now. Mei: Thanks for everything today. Natsume: Don't thank us just yet. Thank us once you've passed your exams. Mei: True. Alright then! I'll do my best! Nozomi: I'm hooome. Rokurou: Welcome back, Nozomi. Rokurou: Pretty late today, aren't you? I thought you didn't have work on Wednesdays. Nozomi: I was studying with a friend today. Kousei-kun and one of my coworkers were helping us prepare for our mid-terms. Nozomi: I wasn't playing around, so relax. Rokurou: That's not really what I'm worried about... Rokurou: I'm glad to see you working so hard, but make sure you don't overdo it. Rokurou: You've been staying up rather late these days, haven't you? Pulling all-nighters isn't good for your health. Nozomi: I know, geez. That's why I'm doing this now, so I don't have to stay up all night. Nozomi: Anyway, I'm going back to my room to do a bit more review. Rokurou: Don't you want to take a bath? Nozomi: Later. Nozomi: ...... Nozomi: ...... Nozomi: ... Nozomi: Nh... Ngh! Ahh, it's already this late? Nozomi: *sigh*... I studied a whole, whole lot. I've never been able to do this much on my own before. Nozomi: I'd better go take a bath now. If I don't get some sleep soon, I won't be able to wake up on time tomorrow. "

Kousei: Is there anything I can help with? Suzune: Wanna start prepping the cheesecakes for me? You remember how to do it, don't you? Kousei: Yeah. Kanna: I'll help out as well. Just tell me what to do. Kousei: Aren't you helping with the Yule Logs, though? Kanna: We've already finished rolling them into log-shapes. All that's left is to add the external decorations, but only Suzune-san is skilled enough to do that. Suzune: I'll be fine. You can go ahead and help him. Kousei: Alright. Mei: Whoa! An actual Yule Log! It looks absolutely scrumptious! Nozomi: Are you finished making them? Suzune: For today, at least. Phew... My shoulders are killing me. Kanna: I'm not surprised. You had to put the finishing touches on all of them. Natsume: Well, they certainly turned out great. Thanks for all your hard work. Kousei: We're not very busy right now, so feel free to take a break if you want, Suzune-san. Suzune: Thanks. I'll take you up on that then. Kanna: Of course. Natsume: Now then, let's get these cakes boxed up. Nozomi & Mei: Okaaay! Mei: Welcome to Cafe Stella! Party of two? If you'd rather not wait, we do have a couple counter seats available right now. Would that be alright? Nozomi: Welcome to Cafe Stella! Ah, you placed an order for two Yule Logs under the name Ota? I'll have them ready for you in just a moment. Natsume: Two pancakes, a blend coffee, and a Guatemalan coffee? I'll have those right out to you. Natsume: Two coffees; house blend and Guatemalan, please. Mikado: Coming right up. Kanna: Oh, Natsume-san! I need to go fetch some more Yule Logs from the kitchen. Can you cover for me while I'm gone? Natsume: I'll go fetch them instead. I need to put in another order anyway. Kanna: Alright, that'd be great. Thank you. Kanna: I apologize for the delay, sir. We'll have them ready in just a minute, so please be patient. Natsume: Order coming in. Two plates of pancakes, please. Kousei: Got it. Suzune: How are the Yule Logs selling? Natsume: Fairly well. Most of the customers who've placed advance orders have arrived to pick them up too. Suzune: Phew. That's a relief... Kousei: Were you that worried? Suzune: Well, yeah. I don't know if they're pranks or what, but sometimes you'll get large orders and then the customer never comes to pick it up. Kousei: That kind of stuff actually happens? I've read stories online, but it's scary how easy it is for a single person to screw you over. Suzune: Fortunately, it doesn't look like that's the case this time. Suzune: Anyway, back to work. Pancakes, was it? Kousei: Yeah. I'll handle them. Suzune: You will? Well, okay. Natsume: I'd better get these Yule Logs delivered too. Suzune: I'll help you carry them. I want to see how our customers are doing anyway. Mei: Welcome to Cafe Stella! Miyama: Hello again. Mei: Oh? You're Yuina-chan's--ah, I beg your pardon. Hello there, Mister Miyama. Miyama: Oh, you don't need to be so formal. Miyama: Actually, I'm also here to pick up a cake that I ordered. Mei: A Yule Log, yes? Wait right here; I'll have it out to you in one moment. Suzune: Welcome. Miyama: Hello again. I just can't ignore your cakes, they're so good. Miyama: My daughter's been looking forward to this for a while too. She says no other cake shop will do. Suzune: I'm flattered. I sincerely hope it's to your liking. Miyama: Oh, no need to worry about that. I'm confident it will be every bit as delicious as all the others I've had before. I'm looking forward to it as well. Suzune: Thank you very much. Your praise means a lot to me. Miyama: Oh, and before I forget. Could I also get some shortcakes, fruit tarts... this cheesecake here... and some mousse cakes, as well? Miyama: Four of each. I'm planning to give them to a few acquaintances as gifts. I'd like more people to see how delicious your cakes are. Especially since it's Christmas Eve, you know. Suzune: Would you like us to include some sort of message? It wouldn't take much time to add a simple plaque to it. Miyama: Oh, no. They're just going to be small gifts for some of my coworkers. I have to get back there once I'm done here. Suzune: It seems like you'll have quite a lot to carry, though... Miyama: Maybe, but I'll manage somehow. The hospital is only a few minutes' walk from here. Suzune: Alright. Mei: Here you are, Mister Miyama. Suzune: Ah, Mei-san. He'd also like shortcakes, fruit tarts, cheesecakes, and champagne mousses. Four of each. Mei: O-Oh, sure! I'll add those to your order. Mei: Let's see... In that case, your total comes to 11,820 yen. Miyama: Alright. One second... Wait, where's my wallet? What? Miyama: Ahh, right. I put it in my bag earlier. Phew. There it is. Miyama: My apologies. Mei: No problem, sir. Now then, you paid with 12,000 yen, so your change comes to 180 yen. Here you are. Miyama: Thank you very much. Suzune: Since you've got quite a few cakes, we separated them into two boxes for you. Miyama: Thank you. Suzune: Thank you for coming, and have a good day. Mei: Come visit us again sometime! Mei: Is he going to be okay with all those cakes? He's not going to get sick, is he? Suzune: They're not all for him. He said he's giving them as gifts to some of his coworkers. Mei: Oh, that makes sense. I guess there's nothing to worry about then. Mei: Ah--welcome to Cafe Stella! Suzune: You know, honestly, it's a lot easier making cakes than dealing with customers. Kousei: How are things looking out there? Suzune: Excellent. Everyone seems as happy as a clam. Suzune: But more importantly, why don't you take a break soon? Things are starting to wind down now. Kousei: Alright. Just let me finish up with this and I will. Kousei: Phew... Mikado: Understood. In that case, we will hold on to it for the meantime. Kousei: Yeah. Mikado: Yes... Yes... Kousei: Is there some kind of problem? Nozomi: Apparently one of our customers forgot something at the cafe, so they called to make sure it's still here. Nozomi: Yeah. They left in a rush so they wouldn't be holding up any other customers. You know how busy the cafe is today, with everyone coming in to pick up their cakes. Mikado: I understand. We'll be waiting. Goodbye. Nozomi: Are they coming back to get it? Mikado: Yes. However, he says that he is rather busy at work at the moment, so he does not know when that will be. Kousei: Then should we keep the bag in the fridge in the meantime? Mikado: No need. I am told it merely contains a Christmas present for his daughter. Kousei: Oh. But if so, he'll need to come get it by tonight. Kousei: As a parent, he's got to be feeling pretty anxious. Nozomi: Probably, yeah. Mikado: Hmm. Would you be willing to deliver it to him for us, Takamine Kousei? Nozomi: Oh, you're right! We can just bring it to him instead! Kousei: I guess I don't mind. Does he live around here? Mikado: You remember the little girl named Miyama Yuina who came to order a cake for her father's birthday, don't you? Mikado: The customer who forgot this present is her father. Kousei: Ahh. So that means I'll be going to the Miwa General Hospital? Mikado: Indeed. It might ruin the surprise for little Yuina if you were to deliver to their house instead. Nozomi: That's probably why her dad wanted to come pick it up himself. Mikado: Yes. Kousei: But that's enough reminiscing. I have a job to do. Kousei: No, I'm looking for a Dr. Miyama. I'm here to return something he forgot. Female Nurse: Ahh. Yes, I've been told. Female Nurse: Please give me a moment. He said he'd like to thank you in person. Female Nurse: He says he'll be with you in a minute. Would you mind waiting? It won't be long. Kousei: Sure. Kousei: Huh? Oh, I'm sorry. I was spacing out a little. Miyama: That's quite alright. I'm the one who should be apologizing. Some father I am, forgetting my own daughter's Christmas present. Miyama: Thank you for returning it to me. I truly appreciate it. Kousei: It was no big deal. Kousei: Can I ask you a question, though? These drawings--they haven't always been here, have they? Miyama: Oh, have they not? They were here when I first started working here. ???: Oh? Dr. Miyama? What are you doing out here? "

Kanna: All we want is a photograph that captures your grace and refinement. Qualities that only a nobleman such as you would possess. Mikado: You need a nobleman, you say? Kanna: Your refinement and dignified bearing are bound to captivate all who see it. Mikado: Hmm... Kanna: It should be a simple matter for you, Your Excellency. You're a bona fide nobleman. A duke, no less. Mikado: Indeed... Indeed I am... Kanna: But of course, we won't force you. Kanna: If you're too chicken, we'll just give up on the idea. Mikado: Hmph! Please. Nothing could be simpler for a nobleman such as I. Kanna: So you'll allow us to take your picture? Mikado: Indeed. I shall show you the difference in class between a regular cat and a Cat Sidhe! Mikado: Anything to be spared of the horror of dry kibble... Kanna: Thank you very much! Heh. Natsume & Kousei: Wow... Kousei: Women scare me sometimes. Natsume: I think that was just His Excellency's pride getting the better of him. But, hmm. I should've tried flattery instead. Kanna: Well, we've known each other for many years. I know which of his buttons to press. Kanna: And honestly, while he acted all embarrassed, I don't think he hates the idea as much as he'd like you to think. Kousei: Oh, really? Kanna: If he was seriously opposed to it, I wouldn't have been able to win him over so easily. Natsume: But do you think he might change his mind later? Kanna: It's certainly a possibility. Natsume: In that case, we'd better take as many photos now, while we can. Kanna: I agree. Strike while the iron's hot. Kanna: You Excellency? Why don't we take a little test photo? Mikado: This instant? I would like to groom my fur beforehand, if possible... Kousei: What are you, a girl? Natsume: Don't worry, Your Excellency. Your fur is always impeccable. All we're asking for is one photo. Just one. Mikado: Well, alright. Natsume: Okay, here we go! Kanna: Aww, that's perfect! What a striking pose! So perfect! Natsume: What form. Look at those rippling muscles. That astonishing bulk. Unbelievable. Kousei: Uh, I'm not sure those are the compliments he's looking for. Natsume: But technically speaking, His Excellency is a male. Don't guys like to be complimented on their figure? Kousei: Hmm, I might not be the best person to ask... Mikado: Like this? Or would this be better? Natsume: Look at those chiseled abs. Those sculpted obliques. Natsume: Majestic! The Cat Sidhe's own Leonidas! Kousei: He's a duke, not a king. "

Are you stupid? Kousei: No, I just mean... I hear people come to Akaiwa Shrine to pray for that sort of thing, so... Nozomi: We've got all sorts of charms; from charms for academic success, to charms for prosperous business! Nozomi: Come on, stop sexually harassing people and follow me. The charms are this way. Kousei: H-Hey, don't pull me like that. Nozomi: Here. Everyone draw one stick from here. Nozomi: Each of the sticks has a number written on it. I want you to tell me what it is.

Kousei: Everything? Wow. Suzune: Mine says... \"Don't rush. Wait for marriage.\" Natsume: I've got fair luck. \"When it comes to your career, play it safe and you'll see good results\"... I sure hope so. Mei: Mine says, let's see... \"Even the loftiest academic goals are achievable through diligence.\" Kousei: In other words, study hard and you'll get good grades. Mei: You bet! I look forward to learning from you this year as well, Takamine-sensei! Mei: Of course! I want to get into the same college as her! Nozomi: That's a great idea! I'm all for it! Nozomi: I got the same fortune as you, so let's both study hard! Kousei: Akaiwa Shrine is pretty famous for having accurate fortunes, so I'm sure it'll be a great year for all of us. Kousei: Hm? Oh, right. Mine says-- Kousei: Hey! Give that back! That's personal information! Mei: I've never even seen this before. Natsume: These days, it's rare for anyone to draw just regular bad luck. Kanna: And what a sinister font too... Nozomi: But if I remember correctly, there's only 1 of those for every 100,000 fortunes. Kousei: If you're going to do something like that, at least make it say \"Outstanding luck\" or something! Suzune: What do you want, a coupon for a free beef bowl? Nozomi: We have that too, actually. There's 1 of those in every 1,000 fortunes. Kousei: Seriously? Mei: You have to be pretty unlucky to draw something with 1-in-100,000 odds... Kanna: You sure know how to pick 'em, Takamine-san.

            "Suzune: Crud. Looks like I'm all out of beer. Mei: Would you like some tea? I haven't drunk directly out of this one yet. Suzune: Sure. By the way, these kelp rolls are delicious. Mei: Hehe. I'll be sure to let my grandma know. Have as many as you want! Suzune: Hey, Kousei! Is it ready yet? I'm already getting full from all these kelp rolls! Kousei: Sorry for the wait. I just finished now. Mei: But you added some kind of smoked ingredient, didn't you? Kousei: You'll see. Go ahead and try it. Suzune: Uh-huh. Mei: ...... Suzune: ...... Mei: Oh? Suzune: Something tastes different. It's a lot more fragrant when I bite into it. Mei: It can't be the bacon, right? Where's this smoky flavor coming from? Suzune: It doesn't seem to be the vegetables, either... What exactly did you do? Kousei: It's the black pepper. That's what I smoked. Mei: Ohh! It's the seasoning! Kousei: Yeah. In a way, black pepper is actually the main ingredient in carbonara. That's where the name of the dish comes from, in fact. Suzune: It's derived from the Italian word for charcoal burner, right? Because there's supposed to be so much pepper on it that it turns black. Kousei: Exactly. I was contemplating whether or not to smoke the salt, but I thought that would change the flavor too much. Kousei: So I decided to smoke the pepper instead. This way it adds a nice kick without destroying the balance of the dish. Suzune: You're right. It really does add a nice kick. It's amazing how a small addition can make such a big difference. Suzune: Even though the seasoning is fundamentally the same, the flavor has a lot more depth. Mei: This is amazing! Just like authentic carbonara! Not that I know what authentic carbonara tastes like, but still! Kousei: Glad you like it. I only just finished smoking the pepper, so the smell might be a little harsh-- Kousei: But as long as I let it sit for a while, it should disappear. Then all I need to do is mix it with some regular black pepper to fine tune the flavor. Suzune: Sounds good. It could use a bit of adjusting, but I definitely think this is good enough to serve to our customers. In all honesty, this really is delicious. Kousei: Thanks. What about you-- Mei: Phew! That was good! Kousei: Wow. Not even a crumb left. Mei: It was too good! Just like real Italian cuisine! Not that I know what real Italian cuisine tastes like, but still! Suzune: You already said that earlier. I get what you're trying to say, though. Kousei: Ahaha... I wasn't expecting this much of a reaction. I'm flattered. Mei: Seriously, it was delicious! You're a genius, Senpai! Kousei: O-Oh stop it... Suzune: Well, since Mei-san is showering you in praise, I'm going to be a little more critical. Suzune: Like you said before, the dish still needs some balancing. Kousei: I know. It's got a pretty strong flavor, so I'm gonna try letting it mellow overnight next time. Suzune: Instead of trying to figure out everything on your own, though, you should ask the others at the cafe to taste-test your dish first. Suzune: Then you can decide if you want to tone it down, or if you actually want to emphasize that distinct flavor. Mei: Ohh, I see! The more unique it tastes, the more likely it is to grab people's interest! Suzune: Exactly. But you might get differing opinions on which one is better, which'll make it harder to decide. Suzune: Still, it's up to you. At the very least, I don't think anyone's going to object to you adding this dish to our menu. Kousei: Alright. I'll give it a shot. Kousei: And thanks, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Huh? Kousei: I wouldn't have come up with this idea without you, so thanks. Mei: Please! All I did was suggest the first thing that came to mind. Mei: Don't underestimate your own genius, Senpai! This really is amazing! Kousei: Th-Thanks. Suzune: Ahem. Kousei: Wh-What? Suzune: We're all out of cheese and sausages, so I'm gonna need you to make me some more. Kousei: You already ate them all? I wanted some too, you know. Suzune: Oh, stop griping. C'mon! Kousei: Alright, alright. Fine. Mei: Senpai! I want to try smoking some other things too! Kousei: Sure. I'll rummage around my fridge and see what else we can toss in the smoker. Mei: This is gonna be great! Kanna: Here's to another great year! Let's all do our best! Suzune: Alrighty. Ready to get back to work? Kousei: Yes, ma'am. Kousei: Not so much changed as added a new twist. I tried smoking the pepper first. Natsume: I can't say it looks or smells particularly different, though... Kousei: You'll see once you try it. Nozomi: Well, I'm gonna go ahead and dig in! Nozomi: That faint hint of smokiness... It's amazing how much difference it makes. Natsume: You said you smoked it yourself? Kousei: Yep. It was all Hiuchidani-san's idea. Mei: Don't be silly. You came up with the idea to smoke the black pepper. Mei: All I did was suggest that we try to make our own bacon. Natsume: Ah. So you spent the break thinking up ways to improve our menu... Natsume: That's very commendable of you. I'm impressed. Kousei: Thanks. How do you think it tastes? Kanna: I, for one, think it's delicious. It gives the dish a lot more added depth. Nozomi: I think so too. This seems like it'd be a real crowd-pleaser. Natsume: It certainly is delicious, but... Kousei: But? Natsume: I feel like the pepper's unique smokiness has a sort of... mature taste to it. Natsume: It's definitely not bad by any means, but--and this is just my personal opinion... Natsume: But I think I actually prefer the regular carbonara. Natsume: So while I'm all for adding this to our menu, I don't think it should replace the original version. Nozomi: You said you added the smoked black pepper to the pasta at the end, right? Kousei: Yeah, I did. Nozomi: In that case, why don't we just serve our regular carbonara with a shaker of smoked black pepper on the side? Nozomi: That way, customers can add as much or as little as they want. Natsume: How would we know how much to prepare in advance, though? Some customers might use a lot more than others. Suzune: A lot of beef bowl restaurants used to do the same thing with their special shichimi spices, but they had to stop the practice a little while back. Suzune: Some customers were using unbelievable amounts of spice, which ended up hurting their profits. Nozomi: Oh... I guess that won't work then. Kanna: It seems like our safest option would be to add this smoked pepper version as a separate item on the menu. Kousei: Alright. So I have all the judges' approval? Kanna: Absolutely. I think this would make a fine addition to our menu. Nozomi: Me too. Natsume: Me three. Kanna: What do you think, Mikado-san? Mikado: I believe Natsume mentioned earlier that this dish had a rather mature taste. However, many of our customers also come here specifically for our coffee and tea. Mikado: Judging from what I have gathered, this would suit their preferences well. Mikado: Therefore, I am in agreement. Kousei: Thank goodness... Mei: Way to go, Senpai! Kousei: Thanks! Kousei: I was just gonna do it at home, actually... Mikado: Among other problems, that would be quite expensive. I would not recommend you do that. Kousei: I guess that's true. Mikado: I do have some other ideas you may wish to consider. Are you free to talk after this? Kousei: Sure. I've got time. Kanna: In that case, let's call it a day here. See you tomorrow, everyone. Natsume: See you tomorrow. Nozomi: See you tomorrow! Kousei: Phew... Kousei: Huh? Hiuchidani-san? Mei: Hey. Kousei: What are you still doing here? Mei: I was waiting for you to finish. Kousei: You could've waited inside. Mei: Ahaha. I didn't want to bother you guys. Mei: Anyway, I know I should've said something earlier... but would you mind walking me home? Kousei: Sure. I don't mind. Let's go. Mei: Thanks! Mei: Congratulations on getting your new recipe approved, by the way. Kousei: Well, you helped with that. Mei: Not at all. You did this on your own, Senpai. Kousei: Nah, it's all thanks to you. I would've never come up with this idea on my own. Kousei: Seriously, thank you. I'm really grateful. Kousei: This might sound kind of melodramatic... but I think I've gained a little more confidence in myself now. Mei: Ehehe... You're gonna make me blush. I don't mean to sound melodramatic either, but, like... Mei: You've done a lot for me as well, Senpai. Ever since you've helped me open up about my left eye, I feel like a huge weight's been lifted off my shoulders. Mei: That's why I wanted to be able to return the favor if I could. Mei: I'm glad I managed to be of some small help to you. Kousei: It wasn't small at all. You were a big help. Kousei: I was hoping to do something like this before I had to deal with my exams, so I'm glad it all went so well. Mei: Oh, your exams are coming up? Kousei: At the end of the month, yeah. Mei: Does that mean you're gonna be working fewer hours? Kousei: No, I'll be working the same as usual. I'll do fine as long as I pay attention in class. Kousei: And I can always study after work too. Mei: You're a pretty diligent student, aren't you? Kousei: I don't know about that... I'm just the sort of guy who hates procrastinating. Mei: That's what it means to be diligent, Senpai. I think that's something to be proud of. Kousei: Nah, trust me... I can be pretty lazy when I want. Mei: But in front of me, at least, you're always hardworking and dependable. Kousei: Okay, sheesh. Stop flattering me. It's gonna go to my head. Mei: Ahaha! Alright. Mei: Well, good night, Senpai. Kousei: Good night. And sorry you had to wait for me earlier. Mei: That's okay. I waited because I wanted to congratulate you. Mei: Anyway, see you tomorrow! Kousei: Yeah. See you tomorrow.

Kousei: Shiki-san and Nozomi should already be here, so let's head inside. Mei: Okay. Mei: Good morning! Kanna: Welcome, you two. Mei: It's a little weird being greeted with a \"Welcome\" when the cafe's closed. Kanna: Then by that logic, saying \"Good morning\" is weird too, no? We're not working. Mei: I guess that's true. Kanna: You're here to study for your exams, right? Natsume-san and Nozomi-san are already here. Kousei: Yeah, sorry. Nozomi: It's fine. You two were in class. Natsume: You don't have to apologize. It's no big deal to us. Kanna: What would everyone like to drink? I'll prepare some refreshments. Nozomi: Huh? But... Kanna: It's no trouble at all. If it'll help you focus on your studies, I'd be happy to help. Nozomi: That's really nice of you. In that case, I'll have a cup of Earl Grey. Mei: Can I get a glass of orange juice? Kanna: Sure. Kanna: What about you two? Natsume: I'll have an Earl Grey too. Kousei: I'll have a coffee. Kanna: Alright. Kousei: Let's get to it then. Did you manage to find the stuff I asked for? Natsume: Here. These were the only ones I had left. Kousei: Thanks. These should help. Natsume: We might be in different majors, but you managed to get into Hitotsuboshi too, so you had to have gotten high grades yourself. Kousei: Well, I had a lot of help, as I'm sure you can imagine. Plus, my grades were only just barely good enough to be accepted. Nozomi: Urgh. These tests are crazy. I can't even figure out this last question with the answer in front of me. Mei: I'm getting a headache just looking at it. Kousei: Yeah, there are quite a few nasty questions in here. Natsume: You can thank my teacher, Saeki-sensei, for that. Apparently, he was a huge math buff. Natsume: Rumor had it he made these questions specifically to be solved using applied mathematics, just to show students the beauty of mathmatics. Nozomi: I'm going to go out on a limb and say he didn't succeed. Natsume: Yeah, most of us couldn't stand his class. Not that we hated him, per se; he was a fine person, just his tests were awful. Mei: That's what I hear too. Kousei: This teacher still teaches there? Mei: Yeah, he sure does. Kousei: Well, these tests should be great reference material then. Kousei: As for the English ones, all these questions seem pretty standard. Natsume: At least when I was there, the only subject that had insanely difficult questions was math. Kousei: Good. Then as long as we use these tests and the textbook to review, you should be able to avoid failing. Natsume: Sounds like a lot of rote memorization, though. Kousei: It'll have to do, for now. There's not enough time for her to re-learn all the material. Mei: Thank you very much. Nozomi: At the moment, I guess I'm struggling with Natsume-san's math questions the most. Nozomi: An in-depth explanation would really help. Natsume: Alright. I'll walk you both through it, so listen up. Nozomi: Okay! Mei: I'm all ears. Mei: Thank you! Nozomi: Sorry for the trouble. And thanks. Natsume: Thank you for doing this, Akizuki-san. Natsume: So anyway--if I apply this formula here, using the value I calculated above, that should give me the answer. Does that make sense? Nozomi: Ahh, I see. Now that you explain it like that, I sort of understand... Maybe... Maybe not? Mei: You're amazing, Nozomi-chan. I still don't get it at all! Natsume: Well, that's no surprise. You're learning from scratch. Natsume: I'll try to explain it as simply as I can, okay? But let me know right away if there's something you don't understand. Mei: Okaaay... *sigh*... Kousei: You're sighing way too much. Natsume: If you're not having any trouble with what I just explained, Sumizome-san, you can go ahead and start studying something else. Nozomi: Well, I wouldn't say I fully understand it yet. Nozomi: Alright, though. Can I borrow your English test? I want to use it to study. Natsume: Be my guest. Mei: Sorry I'm delaying us, Nozomi-san. Nozomi: Hey, it's not a big deal. Nozomi: The whole reason we're having this study session is to learn! Nozomi: So let's work hard and do our best to pass, okay? Mei: Yeah! Kanna: And here's your coffee, Takamine-san. Kousei: Oh, thanks. Kanna: By the way, what are you doing? Kousei: I'm putting together a list of stuff I want to cover. Kanna: Oh, okay. Preparing your teaching materials. Would you like me to help? Kousei: You'd be willing? Kanna: Don't worry. I can at least help you organize everything. Kanna: Everyone's studying their hardest. I want to chip in to help too. Kousei: Alright. Grab a seat. Kanna: Thank you. Nozomi: Kousei-kun, can I ask you something? Kousei: What's up? Nozomi: How come the answer to this one is number two? The other choices sound like they make sense too. Kousei: Hm? Let me see. Ah. Well, if you look at the paragraph before the blank, you can tell whether it's a factual or hypothetical statement. Kousei: The question is asking about something that happened in the past, so the answer has to be number two. Number one is a conjunction, so that wouldn't make sense. See? There's a comma here. Nozomi: Oh, you're right! Urk... Why didn't I catch that? Kousei: It's an easy mistake to make. This whole section can be a little tricky. Kousei: But it's something you need to know. You'll find these sorts of questions on the English proficiency test as well. Nozomi: Really? Alright, thanks. I'd better study it some more then. Kanna: You're actually quite smart, aren't you, Takamine-san? Nozomi: You wouldn't think it, would you? We've known each other for ages, and he always helps me study for tests, but even I still can't believe it sometimes. Nozomi: I never see him cramming at home, so I have no idea how his grades are so good. Kousei: Hey, I put in the effort just like everybody else. Kanna: Is that true? Kousei: The most efficient way to retain information is to pay attention in class. That, and taking notes. Kousei: If I do that, a single glance is all it takes to remember what I learned, which also helps me cut down on review time. Kanna: More haste, less speed, as they say. Nozomi: He's been saying that stuff for years. But if it was that easy to pay attention in class, we wouldn't be asking for help in the first place. Nozomi: Ugh, I can't do this. My concentration is shot. Mei: Me too. It feels like my brain is about to burn out... *sputter* *sputter*... Natsume: Oh, it's getting quite late. Alright. Let's call it a day. Mei: *siiigh* Thank you very much... Nozomi: Thank you! Natsume: You're welcome. So what do you think? Feeling a little more confident now? Mei: Uhh, yeah. I think I understand a bit more now... sort of. Natsume: Ah. Well, I'm glad my explanations made sense to you. Mei: I'll try reviewing everything again once I get home. Natsume: If there's anything you don't understand, let me know. Natsume: Even if it's something we've gone over already, don't be embarrassed. It happens sometimes. Mei: Okay. Thank you for your help. Kousei: Why don't we get you to take the same tests Shiki-san lent us tomorrow? Kousei: After you review the questions you get wrong, you can retake them again the next day. Natsume: I think that's a good idea too. Mei: But, like, won't I just be solving the same questions over and over? Natsume: There's nothing wrong with that. The worst thing would be for you to only think you understand. Kousei: Yeah, the goal here is to make sure you comprehend what you're learning. Kousei: If you can get the same grades Shiki-san did, you should be able to pass your exams without a hitch. But simply memorizing her answers won't mean anything. Mei: Yes, I know. Kousei: Are you okay with that too, Nozomi? Nozomi: Sounds good to me. Natsume: Starting tomorrow, I want you to come in to the cafe even on your days off. Kousei: We'll be able to help you study if you use the break room. Though it'll have to be while we're on the job. Mei: Alright. Thank you kindly. Kanna: Also, take these. I made copies of all your English and Japanese history study materials. Nozomi: Thank you so much! Kousei: Japanese history will largely be pure memorization, but for English, make sure you think about your answers carefully and review them. Mei: I will. Kousei: And thanks for helping out too, Akizuki-san. Kanna: Not at all. Helping people in need is also a part of my job now. Mei: Thanks for everything today. Natsume: Don't thank us just yet. Thank us once you've passed your exams. Mei: True. Alright then! I'll do my best! Nozomi: I'm hooome. Rokurou: Welcome back, Nozomi. Rokurou: Pretty late today, aren't you? I thought you didn't have work on Wednesdays. Nozomi: I was studying with a friend today. Kousei-kun and one of my coworkers were helping us prepare for our mid-terms. Nozomi: I wasn't playing around, so relax. Rokurou: That's not really what I'm worried about... Rokurou: I'm glad to see you working so hard, but make sure you don't overdo it. Rokurou: You've been staying up rather late these days, haven't you? Pulling all-nighters isn't good for your health. Nozomi: I know, geez. That's why I'm doing this now, so I don't have to stay up all night. Nozomi: Anyway, I'm going back to my room to do a bit more review. Rokurou: Don't you want to take a bath? Nozomi: Later. Nozomi: ...... Nozomi: ...... Nozomi: ... Nozomi: Nh... Ngh! Ahh, it's already this late? Nozomi: *sigh*... I studied a whole, whole lot. I've never been able to do this much on my own before. Nozomi: I'd better go take a bath now. If I don't get some sleep soon, I won't be able to wake up on time tomorrow. "

How are things going on your end? Kousei: We're getting there. I think we'll be ready to invite you back for another visit soon. Kousei: And when we do, we're gonna knock your socks off, old man.

The lack of sun before made it feel a bit chilly in here. Mikado: Indeed. I can sense a definite change in the air as well. Mikado: Perhaps now we can invite the landlady back for another inspection?

            "Kousei: Morning, everyone. Suzune: Hey. Kanna: Good morning, Takamine-san. Kousei: How are the Yule Logs coming along? Suzune: We're about 80\\% done, I think. Kousei: Is there anything I can help with? Suzune: Wanna start prepping the cheesecakes for me? You remember how to do it, don't you? Kousei: Yeah. Kanna: I'll help out as well. Just tell me what to do. Kousei: Aren't you helping with the Yule Logs, though? Kanna: We've already finished rolling them into log-shapes. All that's left is to add the external decorations, but only Suzune-san is skilled enough to do that. Suzune: I'll be fine. You can go ahead and help him. Kousei: Alright. Mei: Whoa! An actual Yule Log! It looks absolutely scrumptious! Nozomi: Are you finished making them? Suzune: For today, at least. Phew... My shoulders are killing me. Kanna: I'm not surprised. You had to put the finishing touches on all of them. Natsume: Well, they certainly turned out great. Thanks for all your hard work. Kousei: We're not very busy right now, so feel free to take a break if you want, Suzune-san. Suzune: Thanks. I'll take you up on that then. Kanna: Of course. Natsume: Now then, let's get these cakes boxed up. Nozomi & Mei: Okaaay! Mei: Welcome to Cafe Stella! Party of two? If you'd rather not wait, we do have a couple counter seats available right now. Would that be alright? Nozomi: Welcome to Cafe Stella! Ah, you placed an order for two Yule Logs under the name Ota? I'll have them ready for you in just a moment. Natsume: Two pancakes, a blend coffee, and a Guatemalan coffee? I'll have those right out to you. Natsume: Two coffees; house blend and Guatemalan, please. Mikado: Coming right up. Kanna: Oh, Natsume-san! I need to go fetch some more Yule Logs from the kitchen. Can you cover for me while I'm gone? Natsume: I'll go fetch them instead. I need to put in another order anyway. Kanna: Alright, that'd be great. Thank you. Kanna: I apologize for the delay, sir. We'll have them ready in just a minute, so please be patient. Natsume: Order coming in. Two plates of pancakes, please. Kousei: Got it. Suzune: How are the Yule Logs selling? Natsume: Fairly well. Most of the customers who've placed advance orders have arrived to pick them up too. Suzune: Phew. That's a relief... Kousei: Were you that worried? Suzune: Well, yeah. I don't know if they're pranks or what, but sometimes you'll get large orders and then the customer never comes to pick it up. Kousei: That kind of stuff actually happens? I've read stories online, but it's scary how easy it is for a single person to screw you over. Suzune: Fortunately, it doesn't look like that's the case this time. Suzune: Anyway, back to work. Pancakes, was it? Kousei: Yeah. I'll handle them. Suzune: You will? Well, okay. Natsume: I'd better get these Yule Logs delivered too. Suzune: I'll help you carry them. I want to see how our customers are doing anyway. Mei: Welcome to Cafe Stella! Miyama: Hello again. Mei: Oh? You're Yuina-chan's--ah, I beg your pardon. Hello there, Mister Miyama. Miyama: Oh, you don't need to be so formal. Miyama: Actually, I'm also here to pick up a cake that I ordered. Mei: A Yule Log, yes? Wait right here; I'll have it out to you in one moment. Suzune: Welcome. Miyama: Hello again. I just can't ignore your cakes, they're so good. Miyama: My daughter's been looking forward to this for a while too. She says no other cake shop will do. Suzune: I'm flattered. I sincerely hope it's to your liking. Miyama: Oh, no need to worry about that. I'm confident it will be every bit as delicious as all the others I've had before. I'm looking forward to it as well. Suzune: Thank you very much. Your praise means a lot to me. Miyama: Oh, and before I forget. Could I also get some shortcakes, fruit tarts... this cheesecake here... and some mousse cakes, as well? Miyama: Four of each. I'm planning to give them to a few acquaintances as gifts. I'd like more people to see how delicious your cakes are. Especially since it's Christmas Eve, you know. Suzune: Would you like us to include some sort of message? It wouldn't take much time to add a simple plaque to it. Miyama: Oh, no. They're just going to be small gifts for some of my coworkers. I have to get back there once I'm done here. Suzune: It seems like you'll have quite a lot to carry, though... Miyama: Maybe, but I'll manage somehow. The hospital is only a few minutes' walk from here. Suzune: Alright. Mei: Here you are, Mister Miyama. Suzune: Ah, Mei-san. He'd also like shortcakes, fruit tarts, cheesecakes, and champagne mousses. Four of each. Mei: O-Oh, sure! I'll add those to your order. Mei: Let's see... In that case, your total comes to 11,820 yen. Miyama: Alright. One second... Wait, where's my wallet? What? Miyama: Ahh, right. I put it in my bag earlier. Phew. There it is. Miyama: My apologies. Mei: No problem, sir. Now then, you paid with 12,000 yen, so your change comes to 180 yen. Here you are. Miyama: Thank you very much. Suzune: Since you've got quite a few cakes, we separated them into two boxes for you. Miyama: Thank you. Suzune: Thank you for coming, and have a good day. Mei: Come visit us again sometime! Mei: Is he going to be okay with all those cakes? He's not going to get sick, is he? Suzune: They're not all for him. He said he's giving them as gifts to some of his coworkers. Mei: Oh, that makes sense. I guess there's nothing to worry about then. Mei: Ah--welcome to Cafe Stella! Suzune: You know, honestly, it's a lot easier making cakes than dealing with customers. Kousei: How are things looking out there? Suzune: Excellent. Everyone seems as happy as a clam. Suzune: But more importantly, why don't you take a break soon? Things are starting to wind down now. Kousei: Alright. Just let me finish up with this and I will. Kousei: Phew... Mikado: Understood. In that case, we will hold on to it for the meantime. Kousei: Yeah. Mikado: Yes... Yes... Kousei: Is there some kind of problem? Nozomi: Apparently one of our customers forgot something at the cafe, so they called to make sure it's still here. Nozomi: Yeah. They left in a rush so they wouldn't be holding up any other customers. You know how busy the cafe is today, with everyone coming in to pick up their cakes. Mikado: I understand. We'll be waiting. Goodbye. Nozomi: Are they coming back to get it? Mikado: Yes. However, he says that he is rather busy at work at the moment, so he does not know when that will be. Kousei: Then should we keep the bag in the fridge in the meantime? Mikado: No need. I am told it merely contains a Christmas present for his daughter. Kousei: Oh. But if so, he'll need to come get it by tonight. Kousei: As a parent, he's got to be feeling pretty anxious. Nozomi: Probably, yeah. Mikado: Hmm. Would you be willing to deliver it to him for us, Takamine Kousei? Nozomi: Oh, you're right! We can just bring it to him instead! Kousei: I guess I don't mind. Does he live around here? Mikado: You remember the little girl named Miyama Yuina who came to order a cake for her father's birthday, don't you? Mikado: The customer who forgot this present is her father. Kousei: Ahh. So that means I'll be going to the Miwa General Hospital? Mikado: Indeed. It might ruin the surprise for little Yuina if you were to deliver to their house instead. Nozomi: That's probably why her dad wanted to come pick it up himself. Mikado: Yes. Kousei: But that's enough reminiscing. I have a job to do. Kousei: No, I'm looking for a Dr. Miyama. I'm here to return something he forgot. Female Nurse: Ahh. Yes, I've been told. Female Nurse: Please give me a moment. He said he'd like to thank you in person. Female Nurse: He says he'll be with you in a minute. Would you mind waiting? It won't be long. Kousei: Sure. Kousei: Huh? Oh, I'm sorry. I was spacing out a little. Miyama: That's quite alright. I'm the one who should be apologizing. Some father I am, forgetting my own daughter's Christmas present. Miyama: Thank you for returning it to me. I truly appreciate it. Kousei: It was no big deal. Kousei: Can I ask you a question, though? These drawings--they haven't always been here, have they? Miyama: Oh, have they not? They were here when I first started working here. ???: Oh? Dr. Miyama? What are you doing out here? "

            "Suzune: Alright. How's this? Kousei: Wow... Kousei: It looks pretty different from the old cake. Suzune: The overall composition is still the same, though, just so you know. Kousei: Really? Suzune: Give it a try first. You'll see. Kousei: Alright... Don't mind if I do. Kousei: Yeah. I wasn't expecting it. Suzune: Ah. Then mission accomplished. Kousei: So, uh, this new cake of yours... It's filled with thick, sticky sauce... Kousei: ...... Kousei: The inspiration for this wouldn't happen to be something obscene, would it? Suzune: ...... Suzune: *sigh*... Of course not. Don't be gross. Not everything's connected to sex, you know. Kousei: Sorry. My bad. Suzune: Quit messing around and take a bite. Kousei: Alright. Suzune: Really? Kousei: Absolutely. Don't doubt yourself. Suzune: That's not what my issue is. I changed quite a bit from the old cake. Kousei: What else did you change, besides covering it with chocolate frosting and swapping the puree to a sauce? Suzune: Those alone are pretty significant changes. Suzune: The amount of chocolate I had to use was different, and the sauce might not have combined as well I was hoping. Kousei: Ahh. I guess that's true. Kousei: Since you had to use more chocolate, though... was this even more expensive to make than the old one? Suzune: No, it was actually cheaper. I managed to keep the whole thing just under 500 yen, at 480 yen. Kousei: That's awesome and all, but how? Suzune: Since I used more chocolate, the taste would've been too thick if I kept it at the same consistency. By thinning it out somewhat, the price also went down. Kousei: Oh, okay. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Hardly. I have no-- Suzune: Look, I know what you want to say. When it comes down to it, it doesn't feel all that different from the old cake, does it? Kousei: Well... Kousei: Yeah. That's kinda the feeling I got too. Suzune: Well, personally, I think a Valentine's Day cake is something that's meant to be shared with someone else. Kousei: Ah... Kousei: Ah. Something that you'd want to talk about and show other people. Suzune: Yep, exactly. Also-- Kousei: Also? Suzune: *smooch* Kousei: Ngh?! Suzune: That wasn't a kiss, for your information. I was just cleaning the corner of your mouth for you. You had some sauce stuck there. Kousei: ...... Kousei: So that's another scenario you're hoping this cake will lead to? Suzune: Bingo. *giggle* Suzune: The old one was definitely easier to eat, but if you're going to be sharing it with someone, I think this one takes the cake, so to speak. Kousei: Yeah. I'd have to agree. Kousei: It tastes just as good as the other cake, so I'd say this one is better for sharing with someone else. Suzune: Then we're in agreement. Suzune: Phew... Thank goodness I made it in time. Kousei: You definitely cut it pretty close. Kousei: You nervous? Suzune: Of course I am. My heart's pounding like crazy. Suzune: ...... Kousei: It'll be okay. Kousei: But if you do end up losing... feel free to blame it on me and my lack of experience with being a taste-tester. Suzune: Thanks. Suzune: I'm not going to blame you, though. Even if I do lose, it'll only be because I wasn't good enough. Suzune: But it'll be alright. I won't let it get me down. I'll just use it as motivation to work harder. Suzune: Plus, I now have someone by my side who'll support me through thick and thin. Kousei: ...... Kousei: On second thought, I think I'm gonna skip class tomorrow. Suzune: Why? Kousei: Because I want to be there to support you through the interview. Suzune: I'll be fine. Don't worry about it. Suzune: In fact, I want to do it alone. Kousei: You do? Suzune: Yep. I gotta maintain some semblance of self-reliance as an adult. Plus, this is MY unfinished business. I have to settle it on my own. Kousei: Well, if you're that set on it, I guess I won't go. Suzune: But... if I DO wind up getting heartbroken, you'll be there to comfort me, won't you? Kousei: Hmm... I'm not sure about that. Suzune: Why not? Kousei: I mean, I obviously would like to comfort you, but if that happened, that would mean your cake lost the competition. Kousei: In that case, I think I'd be just as angry as you. Suzune: Fine... Then you can comfort me instead by celebrating with me when I win the Grand Prix. Kousei: Now that I can do. Gladly. Suzune: *giggle* You're so silly. Kousei: But if I went... Suzune-san would probably get mad at me. Kousei: *sigh*... This sucks. Kousei: Is she really gonna be alright? Suzune: *inhale*... *exhale*... *inhale*... *exhale*...  Kanna: Are you alright, Suzune-san? You're not looking too well... Suzune: Thanks. I'm fine. Suzune: I'm just a little nervous... but I'm not gonna run away from this. Suzune: If anything, I'm grateful for a chance to finally get my revenge. Kanna: Okay. Mikado: The interviewers are here. Are you ready? Kanna: Showtime. Get out there and knock their socks off with your cake, Suzune-san! Suzune: You bet! Kousei: *pant*... *pant*... *pant*... Kousei: Is Suzune-san here, or did she already go home? Kousei: Well, I just had to know. Kousei: Is the interview already over? Suzune: Yep. It didn't take too long. Kousei: How do you think it went? Suzune: Hmm... Hard to say, to be honest. Suzune: My old boss was always the hard-to-read type. I'm not really sure what his impressions were. Kousei: Okay. Kousei: Well, what about you? How do personally feel about it? Suzune: Well... I guess it wasn't as big a deal as I thought it'd be. Suzune: By the way, want to eat dinner together tonight? Suzune: Maybe it's because I know I've changed... I know I'm not the same old me I used to be. Suzune: When I came face to face with him again, it didn't phase me much at all. Suzune: Same as always, I suppose. From his point of view, though, he was probably just glad to see me doing well. Kousei: Ah, okay. Kousei: What about the interviewers? How did they react? Suzune: They seemed to like the cake... but you gotta be careful with people like them. Sometimes they'll say it's good, then trash all over it in their article. Kousei: Damn... Suzune: Well, either way... I'm kinda glad I went through with this. Seeing him again was the right thing to do... Kousei: How so? Suzune: It helped me realize again how much I've changed. Suzune: I really am glad I started working here. Kousei: Where's this coming from? Suzune: And it's all because I met you. *giggle* Kousei: You're too kind. Suzune: That said, I'm not gonna get too sentimental on you. And to be more accurate, I should've said \"you guys.\" Suzune: Everyone at the cafe works so hard to make our customers smile. Suzune: Seeing how earnestly all of you strove towards that goal changed what the word \"professional\" meant to me. Suzune: And it changed my perspective on the world as a whole. Suzune: It's a little aggravating, though. I'm sure my old boss saw right through me. Kousei: When you first started working here, you were already an excellent pastry chef. Kousei: In that case, what matters is the experience you gained. Kousei: Not baking experience, but life experience. Suzune: I'm gonna beat him. I'm gonna win over that old fart if it's the last thing I do. Kousei: Did you not win with your cake today? Suzune: It was only an interview. Hopefully his impression of me has changed... but I doubt he'd tell me even if it had. Suzune: Anyway, that's why I'm gonna win him over with my cakes one day. You can bet on it. Kousei: ...... Kousei: I'd love to be there when that happens. Kousei: That's why I've decided that I'm going to stay with you and continue helping you with your work, Suzune-san. Suzune: What, you're planning to be my assistant for the rest of your life or something? Kousei: No, I didn't mean that. I think there are even better ways I can support you. Kousei: I mean, you're probably thinking of opening up your own business at some point in the future, right? Suzune: Well... someday, I suppose. Not that I necessarily plan on being my own boss, though. Kousei: Yeah, so that's what I want to help you with. Kousei: In order to run a business, you're going to need someone who knows how to manage sales and finances in addition to your skills as a pastry chef. Kousei: That's where I come in. Kousei: I want to see you succeed over your old boss. Suzune: Ah, okay. Suzune: *giggle*... I guess I am gonna need some help in those areas. If you could do that, that'd be great. Kousei: ...... Kousei: You agreed pretty easily. Do you not believe me? Suzune: Don't be silly. Of course I do. Suzune: I know you're the sort of person who keeps their promises, no matter what. Kousei: Thanks. Suzune: No, thank you. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Hey. When spring comes, why don't we start selling that cake of yours? Suzune: Why? Kousei: Because it's delicious. Kousei: So delicious that I want other people to get the chance to try it. Suzune: Yeah, but... Kousei: I know. I'll think of something. Kousei: I'll find a way to make it popular, even if it costs over 600 yen. Kousei: If I can't even do that, I doubt I'll be able to continue supporting you in the future. Suzune: Pfft. I guess that's true. That might be a good idea. Suzune: In that case, I'll be counting on you. Kousei: Yes, ma'am! Customer: Excuse me! I'd like to order the Grand Prix-winning cake, please! Suzune: Coming right up! "

Why does my stomach hurt so much? Kousei: (Wh-Whoa. You're not looking too good. Are you alright?) Kousei: ...... Kousei: I've already decided where we're going to go. Kousei: Just gotta make sure I don't miss my mark today. Natsume: Even if there are slip-ups, it'll be a successful date as long as you can laugh it off together. Natsume: Don't be scared. All you have to do is stay calm and talk to her like you normally do. Natsume: Most of all, don't focus on trying to make things \"special.\" That's not the important part, okay? Do you understand? Kousei: Make it fun. Make Akizuki-san smile while we're together. Kousei: *inhale*... *exhale*... *inhale*... *exhale*...  Kanna: Ah, good morning. Kousei: Morning. Kanna: You're right on time. Kousei: Not like I live that far away. Kousei: Anyway, you ready to go? Kanna: Already? If we're not in a hurry, I'd be happy to make you a cup of coffee or something first. Kousei: Hmm... Kousei: No, not today. If you're ready, let's get going. Kanna: Okay. Mikado: Alright. Take care. Kanna: So, where are we going? Kousei: What do you say we get something to eat first? Kousei: We might as well eat out while we're at it. Kanna: Sure, I don't mind... Kousei: There are all sorts of dishes out there we can't make at the cafe. Kousei: Speaking of which... Is there anything you want to eat? Kanna: Well, let me think... Hmm... I'm fine with anything, really. Kanna: Why are you stuttering? Kanna: I didn't say anything about pasta, did I? Kousei: No. I just thought that seemed like something a girl would like. Kousei: But I suppose we already serve pasta at the cafe. Kousei: Let's eat something else today. Kanna: Good point. Hmm... By the way, what do YOU usually eat for lunch, Takamine-san? Kousei: At school, I usually eat in the cafeteria. Kousei: But before I started working here, I'd just make myself something simple for lunch. Or I'd have ramen, if I happened to be out. Kanna: Ramen certainly is a popular choice. Is it that good? Kousei: Wait, don't tell me you've never had ramen? Kanna: I've had instant ramen, and ramen from Chinese restaurants, but I've never been to a proper Japanese ramen place. Kousei: Hmm... Kousei: Do you want to try going to one? Kanna: But you said you eat it all the time, didn't you? Shouldn't we pick something else? Kousei: I haven't had ramen since I started working at the cafe, actually. Kousei: Besides, after talking about it, I'm kinda craving some noodles now. Kanna: Alright then... We can go with ramen, if that's okay with you. Kousei: Sweet! Kousei: Still, I can't believe you've never had ramen before. Kanna: I've had a few chances to try it... but I've always been a little scared to go inside the restaurants. Kousei: You mean scared of going by yourself? Like with yakiniku places? Kanna: No, not that. What scares me is the thought of getting yelled at for breaking the rules. Kanna: You know how every ramen restaurant has their own house rules, right? Kanna: Some places don't allow you to make phone calls, or whisper, or even eat too slowly! Kanna: If I accidentally broke a rule, all the other customers would get up and shout \"Guilty!\" before beating me to a pulp, wouldn't they? Kanna: Really? Kousei: Yes, really. Kanna: What about that mysterious chant that goes \"noodlesfirmspicydoubleveggyextraextragarlicoil\"? Is that a joke too? Kousei: Er, no. That one's actually real... Kanna: What about being kicked out for not drinking the broth first? Or for drinking the broth, but stirring it with my chopsticks? Or for looking around while I eat? Kousei: Uhh... Kanna: What about that story about the guy who ate the mustard greens??? Kanna: Was that just a joke too? Kousei: How do you even KNOW about that old ramen copypasta?! Kousei: Have you and Mikado actually been to that ramen place or something? Kanna: No, Mikado-san can't handle hot foods. He's got what they call a cat's tongue, after all. Kousei: Well, that makes total sense, seeing as he IS a cat. Kousei: Just don't be too loud and show some common courtesy and you'll be fine. Ramen Shop Keeper: Welcome! Kousei: Ordering's easy. You just put in what you want at the machine here, and it gives you a ticket. Kanna: What do you recommend I get? Kousei: Hmm, let's see. I guess something light like shoyu or shio ramen would be easier for a girl to eat. Kanna: In that case, I'll have a shoyu ramen. Kousei: I'll go with the shoyu too. Kanna: *gasp*! Noodlesfirm-- Kousei: Shh! Stop that! Kousei: They don't do that kind of thing here! Seriously, they're going to think you're screwing with them! Kanna: M-My mistake. I'd better be careful... Phew... Kanna: Where's the plate of mustard greens I'm not supposed to eat? Kousei: They don't have that here either. Kousei: Relax. You don't need to know anything about ramen to eat here. All you have to do is enjoy your food. Kanna: I don't? Thank goodness. To tell you the truth, I'm quite excited. Kousei: No need to be nervous. Go ahead and savor every bite. Kanna: I plan to... Nihihi. Kousei: ...... Kanna: It's here! Thank you very much! Kanna: Would they get mad at me if I took a picture? Kousei: Nah, go ahead. I'd recommend eating it while it's still hot, though. Kanna: Oh, I know. It would defeat the whole purpose of coming here if I didn't eat while it was nice and hot. Kanna: But one photo can't hurt. Just for the memories. Kanna: Ooh, that came out great! Nice! Kanna: Now then, time to dig in. Kousei: Yep. Kanna: Umm... There's no correct order of eating, is there? Kousei: Nope. Eat however you'd like. Kanna: Okay! *blow* *blow*... *slurp*... Mhh! *sluuurp*! Kanna: *slurp*! Mhhhhhh! Kousei: Glad you liked it. Kanna: Nothing feels better than a full belly after a delicious meal! Today was a wonderful day. Kousei: Hey, the day's just getting started.. All we did was eat lunch. Kanna: Oh, that's right! You said you wanted me to go with you somewhere, didn't you? Kanna: Where exactly would that be? Kousei: I want you to go to an amusement park with me. Kanna: No, not necessarily... Kousei: Hm? Kanna: But there certainly seems to be a lot of men and women here together. Is that because... Kanna: All these couples are boyfriends and girlfriends... on Christmas dates? Kousei: Probably. It is the holiday season, after all. Kanna: Oh... I thought so. Kanna: No, this is my first time. What about you? Kousei: I've been a few times. Once or twice with Nozomi... and once for a field trip, a long time ago. Kousei: But this is the first time since I was a kid that I've gone alone with someone. Kanna: ...... Kousei: Alright. Let's go, shall we? Kanna: Huh?! O-Oh, right. O-Of course. That's why we're here. Kousei: Let's just walk around for now. If we see a ride that looks interesting, we can check it out. Kanna: Th-That was terrifying... No wonder they're called thrill rides. I never imagined it would be that steep... Kanna: How do people enjoy themselves on those? For a second there, I thought I caught a glimpse of the afterlife. Kousei: That doesn't sound like a joke, coming from you. Kanna: Urk... My heartbeat shoots up just from remembering how fast we were falling. Kousei: It's probably because you're not used to it. Maybe you'll enjoy it more if you experience it a few more times. Kousei: Wanna try the loop coaster next? Kanna: Twice in a row is too much for me. I might really wet myself. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Wanna try the loop coaster next? Kanna: Were you even listening to what I said? Kousei: I'm kidding, I'm kidding. Kanna: It sure didn't sound like that to me. The look in your eyes clearly said \"That is my fetish.\" Kousei: It most certainly is not. Also, please don't say that in public! People are staring! Kanna: That was the only way I could get you to stop. I really can't stand going on another ride. Kousei: Hmm... Kousei: How about a haunted house then? Kanna: You really ARE trying to make me wet myself, aren't you? Kanna: Sorry to disappoint you, but I'm immune to scary stuff. I'm well aware that there are no such things as ghosts and zombies. I AM a Grim Reaper, after all. Kousei: Good point. Kousei: But everybody knows haunted houses are fake. They're still scary despite that. Kanna: There's no way it could scare me if I knew it wasn't real. Kousei: Oh, really? Why don't we put that to the test then? Looks like there's no line either. Kanna: Let's do this. Kanna: Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh! Kanna: Wh-What WAS that?! That was just cheap! Kousei: Well, well. Where'd all that bravado from earlier go? Kanna: It wasn't the ghosts or zombies that got me, it was those jumpscares! That's cheating! Kousei: Yeah, I guess it's not really the same thing as actual fear. Kanna: Had I known that was their plan, I would've prepared myself accordingly... Kanna: N-N-N-N-No, of course not! Kousei: Then why are you stuttering so much? Kanna: I really didn't wet my pants, I swear! But... it was a bit of a close call. In fact, I'm having a rather hard time holding it in right now. Kousei: Is THAT why you're shaking so much?! We gotta get you to a bathroom pronto then! Kanna: W-Wait! Please, slow down! I really am about to-- Kanna: Ah. Kousei: Akizuki-san?! Kanna: Fooled you, didn't I? I haven't wet myself just yet... Kousei: Was that really necessary?! Kousei: Anyway, the women's restroom is just over there... but there seems to be a line. Can you hold it in? Kanna: I-I'll twy my bwest... Kousei: There's going to be a Christmas parade here later tonight. I guess these people are staking out spots so they can get a better view. Kanna: A parade? In that case, this might be our chance to ride some of the more popular attractions. Kousei: Is there anything in particular you've been dying to ride? Kanna: I wouldn't say I've been dying to ride it, but I would like to try the Ferris wheel. Kanna: Good idea. Let's get in line while we can. "

            "Kanna: I suppose the most important thing is to grind at a slow, constant speed. Though that's more difficult than you'd think. Kanna: I prefer to use a bit less force, but it's really a matter of personal preference. Kanna: There we go. Now that the beans are ground but not too powdery, it's time to measure out the proper amount, then place it into the dripper. Kanna: Next, you want to use some of your hot water to warm up the cup, before pouring the rest into the drip pot, and letting it cool down slightly. Kanna: To be honest, my brewing process hasn't changed all that much from the start. Kousei: But you said it tastes better, didn't you? Kanna: Strange, isn't it? Maybe it's because my pour-over technique has gotten better, now that I have more experience making coffee. Kanna: Alright. Here you are. Kousei: Tha... nks? Kousei: ...... Kousei: O-Oh, really now? Kousei: Oh, er... yeah. I guess I'll try it now. Kanna: By all means. Kousei: *slurp* Kanna: How is it? Kousei: Mhh, it's delicious. It smells amazing, and it's not too bitter either. Kanna: You like it? Oh, thank goodness! Kanna: What did I tell you? It makes a big difference to work the beans gently, adjusting the amount of water needed depending on the bloom. Kousei: R-Right. The beans. It's cute how they bloom and get all swollen. Kanna: What is this about? Kousei: Nevermind. Anyway, it's good. Kanna: Can you taste the flavor of the beans? Kousei: Oh, for sure. The beans are definitely--ahem--very noticeable. Kanna: Umm, is everything alright? Kanna: You've been acting a little strange ever since... Ah! Does my coffee not actually taste good?! Kousei: No, it does. It definitely tastes... great. Kanna: You say that, but it sounded like you had to think about it for a second there. Kanna: If there's something you'd like to tell me, please don't feel shy. Kousei: Err, I kind of can't! Kanna: Don't worry. I can take criticism. Kanna: If there's something wrong with my coffee, you need to be frank with me. The future of the cafe may depend on it. Kousei: ...... Kanna: Y-Yes? Kousei: Coffee beans aside--do you really need to show off your chest beans too?! Kanna: My chest beans? Kanna: Hmm... Kanna: Hmm. Kanna: Ah... Kanna: Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?! Kousei: I mean, I don't want to tell you how to live your life, but do remember, we ARE in the customer service industry. Kousei: That, and umm, I am a guy. Honestly, this is a little awkward for me. Kanna: I-It's not what it looks like! I have a bra on, I swear! Kousei: Then what are those, nipple enhancers?! Kanna: Of course not! Kanna: I'm not trying to look sexy! These are COFFEE beans! Kousei: Exactly where both your nipples are?! What kind of a miracle is that?! Kanna: I know it sounds ridiculous, but it's true! Kanna: I know you're thinking, Takamine-san, but they're coffee beans! Ah! Kanna: But that's not some kind of euphemism, okay?! My nipples are NOT like two dark roasts! Kousei: The thought never even crossed my mind! Kanna: It's not what it looks like! This is all one big misunderstanding! Look! Kousei: Ack?! Kousei: Umm, I can see that. Kanna: I obviously knew a few beans had slipped under my clothes, okay? But since I told you I'd change later, I... I had no idea-- Kanna: I had no idea it looked like my nipples were hard! Kanna: Please don't get the wrong idea! First of all, my nipples aren't even that dark! They're just the right shade of pink! Kousei: I never asked for that information! And why does that even matter?! Kanna: Well, because if I had nipples as dark as coffee beans, you'd... think I play with them all the time! My pure, innocent image would be tarnished! Kousei: And flashing me your cleavage like this doesn't?! Kanna: Okay, so they both do! But I don't want to mislead you into thinking I always p-play with my nipples or anything! Kousei: This entire SITUATION has been misleading from the start! Suzune: What are you guys yelling out here for? Natsume: Did something happen? Mei: Senpaaai! The girls are done changing now! Nozomi: You'd better hurry up and get changed too. Natsume & Nozomi & Mei & Suzune: Ah. Kanna & Kousei: Ah... Mei: What's going on here?! Suzune: Well, well, well. Looks like we stumbled upon something we shouldn't have. Nozomi: Wh-Wha... Wha--?! Y-You and Kanna-san... were in this kind of r-relationship all along?! Natsume: Did you, um, finally decide to take his virginity? Should we leave you two alone? Kanna: I'm not doing anything of the sort! Stop being inappropriate! Natsume: I think you're much more guilty of that than I am. Kanna: You don't understand! I'm merely doing this to protect my pure, innocent image! Mei: By exposing your boobs in a public place?! Wh-What kind of purity is that?! Kanna: I'm not exposing them! Suzune: Then what exactly are you doing? Kanna: Researching optimal coffee flavor! Suzune: By warming coffee beans with your tits? Natsume: Is that supposed to be innovative or something? Nozomi: Kind of like Kopi Luwak? Suzune: More like Titty Luwak, honestly. Actually, on second thought, that's a pretty crappy name. Natsume: I mean, doesn't the Kopi in Kopi Luwak mean \"coffee\"? Nozomi: What are we even talking about now? Suzune: A new kind of coffee that sad, gullible men would pay for. Natsume: If I recall, a single cup of Kopi Luwak can cost upwards of a few thousand yen. At more expensive places, it might even go as high as 8,000 yen. Nozomi: I heard it was expensive, but holy cow! Suzune: You could even charge customers an extra fee to let them choose whose tits warm their beans. Suzune: Though obviously, MY tits aren't anywhere near big enough for the job. Ahahahaha... *sigh*... Suzune: You were all waiting for the punchline about my lack of tits, weren't you? Yeah, yeah. Very original. Haven't heard that one before. Suzune: Anyone who even THINKS about ordering a drink like that should just drop dead... Natsume: Why'd you bring it up in the first place then? Suzune: That's sexual harassment, you know?! I'll take you to court! Kousei: Me?! You're the one who started this conversation! Mei: Nozomi-chan. What's a \"Kopi Luwak\"? Some kind of secret menu item? What kind of kinky service do you get for 8,000 yen? Nozomi: It's just a regular menu item, actually. It's a type of coffee made using beans taken from the droppings of a palm civet. Mei: Scat coffee?! Eek! You're disgusting, Senpai! Kousei: Hold on! I never said anything of the sort! I'm definitely NOT into that! Natsume: Doesn't sound very convincing to me. Kousei: All I wanted was a cup of coffee, but it blew up into a giant fiasco. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Cleavage... Kousei: Argh! Snap out of it! If I keep having these thoughts, I won't be able to look Akizuki-san in the eye tomorrow! Kousei: I need to think about something else--like the menu! Kousei: Yeah, a new menu item... Come to think of it, a coffee made from breast-ly warmed beans... might actually sell pretty well among certain customers. Kousei: Who knows? Maybe her boobs really DID impart some flavor into... No, stop it, Kousei! Stop thinking about boobs! Kousei: The others would never talk to me again if I suggested the idea for real. Kousei: But then again... I could be on to something. Kousei: Nhh... Nghh! Kousei: Alright. Gotta wash my face, have breakfast, then head to work. Kousei: Hey. Kanna: Umm, I'm sorry about yesterday. I shouldn't have lost my composure like that... Kanna: But don't get me wrong! I just wanted to prove that they were coffee beans. Kousei: Yeah, I know. Kousei: But I'll be honest, I'm still unclear on how proving the color of your nipples is supposed to protect your pure, innocent image. Kanna: Isn't there a big difference between dark and pink nipples?! Kousei: Well, some people say they get darker the more you touch them... But some people are just born with them that color. Kanna: I guess that's true. Kousei: Anyway, this probably isn't a conversation we should be having first thing in the morning. Kanna: Y-Yeah. But let me apologize for yesterday once last time. Kousei: It's all good. Kousei: And for the record, I really did think your coffee was delicious. Kousei: I'd love to have some again sometime. Kanna: It'd be my pleasure! Kanna: Ah--but I'm not going to use my breasts to warm up your beans this time, got that? Kousei: ...... Kanna: Why aren't you saying anything?! You're making it seem like you were actually hoping I would! Kousei: I mean, I know it couldn't possibly affect the taste of the coffee... but I do kinda wanna try it. Kanna: ...... Kousei: Come on. Why aren't you saying anything? You're making it seem like you actually think I'm a creep or something. Kanna: I hate to break it to you, but that WAS in fact a very creepy thing to say. Kousei: Hold on. I didn't mean it in a creepy way. Kousei: I'm just saying I'd try it if the opportunity presented itself to me. Purely out of curiosity. Kanna: Anyway, I'd be happy to make you a coffee anytime. Suzune: Looks like things have calmed down a bit. Kousei: Yeah. Suzune: Why don't you take a little breather while you have the chance? Kousei: As much as I'd like to--there's a new dish I want to try my hand at making first. Suzune: Oh? Finally came up with something, huh? Kousei: It's not exactly an original dish, though. Kousei: Anyway, I'd like to get your opinion on-- Kousei: Oh, Hiuchidani-san! Mei: Eep?! Kousei: You don't have to act so frightened of me... Mei: S-Sorry. I know it was all a misunderstanding yesterday, but still... Kousei: Well, whatever. You haven't had lunch yet, have you? Kousei: There's actually a new dish I want you to try. Mei: A new secret menu item?! Kousei: It's not secret!  Kousei: There's nothing shady about it, okay? It'll be a regular menu item! Kousei: Anyway, I'm going to cook it now, so I'd like you to try some. And it's nothing weird, I promise! Mei: W-Well, okay. Kousei: Omelette alla carbonara... Or a carbonara topped with egg, alternatively. Mei: Oh-ho. Suzune: Huh. It's a simple dish, but people who like it can't get enough of it. Suzune: And we already have all the ingredients, so we can add it to the menu whenever we want. Kousei: See? I told you it wasn't anything weird. Suzune: I watched him cook it too, so you don't have to worry. Mei: Alright then. Let's try this. Mei: Ah... Ahmph... Ah, this is pretty good. Kousei: Really? Mei: Yeah. It's good--but, uh... Kousei: But what? Mei: To be honest, it really does just taste like carbonara topped with an egg. Suzune: Let me try some. Ahmph. Suzune: Hmm. I have to agree. Since you wrapped it in an egg, it might be a good idea to use a different sauce than the regular carbonara. Kousei: I guess it feels a bit too cheap, huh? Mei: But it really does taste good. I wasn't lying. Suzune: Yeah, it's not bad, per se. I'm just saying you could improve it with the sauce. Mei: Senpai, you said I could have this for my lunch, right? Kousei: Yeah. Mei: Great! Then don't mind if I do! Kousei: Go ahead. Mei: Thank you very much! Kousei: ...... Kousei: Thanks. I'll keep working on the sauce. Kousei: I'm open to any other advice you have for me. Suzune: I know. Suzune: But really, there's not much I can say. You'll have to figure it out through trial and error. Kousei: I'll try my best. Suzune: Yeah, I know. Just keep at it. Kousei: I will. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Well, whatever. Kousei: The last time I did something like this... was ages ago. Kousei: Back when Mom was still alive. "

            "Mikado: I am pleased to report that our sales have been steadily increasing. Especially over the Christmas holidays. Kanna: Our sales were record-high! Natsume: I never realized how important seasonal events were. Seeing how successful our Christmas campaign was made me think about doing something for New Year's too, but-- Mei: Oh? What did you have in mind? Natsume: On second thought, we'd get a reputation as a scummy workplace if we made our employees work on Christmas AND New Year's. Kousei: Well, scummy rhymes with yummy. Natsume: Excuse you? Kousei: Nothing. Just forget I said anything. Natsume: What is it with you and making stupid jokes? Kousei: I'm sorry. Just ignore me. Kanna: He definitely has a strange habit of making unfunny jokes. I'm reminded of the whole \"dude\" incident. Kousei: Wh-Why do you still remember that? Nozomi: What's this \"dude\" incident you're talking about? Natsume: This one time, he thought it'd be cool to end all of his sentences with \"dude.\" Kousei: Agh! Stop! Please! I'm sorry! Suzune: Tell me about this later. I want all those juicy details. Natsume: Sure. Kousei: Oh, come on! Natsume: Anyway, enough about Takamine-kun. Sumizome-san? Nozomi: Yes? Natsume: Your family runs the nearby shrine, don't they? Nozomi: Yeah, they do. Natsume: Just out of curiosity, does your shrine do any sort of special event for New Year's? Nozomi: Hmm. Well, we do serve holy rice wine and host a special dance performance. Also, let me think... Mei: Do you do fortune telling? Nozomi: Oh, we do that all year round. But I guess we do get a lot more people doing it during the new year. Natsume: Hmm. I wonder if we could do something similar? Suzune: You mean like selling fortune cookies? That could work. Suzune: I've always thought it was a little unhygienic to put the fortune IN the cookie, though. Maybe we could have our customers draw their fortunes from a box, instead. Natsume: Oh, good idea. Would it be alright if we talked this over some more later tonight? Suzune: Sure. Kanna: I'm glad to see you so enthusiastic about work, but remember to take breaks too. Natsume: I know. Sorry. Kanna: At this rate, we'll be standing around talking all night. Why don't we call it a day? Kanna: Happy holidays, everyone. Suzune: Do you wanna come to my place after this, Natsume-san? Natsume: Would that be alright? Suzune: Sure. Not like I'm gonna be doing anything else anyway. Natsume: Alright. Thanks. Suzune: You can walk back with us too, if you want, Nozomi-san. Kousei, you take Mei-san home. Nozomi: See you later, Kousei-kun, Mei-chan! Happy holidays! Mei: Happy holidays! Mei: Sorry. Feels like you've been having to walk me home all the time this past week or so. Kousei: It's no big deal. Your house isn't that far, and it's dangerous for you to be walking alone at night anyway. If anything, I should've been doing this from the start. Mei: Ehehe. Thank you. Mei: By the way, do you have any plans for New Year's, Senpai? Kousei: Probably just gonna chill in my apartment the whole day. Mei: No family gatherings or anything? Kousei: Nah. I'd go see my dad, but I doubt he's coming back for New Year's. Kousei: What about you? Mei: I'm going to my grandparents' house on the 31st, and I'll probably stay there for a couple days. Mei: My relatives always get together to eat the soba noodles that my grandpa makes. Kousei: Oh, that sounds nice. Mei: If you're celebrating alone, I guess you're probably not gonna eat any osechi? Kousei: Nozomi usually brings me some, or invites me to eat with her family. Mei: Oh. You guys are pretty close, huh? Kousei: Yeah, though I always feel like I'm imposing, since the New Year is usually a really busy time for them. Kousei: So this year, I was just planning to laze around at home by myself. Mei: I'll have to message you a lot on Lime so that you don't get TOO bored. Kousei: I thought you were going to be celebrating with your relatives? Don't waste your time messaging me. Mei: I'll have plenty of time. It's a lot more fun talking to you than with my relatives, after all. Kousei: O-Oh, well if you say so. Kousei: Not if I message you first. Mei: Ahaha! We'll see about that. Mei: Anyway, thanks for walking me home, Senpai. Kousei: Don't mention it. I'll see you next year. Mei: Yep! Happy holidays! Kousei: Happy holidays. Kousei: What? Mei: To be honest, I was already halfway here when I realized I forgot to text you... Kousei: Oh, okay. Well, come on in. Mei: Excuse me! Kousei: Sorry about the mess. I didn't have time to clean up. Mei: No worries. It's my fault for dropping by on such short notice. Kousei: Make yourself at home. I'll get you something to drink. Mei: Actually, I already bought us drinks from the convenience store. Kousei: Oh, thanks. Appreciate it. Mei: Phew! It sure was cold out there. Kousei: Happy New Year. Mei: Here's to another great year! Kousei: Yep. Mei: It's nothing much, but please accept some of my grandma's homemade osechi as a gift. Kousei: Oh, thanks. Do you mind if I eat some right now? Mei: Go right ahead! I brought you some disposable chopsticks too. Kousei: Thanks. Mei: And for drinks, I've got green tea and red tea. Which one would you like? Kousei: I'll have the green tea. Mei: Sure. Here you go. Kousei: Thanks. You're always so thoughtful, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Ahaha! You're about to take that compliment back. Kousei: What do you mean? Mei: You'll see. Now go on and eat. Kousei: O-Okay. Kousei: There's only kelp rolls in here! Mei: Ahaha... I know. Those are actually my favorites. Mei: My grandma makes a ton of them every year because she knows I like them. Mei: But this time, I just couldn't finish them all... Mei: So I decided I'd share them with you instead! Mei: Sorry. I know osechi are supposed to have a lot more variety. Kousei: Oh, that's fine. It's the thought that counts. Mind if I go ahead and eat? Mei: Be my guest! In fact, I'll join you! Ah--you might find the stuffing a little odd, though. Kousei: Odd in what sense? Mei: Normally they're supposed to be stuffed with fish, but my grandma likes to use meat instead. Mei: Not to mention carrots, burdock roots, and other veggies. Kousei: That doesn't sound too bad. Let's see. Mei: I'm glad you like them! Did I mention they're my favorites too? Down the hatch! Mei: Mhhh! Shoo good! Kousei: Your grandma must be an amazing cook, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Yep! There's nothing like mom's cooking. Or grandma's, in this case. Mei: But maybe it's because they look so plain. My other relatives never touch these kelp rolls. Mei: I always end up being the only one who eats a lot. Kousei: That's probably why she made you so much. Mei: If only I had a bigger stomach, I'd be able to eat them all... Sorry, Grandma. Mei: Oh, but don't force yourself to eat them all either, Senpai. If you can't finish them, I'll just bring them home. Kousei: Actually, I'm starving. I can probably finish off the rest myself. Mei: Were you about to make lunch? I saw a bunch of ingredients laid out in the kitchen. Kousei: Hm? Oh, nah. I was trying to think up some new dishes for our menu. Mei: Wow. Eager beaver, huh? Kousei: Hmm... Not exactly. It's more like... Kousei: ...... Kousei: Remember what I told you on Christmas about my soul? Mei: Yeah. You said you had a problem with it. Kousei: Right. Apparently, I'm unsatisfied with my current life. Kousei: Honestly, I can't say I've consciously thought that myself... but because my soul isn't satisfied, it's been attracting butterflies. Mei: Hmm... Kousei: Thanks to Akizuki-san's intervention, my soul is okay for the time being. Kousei: But also, my soul apparently absorbs these butterflies as well. So even if I were attracting them, you probably wouldn't see them. Mei: Huh. Interesting. Kousei: So, in short, that tendency of my soul to absorb butterflies is the problem. Mei: Oh, okay. Because then the Grim Reapers can't collect them, just like the ones in my eye. Kousei: Yeah... Pretty much. "
