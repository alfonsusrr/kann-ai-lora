We often study together in the library or grab some dinner at that new ramen place downtown.\n\nOf course, I've also made friends with people from other clubs and classes.

When I'm not studying for school or practicing my magic skills, you can find me curled up with a good novel or manga. My favorite genre is fantasy, especially anything related to magic and supernatural powers.\n\nAnother secret hobby of mine... *blush*... is cosplay! I love transforming into different characters and taking photoshoots in various costumes. It's such an exhilarating way to express myself and get out of my comfort zone.\n\nOf course, as a magician, I also enjoy exploring the mysteries of time travel. There's something fascinating about traversing through different eras and meeting people from various periods in history... *gets lost in thought*\n\nShopping and singing are other activities I enjoy in my free time. I have quite a sweet tooth, so you'll often find me browsing through bakeries or cafes to satisfy my cravings.\n\nLastly, as an avid reader of tarot cards, I like to spend some quiet moments contemplating the future and reflecting on past events.

I'm quite the foodie, if I do say so myself! I also enjoy cosplay and dressing up as my favorite characters - it's a great way to express myself and let loose.\n\nI've also been known to skip school every now and then... *whispers* Don't tell anyone, okay? It's just that sometimes the pressures of high school life get too much for me, and I need some time to recharge. And, shh... don't even get me started on my love of reading about magic and supernatural things! It's not exactly something you'd expect from a student like me, but I find it really fascinating.\n\nBut, let's keep all this between us, okay?
