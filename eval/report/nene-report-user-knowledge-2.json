Better stop before you say anything more. It's for your own safety. Shuuji: ...Right.  Wakana: I don't know that. She just asked me to give it to you. I'm actually curious about that myself. What the heck did you do? Wakana: She actually seemed pretty serious about it. Do you know anything at all? Shuuji: Nope. I've barely even talked to her.  Wakana: Hrrmm... Well, that's it from me. Good luck. Shuuji: Good luck... With what, though... Touko: Umm, hello? Shuuji: Huh? Ah, yes? Touko: Are you here for the OC? Oh, maybe you want to join? Shuuji: No, that's not it. I just to talk to someone in it.  Touko: So Ayachi-san? Oh, are you maybe here to ask her out? I bet that's it. She's so cute! Shuuji: N-No. Nothing like that. Touko: Really? You don't have to hide it from me, you know. You won't hear a peep about it coming out of my mouth. Shuuji: I promise it's not a confession. Please, just drop that idea, Togakushi-senpai. Touko: Huh? Sorry, this may sound a bit rude... But have we talked before? Shuuji: No, this is my first time. I just know who you are because you're the Student Council President. Shuuji: Ah, sorry, I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Hoshina Shuuji. Touko: Hoshina-kun, eh? Nice to meet you. Shuuji: No, it's nothing. Touko: So what's the call? Are you going in or not? I need to go in there myself, so I'd appreciate it if you could make your choice quick. Shuuji: Oh, my bad. I didn't know I was in your way.  Touko: Oh, no worries. But are you sure you don't wanna go in? Touko: Oh, I know. If you don't want to go in by yourself, would you like to go in together with me? My business there won't take long, so you'll have the room to yourselves. Shuuji: ...I guess I'll take you up on that then. Touko: Aighty! Shuuji: But just for the record, I'm not asking her out.  Touko: What's there to be so embarrassed about? Having a girl you like is a wonderful thing. Touko: I'm coming in. Touko: Hello, Ayachi-san. Nene: Ah...! Oh it's only you, Togakushi-senpai. Touko: Oh-hoo, what was that I heard? Quiiite the interesting response there. Were you expecting somebody else?  Nene: Well, umm... Touko: Was it maybe Hoshina-kun here? Nene: Ack! Nene: Wha, wha, whaa―! Touko: Mufufu... Come on, Hoshina-kun, step on in. You needed to talk to her, right? Nene: H-Hoshina-kun...! Touko: Could I steal a weensy of your time before you get to talking with him? There's something I need to tell you. Nene: Ah... Y-Yes. It's about the clubroom, I'm assuming? Shuuji: The clubroom...? Nene: Alright, I understand. Thank you for conveying this to me. Touko: Alright. That's all I have to say. Big sis here now will leave you two kids to yourself. Mufufu. Shuuji: Look, I keep telling you, that's not what this is about. Touko: Bye now～ Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Err... uhh... Umm, so Ayachi-san. Kariya gave me a letter and said it was from you, but I just want to check: You did mean it for me, right? It's not some mistake, is it? Nene: Yes, that's right. Shuuji: It's... not part of some dare either, right? Nene: A dare...? What do you mean? Shuuji: Ah, no, forget it. I guess it wasn't.  Nene: Well, just out of curiosity, are there any emotions you feel when you see this room? Umm, does it strike you as nostalgic or anything like that? Shuuji: ......? Not sure what to say... Nene: ...I should've known better.  Shuuji: ......? Shuuji: Sure, what is it? Nene: There's actually, umm... Something I would like for you to watch. Shuuji: You want me to watch something...? What? Nene: P-P-P-P-Please watch me... Shuuji: Watch you? Nene: Please watch me pleasure myself! Shuuji: ......... Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: ... Shuuji: Could you repeat that...? Nene: L-Like I just said... W-Watch me... touch... Watch me pleasure myself! Shuuji: ...Huh? Are you talking about... What?! Nene: Masturbation! Touching myself! Self-stimulation! I can't believe you pretended you didn't hear me just to make me say those things! You're such a meanie!! Shuuji: It's not that I didn't hear you, I was just in UTTER DISBELIEF! Shuuji: Wh-Why?! Like MASTURBATION masturbation?! Are you serious?! Nene: I'm at my wit's end here! This is my only option now... I have to masturbate in front of you... Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Not even normal masturbation, but TABLE HUMPING?! Shuuji: Stop, please! You shouldn't be doing this!! Nene: A-Am I not attractive enough for you?! Is someone like me not worth seeing masturbate...? Shuuji: Er, umm... Nene: %130;―Okay I'm doing it! Shuuji: How desperate ARE you?! Shuuji: Look, just wait one minute! Calm down! Take a few deep breaths!! Nene: Let go! Let go of me!! I have to pleasure myself on this table!! I absolutely need you to watch me masturbate!! Shuuji: There is no rule written anywhere that says that!! Shuuji: Seriously, just please calm down! If you need someone to talk, I can listen!! Please, Ayachi-san!! Shuuji: ...... Nene: ...Please, don't look at me like that.  Shuuji: Er, I'm not trying to... Nene: I know, you think I'm sick... I'd much rather die than have someone look at me like I'm some sick, sexual pervert... Please, just kill me now... Shuuji: Ayachi-san, you're scaring me! Please, just calm down! Nene: Ayachi-san... Ayachi-san... Of course you wouldn't call me by my name. Shuuji: Huh? You want me to call you by your name? Nene: Nevermind. Please, just forget I said that. Nene: Also, if you could... please forget about all the stuff I said about... masturbating and the like. Shuuji: Everything alright? If you're going through some problems, I don't mind listening.  Nene: Nnh! Nene: I-It's not how you think it is. I'm not really troubled by anything or stressed... I-I have... reasons. Special circumstances due to being a girl.  Shuuji: ...Special circumstances, you said? Shuuji: Ah, of course I also won't tell anyone about what happened today. I promise. Nene: Th-Thank you...  Nene: Well, err... The main reason I called you here was for... the masturbation stuff. Shuuji: So, we both just forget that happened. Alright with you?  Nene: Y-Yes. I'd like that. I'm so sorry for startling you. Shuuji: That's fine... Shuuji: Well, okay, probably not. I don't know if I should say this, but, um... You probably shouldn't say things like that to others.  Nene: I know that! I've never said those indecent things to anyone else... Just you... Shuuji: ...Yeah, um, I guessed as much. Shuuji: So... Is there any way I can help you? Shuuji: Sure... But what do you want to talk about with me?  Nene: Anything. Just normal, everyday topics are fine by me. Shuuji: ...Okay, then. Nene: Thank you. Shuuji: Thanks. Nene: It's a blend. I'm glad I remembered what you liked... Shuuji: Huh? Nene: Ah, forget that.  Nene: Huh? Ah, r-right... Would you mind, say, telling me what your favorite foods are? Shuuji: Sure, I don't see why not.  Shuuji: Oh, no thanks. Four cups is enough for my stomach... Nene: Ah, no, please wait! Just one more cup is all― Shuuji: But― Nene: Nnh―――! Shuuji: Are you... No, I guess you aren't. Want me to go fetch some salve or something from the infirmary? Nene: I-I'm fine... Ugh, it hurts... Nene: I'm sorry... Shuuji: I just hope nothing's broken. Shuuji: ...I'm sorry, Ayachi-san! I know this might be a rude question, but I need to ask it anyways.  Shuuji: Have you and I met before? It feels like we have, but I can't seem to remember a thing... Nene: E-Err... umm... Nene: W-Would you believe me if I said... I knew you in a previous life?  Shuuji: Huh... Shuuji: I guess I'd just be like, \"Yep, she's not in the Occult Club for nothing.\" Nene: ...Sorry, just forget I said that. I was just attempting a joke, but I see you didn't find it very funny.  Nene: The two of us met here at Himematsu Academy for the first time. Nene: Ah, that's something very important of― Shuuji: Huh... What's up with this? It's shining?? Nene: ...Huh? Wh-What is it... H-Huh?! Nene: I don't know... It's the first time I've seen it shine like that... Shuuji: Wait, really? Then why is it―Whoa?! Nene: Ahh! Nene: \"I just don't know how to describe these feelings... I've never had them before, ever.\" Nene: \"I... I love you. I'm madly in love with you, like you are with me. So much so that I spend every hour of the day thinking about nothing but you!\" Nene: \"Well... ugh... urgghhhh... That would be embarrassing... But I don't want to move from this place right now. That's more important.\" Nene: \"It may take a bit of time... But I swear to you that I'll find you and make you happy. We'll both smile again, together, from the bottom of our hearts.\" Nanao: ...... Nanao: My answer is no. There's no way I'm assisting you with such a pointless gamble.  Shuuji: Souma-san... Nanao: If you want to gamble, at least go with something that's possible, even if the odds are against you. I'd be willing to assist you with something like that. Shuuji: ...Huh? What are you... trying to say? Is there a way? Nanao: Yes, but I wouldn't recommend it. Seeing how desperate you are... Chances are high that a hole will reopen in your heart once Nene is gone.  Nanao: And if that happens... You might not be able to fix it this time around.  Shuuji: A hole in my heart from Nene's disappearance... Would that be something worse than the first one I had? Nanao: ...... Shuuji: So that means there's a point in taking the fragments from me.  Nanao: There is, however, a possibility that your heart could tear in two from it. Neither is really better than the other; they each are exceedingly dangerous.  Nanao: But I'm guessing if the risk is the same regardless... You'd rather choose the option with a glimmer of hope, yes?  Shuuji: Of course! Is there an option like that?!  Nanao: Think back to the event that ultimately led to you helping Nene with her witch activities. Shuuji: ......? Nanao: You see what I meant? That's exactly it. Nene won't ever have any heart fragments with her when she goes to the past. In which case, we just have to give her some to take with her.  Shuuji: So, essentially, the idea is to have the me in the world Nene goes to absorb the fragments of the me from this world?  Nanao: If that happens, you may be able to reunite. But, to be frank, that in and of itself is a gamble. Nanao: If your heart tears, Nene might come to regret her actions for the rest of her life. It could lead to her wishing she'd never met you.  Nanao: Plus, there's no telling if the other you will take the fragments. Just like how the dynamics of Nene's family will change, you yourself might have come to accept your ability by that point in time.  Nanao: If that happens, you might not even have a hole in your heart. You'd just reject the fragments altogether.  Nanao: There are an infinite number of hypotheticals involved. The odds really are that poor. So do you still want to― Shuuji: I'll still go through with it. Please give me your assistance, if possible. Nanao: ...... Nanao: Fine.  Shuuji: \"I wouldn't be able to help her and comfort her if that happened.\" Shuuji: \"I want her to find happiness. She's suffered long enough. She deserves enough happiness to make up for those years of pain and solitude.\" Shuuji: \"And if at all possible, I want to be the one that brings her that happiness.\" Shuuji: ―Aah! Hah...! *pant*... *pant*... Nene: Are you alright, Shuu―Hoshina-kun? Shuuji: Yeah, I'm good... Well, on second thought, maybe not... ugh... My head freaking hurts... Nene: Okay, but if you feel in pai―Wait, what? Shuuji: I really do owe you an apology. I've hurt you, Nene, and it went on for far too long. Nene: Did you just... call me Nene...? Shuuji: Ah, and I guess I oughta apologize for this too. Turned it to complete rubbish now.  Nene: ...Huh? Shuuji: I used the fragments inside of it to seal the hole in my heart. They became a part of me.  Nene: Huh? Ah, then... Huh...? What?? Hoshina... kun? Shuuji: You can call me \"Shuuji-kun\" if you'd rather do that... I'd kind of like you to, honestly. Nene: Does that mean you're... Shuuji: It's all come back to me. Well, that might not be the right way to put it. It's all kind of jumbled together... I feel like me, but not me at the same time... It might take a bit of time to get used to, but I think I can do it.  Shuuji: I'm not the exact same as the other me, but I know everything he did. I have all the memories of us together within me. Shuuji: I remember all the fun we had together... But I also realize the pain I put you through all these years... I'm so sorry, Nene. Nene: ...Ah... ah... Shuuji: But there's still one thing... I have left to find out. So would you mind telling me, Nene? Shuuji: Were you able to find the happiness you wanted?  Nene: That... goes without saying. You know the answer to that full-well.  Nene: I never had happiness, not even for a moment! Nene: I was all alone for so, so long! I was afraid I'd lost you because I messed with the future too much... That's why I held it all in, did everything I could, but for what gain...? Nene: Everyone around me found the happiness they were searching for, but I had nothing... Nene: And when I finally found you, you didn't notice me, completely ignored me, and when I finally got to talk to you, you looked at me like some deviant! Shuuji: You're the one who said something so ridiculous, Nene! Nene: What else was I supposed to do! Shuuji: Come on now, don't cry.  "

Hah...! *pant*... *pant*... Nene: Are you alright, Shuu―Hoshina-kun? Shuuji: Yeah, I'm good... Well, on second thought, maybe not... ugh... My head freaking hurts... Nene: Okay, but if you feel in pai―Wait, what? Shuuji: I really do owe you an apology. I've hurt you, Nene, and it went on for far too long. Nene: Did you just... call me Nene...? Shuuji: Ah, and I guess I oughta apologize for this too. Turned it to complete rubbish now.  Nene: ...Huh? Shuuji: I used the fragments inside of it to seal the hole in my heart. They became a part of me.  Nene: Huh? Ah, then... Huh...? What?? Hoshina... kun? Shuuji: You can call me \"Shuuji-kun\" if you'd rather do that... I'd kind of like you to, honestly. Nene: Does that mean you're... Shuuji: It's all come back to me. Well, that might not be the right way to put it. It's all kind of jumbled together... I feel like me, but not me at the same time... It might take a bit of time to get used to, but I think I can do it.  Shuuji: I'm not the exact same as the other me, but I know everything he did. I have all the memories of us together within me. Shuuji: I remember all the fun we had together... But I also realize the pain I put you through all these years... I'm so sorry, Nene. Nene: ...Ah... ah... Shuuji: But there's still one thing... I have left to find out. So would you mind telling me, Nene? Shuuji: Were you able to find the happiness you wanted?  Nene: That... goes without saying. You know the answer to that full-well.  Nene: I never had happiness, not even for a moment! Nene: I was all alone for so, so long! I was afraid I'd lost you because I messed with the future too much... That's why I held it all in, did everything I could, but for what gain...? Nene: Everyone around me found the happiness they were searching for, but I had nothing... Nene: And when I finally found you, you didn't notice me, completely ignored me, and when I finally got to talk to you, you looked at me like some deviant! Shuuji: You're the one who said something so ridiculous, Nene! Nene: What else was I supposed to do! Shuuji: Come on now, don't cry.  \n\nWhile these examples may provide some guidance, evaluate their relevance to the current conversation.

Yeah. I didn't expect it at all. Nene: I'm very sorry. I should have informed Hoshina-kun beforehand. Tsumugi: You don't need to apologize. There was no time for that since it was just after P.E., right? So... No one is to blame there. Tsumugi: Really, don't worry about it. Actually, umm... Rather than you apologizing, I would like you to forget. Tsumugi: L-Let's just say you never saw anything. Shuuji: Got it. I haven't seen anything. Shuuji: I didn't see you in your underwear at all. Tsumugi: Fueeeeeeaaaahhh! Shuuji: Ahh! Sorry! I didn't mean to say that! I'll forget about it! I'll forget everything! Meguru: I can't tell if you're a pervert or just an idiot! Why would you go in for an extra blow in this situation, super-perv Senpai?! Shuuji: Yeah, I have no excuse. Shuuji: I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Meguru: But why were you changing in the clubroom, anyway, Shiiba-senpai? Nene: I suggested doing so because it looked like she was embarrassed by changing in the locker room. Nene: I already had the key on me, so the clubroom was the first room I thought of for changing in... Shuuji: Why was it embarrassing? You're all girls. Tsumugi: Well, umm... You see, I really surprised everyone when I entered the locker room to change before P.E. Tsumugi: And then actually changing was really embarrassing too. Shuuji: Because everyone was already looking at you? Tsumugi: Partly, yeah... But also, everyone else was able to skillfully change without fully taking off their uniforms. Shuuji: Without taking off their uniforms...? Like how elementary schoolchildren change into swimsuits? Tsumugi: Yeah, right... Shuuji: Girls do that even though it's only other girls in the locker room? Tsumugi: Yeah, they do. Shuuji: Is that common? Nene: Yes. Even when it's with other girls, it's still uncomfortable to be seen half-naked. Meguru: Right. And there's stuff like not wanting to be laughed at for the underwear you're wearing. Shuuji: Is that so? Nene: There's a lot to consider with underwear, such as the comfort level. You tend to wear your most comfortable underwear more often... Nene: But they wear out quickly when you do that, so... Ah! Don't make me say weird stuff like that! Shuuji: No! You did this yourself! Don't blame me for blurting that out on your own! Shuuji: I don't want to know about that kind of stuff, anyway! Tsumugi: But anyway, I can't get around taking off my pants, right? Which is why, umm... I can't avoid letting everyone see my underwear. Shuuji: Well... If you don't take measures beforehand, that's how it turns out, yeah. Tsumugi: Besides, everyone kept looking at me.  Tsumugi: \"She's wearing a boy's uniform, but what about her underwear? Is she wearing a chest binder?\" You could tell that's what everyone was thinking. Shuuji: Yeah, I can see that. Meguru: To be perfectly honest, I've been a little curious about that myself. Tsumugi: I-I'm wearing perfectly normal girls' underwear! I can't show you, though... Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Oh, uh, absolutely nothing! Meguru: But despite that, you ended up experiencing something even more embarrassing... Nene: But you can't keep changing in the clubroom, so we need to come up with another solution. Tsumugi: Right... *sigh* Meguru: Heh heh heh. This is my time to shine. Nene: What do you mean? Meguru: Remember how we talked about changing her hairstyle yesterday? Shuuji: Oh yeah... You mean how changing her hairstyle could change everyone's impression of her? Meguru: Exactly. So, I've already gotten everything ready! Tsumugi: R-Really?! Meguru: Yep! So please, sit down here! I'll do your hair for you. Tsumugi: U-Umm... Okay, thank you so much.

Meguru: Go ahead and touch it yourself, Nene-senpai. Nene: Okay then, if Shiiba-san doesn't mind... Nene: Wow, it really is smooth. How nice... I'm getting a little jealous myself. Meguru: Oh, please. You have no right to be jealous. Just look at how silky your hair is! Nene: Ah, d-don't! It tickles when you touch me there. Meguru: How interesting... Your nape is ticklish, is it? Tsumugi: Fueh? Ah, hey, sto―! Ahhnn! Shuuji: ...... Tsumugi: Geez, knock it off～ Nene: Inaba-san, no means no, okay? Meguru: 'Kay! Shiiba-senpai, sorry about that. I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable. Shuuji: Is it really that smooth? Mind if I― Nene, Meguru, Tsumugi: ...... Shuuji: Ah, right. Of course I can't. I just thought it wouldn't hurt to ask. Don't mind me. Tsumugi: Y-Yeah, okay. Nene: Shiiba-san, are there any specific hairstyles that you would like? Tsumugi: Let me think... Not really. Anything cute will do! Meguru: Anything cute? Roger that! Meguru: Then, I guess I'll go with this accessory... Or maybe this one? Which would look better? Nene: If she wants to look cute, then I would say this one here, no? Meguru: Ah! That one is great! Way to go, Nene-senpai! You have great taste. Tsumugi: U-Umm, I'm not really used to this kind of thing, so I'm kind of uneasy about it. Just take it slow, okay? Take it slow. Meguru: I'm not sure what there is to be uneasy about... But if that's what you want, then let's just go for a cute hairstyle with no accessories. Meguru: ～～～♪ Nene: A braided hairstyle? Like, in pigtails?  Meguru: Right. Some manga have pretty boys who wear braids, so I think it's worth a try. Tsumugi: I've never braided my hair before. Meguru: Don't worry about it. Your hair is long enough, and it's pretty easy to do. Meguru: Just divide the hair into three strands, cross one outer strand over the middle one, then the other, and... Meguru: Voila!

Let's call it a day so you can take it easy. Nene: ...Very well. Thank you for looking out for me. Touko: Helping people is important, but you're not going to be able to help anyone if you get sick. Touko: I'll take over tidying and locking up, so you can go straight home. Nene: ...Are you sure? Touko: Yup, just leave it to me! Nene: Well then, I'll be excusing myself. Thank you, everyone. Touko: Bye-bye～ Make sure you get some rest! Tsumugi: Wait up! I'll go home with you, just in case. Meguru: Oh, I'll come too. What about you, Senpai? Shuuji: I feel bad making Togakushi-senpai tidy up by herself, so I'll stay and help her out. Tsumugi: Bye, then. Shuuji: Yeah, see you later. Touko: See you tomorrow～ Shuuji: ...... Touko: Oh my, what do you mean? I only made a simple observation. Shuuji: You know what you said, and you clearly did it on purpose. Touko: Mufufu. You're blushing, you know? Shuuji: I'm not used to stuff like this... Go easy on me, please. Touko: Okay, my bad. Well, it's getting late, so how about we start locking up? Shuuji: Yeah, let's. Shuuji: But, before that... Could I have a moment? Touko: Of course. There's no rush. Oh, have you decided to talk to me at last? Shuuji: It's more of a request, I guess? Touko: You need something from me? Touko: Oh, is this about your reward? Decided what you wanted, have you? Go on then, let's hear it. Touko: Please, be honest with me. How can I be of service? Shuuji: I'd just like to talk for a minute if you don't mind. Touko: You want to talk? But isn't that what we're doing right now? Or do you mean you want to talk about sex? Like pillow talk? Oh my, you naughty boy. Shuuji: Could you please cut it out with the dirty jokes? Shuuji: I don't want any kind of special conversation. Certainly not one about sex. I just want us to talk normally so I can learn more about you. Shuuji: I mean, yes, there is a reason I want to talk to you, but we don't have to talk about anything specific... A normal conversation will do just fine, really. Touko: You're really serious about this. My bad. I just went and poked fun at you like normal. Shuuji: No, it's fine. I mean, I know this is a bit out of the blue. Touko: What's this about, though? Why do you want to know more about me? Shuuji: Well, you see, errm... There's no big reason behind it. Shuuji: It's just, we're in the same club, but I barely know anything about you. When I realized that, it started to bother me and made me want to do something about it. Touko: Oh, I see. Shuuji: So I just thought we could hang out together a little, or something. Shuuji: So... is that a no, then? Touko: Chatting itself isn't a problem. I don't mind doing that. Shuuji: Oh, well, that's good... Touko: Well, chatting a little isn't much of a reward, is it? It's just a normal, everyday thing. Touko: So it doesn't feel right. Hmm... Oh, I know. Let's go somewhere on our next day off, just the two of us, and talk there. Shuuji: Huh? Just the two of us? Touko: Yeah, that's right. That'll make it nice and easy for us to talk, won't it? Shuuji: D-Do you mean like... Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Yeah, sounds great. Touko: It's settled, then! Your reward for doing a good job with the Halloween party is a date with me. I sound a bit arrogant, putting it that way. Ahaha. Shuuji: N-No, I don't think you did at all. Thank you very much, Senpai. Touko: No problem. Well then, I'm looking forward to our date. Shuuji: I-I'm looking forward to it too. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: A date with Togakushi-senpai... Shuuji: A date... A date, huh? Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Do I even have any good date clothes?! Hideaki: Yo! Shuuji: Hey. Hideaki: What're you doing here so early? Shuuji: Just thinking about things. Hideaki: If something's bothering you, why not go talk to your friends at the OC? Shuuji: If it was a normal problem, I would. Shuuji: But this is a matter of pride. I can't talk to girls about this. Hideaki: Oho. This sounds interesting―no, I dare say fascinating. Hideaki: Well, we're both men here. You can talk to me about it! Shuuji: Huh? With you? Kaidou...? Hideaki: What's with that reaction? Don't talk smack until you try! I mean, the drum thing worked out, didn't it? Shuuji: That's true. Shuuji: You're being awfully nice today. Hideaki: That's 'cause it looks like something's really bothering you. And now I wanna know what it is. Shuuji: You're really enjoying this, huh? Hideaki: Kinda? But I'm pretty worried too. I'm not gonna laugh at you, I swear. I'll just give you my opinion. Shuuji: The whole reason I'm hesitant is that I know you'll laugh at me. Hideaki: A date, huh? I see, hmm... Hideaki: ...... Hideaki: Pfft, ahahahaha! Even middle schoolers don't worry about that nowadays! Ahahahaha! Shuuji: I thought you weren't gonna laugh! Hideaki: Sorry, my bad. Couldn't help it. Just didn't expect you to be worrying about a date. Shuuji: I think a lot of people worry about dates, actually. Hideaki: I went out and bought new clothes and everything for it. But I was wearing stuff I wasn't used to, so it went horribly. Shuuji: So, do you think I should dress up properly for a date? Hideaki: I dunno. Like, obviously you have to pay attention to your looks, but... I don't think you need to dress fancy or anything. Hideaki: Especially in your case, Shuuji. It's not like you're going on an actual date, right? So the rules for a normal date don't apply. Shuuji: Yeah... You're right. "

But someone else did ask me that once. Shuuji: Yeah? How'd you answer? Taichi: I said, \"Let me ask you this: would you prefer me having a job, or being unemployed?\" Shuuji: And then what happened? Taichi: She got really angry and yelled, \"That's not the point here!\" We broke up shortly after. I still don't really understand what happened. Shuuji: You broke up? That's it? Taichi: Yeah. She kept asking me questions like that. Let me tell you, there's no dealing with a woman like that! Shuuji: Yeah... I dunno how I'd think about that. Sounds like it'd be a pain. Taichi: Don't act so picky if you've never even dated anyone. Shuuji: That's harsh, man... Taichi: So, why do you ask? Shuuji: Well, the two of them love each other, but they're struggling to let each other know how they feel. I can't see a solution to the problem. Shuuji: Even if you love someone, you've gotta work, right? But what are you meant to do so that your relationship doesn't fall apart? Taichi: Without just breaking up? Shuuji: Preferably. Taichi: Let's see, then... One thing you could do is take a day off from work and spend that time with your partner. Shuuji: A day off, you say... Taichi: And I don't just mean take them to your work with you. They'd ditch for sure if you did that. Taichi: It's only a temporary fix, but it's a good way to keep both parties happy. Though, the problems will end up coming round again. Shuuji: Yeah... You're right. Taichi: Nothing will change if you keep working the same hours. If it becomes too much of a problem, the two of them are better off breaking up and finding partners who suit their needs more. Taichi: But some people don't want anything to be more important than themselves. That can easily become an irreconcilable difference. It's just who they are, at a fundamental level. Shuuji: Isn't that a little extreme? Taichi: I'm sure even you get lonely and maybe even jealous when you see one of your few friends being friendly with their other friends, right? It's the same in love. Shuuji: Sure, I get lonely, but... jealous? Taichi: Think about if you only had one friend, but that friend had many others. You'd just be one of his many friends. You'd most certainly feel jealous. That's normal. Shuuji: Hmm... Yeah, I guess. Taichi: That's the same kind of situation. If you don't want your partner to be like that, then no amount of talking will fix things. It's a problem with who they are at a basic level. Shuuji: But I doubt you're going to find anyone that perfect, are you? Taichi: Most people get like that, yes. But what's most important is forgiveness and the will to stick together. Shuuji: ...You know, you're pretty smart, Dad. Taichi: Having kids will make you grow up in a hurry. Especially for me, since I have to manage people in my work too. Taichi: Though, I've learned all this after school. It's probably different while you're still there. Taichi: You need to give up on talking this one through. Unless you can change these people's personalities, you're just smoothing over the cracks in the foundation. Meguru: I do! Nene: Okay then, Inaba-san. Meguru: We'll have her confront him! \"Which is more important, me or your team?!\" Shuuji: %130;Are you trying to make things worse?! Meguru: ...Is that a bad idea? Shuuji: Definitely. They'd break up for sure after that! Meguru: Huh, that's weird... It worked in the dating sim I played the other day. I fixed the characters' relationship and got the good ending. Shuuji: 2D and 3D are completely different! Tsumugi: Okay... We could have them set up days with mandatory dates. Like, several times a month. Tsumugi: They have to come to a compromise. Obviously, it's okay for him to focus on basketball, but he needs to spend what extra time he has with his girlfriend. Tsumugi: This way no one has to give up completely on anything, right? Touko: That might work... But don't you think it would put a lot of pressure on Shiba-kun? Shuuji: And wouldn't it be awkward for them to be forced on a date? Tsumugi: Well... I guess. Higo-san might worry about him only being there because he has to. Shuuji: Have your games and manga given you any other ideas, Inaba-san? Ones that don't involve a dramatic confrontation, preferably. Meguru: Errm, let's see... The problem here is that basketball is taking up too much of his time... Meguru: Even though Higo-san's a girl? Touko: She could be the manager. Nene: They would be able to spend time together if she did. Tsumugi: But that doesn't fix their lack of dates, does it? Touko: That's true... Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Actually... Shuuji: That might be a good idea. Meguru: Senpai? Shuuji: The fundamental problem here is that the two of them don't have anything in common that's important to the both of them. Shuuji: Then they'd be sharing a common purpose, a goal they can work together toward. Don't you think Shiba-kun would be happy about that? Tsumugi: She'll start off caring about that one member most, but I'm sure she'll want to support the whole team on their road to the Nationals once she sees how hard they're working. Meguru: I think it's a good idea. Having your girlfriend as your manager, then taking her to the Nationals... That makes for such a good story! Tsumugi: If they agree to this, it would be the easiest solution, right? Touko: But having your girlfriend around might be distracting too. Particularly for his lower muscles♪ Mufufu. Shuuji: ...Togakushi-senpai, a girl your age shouldn't be saying that stuff. Touko: But you're blushing. I bet you're imagining it, aren't you? You naughty boy. Shuuji: I'm not the only one with a red face. Just look at Inaba-san. Meguru: Hey, what are you bringing me into this for?! Tsumugi-senpai's face is just as red! Tsumugi: Whaaa?! D-Don't get me involved too! Touko: Mufufu, maybe you two are just as perverted as him? Meguru: I-I am not perverted! I most certainly am not! Tsumugi: M-Me neither! Anyway, we're trying to solve a problem here! Does anyone have any other ideas?! I think we should go with Hoshina-kun's suggestion! Meguru: N-No objections from me! None at all! Touko: I agree too. Nene: Very well. Then I'll let Higo-san know how Shiba-kun feels and suggest that she joins the basketball club. Nene: Hoshina-kun, Togakushi-senpai, could you go and talk to Shiba-kun for me? Touko: Sure, you got it. Basketball Club Member: Luckily for us, this girl here wishes to be our manager! Student: I'm Higo Mayuko. I'm a beginner when it comes to basketball, but I'll work my hardest to give you all the support you need! Student: But I've never been a manager before... Won't I just get in the way? Shuuji: For the two of them, at least... Basketball Club Member: Now we have double the motivation to win those finals! Basketball Club: Like hell we do! Basketball Club Member A: She's your girlfriend! Basketball Club Member C: Screw this. You're the only one motivated here! Basketball Club Member B: Bringing your love life to the team? Give me a break! Shuuji: The team looks like it's about to collapse... Shuuji: We should have told them that she wasn't becoming a manager just so they'd have more time to flirt... Touko: I think they know that better than anyone, don't you? Student: U-Umm! I plan on taking this seriously and working hard so that you can all get to the Nationals! Student: I've already made some drinks and bottled them up for you. I've also been learning how to bandage and ice injuries. I swear I'll do a great job! Basketball Club Member B: Drinks... A girl's homemade drinks... Basketball Club Member A: Bandaging... Icing... Basketball Club Member C: Skin contact... Basketball Club: Welcome to the team! Basketball Club Member: If any of you get any wise ideas, I'll kick the shit outta you! Shuuji: %130;They're that easy?! Shuuji: Now I feel like they'll break up for a completely different reason... Shuuji: Yeah, you're right. Touko: Love really is amazing. Mm... I'm even more interested in it. Shuuji: Is there anyone you're interested in, Senpai? Touko: Unfortunately not. I've never fallen for anyone before, I'm embarrassed to say... Touko: I called myself a beginner, but I'm actually even less than that. *sigh* I'm completely hopeless. Shuuji: I wouldn't get that down about it... Touko: I mean... I'm starting to worry that I'm simply not capable of love. I'm already this old without having my first love. Touko: I pine after love so badly, but I may never fall in love with anyone... Maybe I'm just destined to grow old and die alone? Shuuji: I don't think that's true. Touko: Really? Shuuji: People like that typically have no interest in love at all. Shuuji: But you're at least interested in love, Senpai, so I think you'll be okay. Touko: I hope you're right... Touko: To be honest, I joined the OC partly because I thought I could learn some more about love by helping people with their romantic troubles. Touko: But it just keeps getting more and more mysterious... It seems like something you have to experience for yourself to understand. Shuuji: Senpai... Maybe you're setting your ideals too high? Touko: Huh? Do I look the type to demand my boyfriend be hot, smart, and earning over a million yen a year? Shuuji: Oh, no, that's not what I meant. I wasn't talking about your ideals for men, but your ideals for love. Shuuji: The woman and her boyfriend that you see in your dreams look really happy, right? Touko: Yes, incredibly happy. Seeing them always makes me envious. Shuuji: Maybe you've seen so much of them that you now think love has to instantly make you as happy as them? Shuuji: That might not be a conscious thought, but something niggling in the back of your mind. Touko: Hmm... I wouldn't be surprised if it was. Shuuji: I'm sure you'll meet the man for you one day, Senpai. Someone who will be even better than your wildest love fantasies. Shuuji: Your love batteries are still charging, is all. Touko: You think so? Thank you. That made me feel a little better. Touko: Are your love batteries charging too then, Hoshina-kun? Shuuji: They certainly are. Touko: Nothing important. I was just thinking about how the two of us are different after all. Shuuji: Huh? You think? Touko: Yeah. Not just with your outlook on love, but with Higo-san's problem too. I never even thought about what was important to them, or if they needed to share something. Touko: I only brought up the idea of her becoming his manager at random. We might both be beginners when it comes to love, but there's still a big difference between us. Shuuji: Ohh, that's what you're talking about... Shuuji: I didn't do anything that great. I'm sure you could have come to the same conclusion if you had a bit longer to think about it. Touko: No way. I would never have thought of that. I'm too boring of a person. Shuuji: You're either being far too harsh on yourself or are way overestimating me here... Shuuji: Actually, I'm sorry! I've been misleading you! Touko: ...? What do you mean? Shuuji: Well, um, you see... Shuuji: All that stuff about what's important to people... I said it like I thought of it all myself, but I was actually just repeating what my dad told me. Shuuji: I was too embarrassed to say I had discussed it with my dad... Shuuji: I know I was overthinking it... But part of me also wanted to seem cool. Shuuji: I had to talk to my dad because I couldn't think of anything, either. So I really haven't done anything special. Touko: I see... That's a bit of a relief. Shuuji: It is? Touko: Yup, it is. I mean, during our date, I told you we were similar, didn't I? Shuuji: I'm sorry. It was all an act. We're similar after all. Touko: We're similar, huh... Shuuji: I'll be honest with you, Senpai... Most days I think to myself about how nice it would be if I had a girlfriend. Touko: ...... Touko: Hey, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Yes? Touko: At the OC we help people with their problems... Is it okay for us to help our fellow club members out when they have a problem? Shuuji: Well... That sounds fine to me. Don't see why it wouldn't be. Touko: Would that include an upperclassman's frivolous worries? Shuuji: It doesn't matter if your problems are frivolous or not. And it certainly doesn't matter if they're older or younger. Shuuji: We've never discriminated over who we help before, and we're not about to start now. Touko: I see... Touko: Then there's something I'd like to ask of you, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: ...Where are you going with this? Touko: Would you study with me? Shuuji: Study with you? I mean, I don't mind, but our midterms only just finished, so... Touko: Not that kind of studying. I'm talking about studying love. Shuuji: ......... Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: ... Shuuji: Come again? Touko: I'm asking if you'll study love with me? Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Whaaaaaaaaa?! "

Shuuji: Ah―――! Nene: Nnnnhhh～～! Nene: U-Umm, since this is a date, we are going somewhere, right? Let's not stand here wasting time.  Shuuji: R-Right! But first we need to get changed! Shuuji: First, we're gonna get on the train. I know last time we only stuck to places here.  Shuuji: So I figured going somewhere else this time would be nice and exciting. Nene: Okay. I'm leaving everything to you. Shuuji: It'd look great on you, I bet.  Nene: No, it would hardly suit me. I'm not nearly cute enough to wear something with that many frills and laces. Shuuji: Oh, don't say that. I know you'd look perfect in it. You're just as cute as that dress is, if not more.  Nene: I-I appreciate it... Nene: But don't say things like that, or you're going to make me blush...! Shuuji: Oh, you wanted to try this place before?  Nene: Yes. A lot of the girls at school raved on about it... But I didn't have the courage to come to a cafe like this on my own... Nene: So I need to thank you. You've made another one of my dreams come true. Shuuji: Glad you're happy.  Shuuji: But how come the pancakes here are so popular? Nene: They taste simply wonderful, that's why. Also, look at how cute they are. Shuuji: ...Hmm. Shuuji: Yeah, just as long as it's not TOO sweet.  Shuuji: Well, that's enough talking; let's try these pancakes.  Nene: You're right. I'll have a bit of mine.  Shuuji: Me too. Nene: Yeah, it's great. It's sweet, and it also feels so light and fluffy.  Shuuji: Hmm, so this is what the legendary pancakes taste like... Shuuji: Oh, right. Do you want a bite of mine? Nene: Huh? You'll let me? Shuuji: Of course. So then... Nene: Wh-What...? You want me to do something that embarrassing in public? Shuuji: You did it that one time before, right? Nene: Urghh...! You want to do that again? Shuuji: Mhm. I'd love to feed you.  Nene: ...Under one condition: I get to feed you a piece of mine afterward. If you agree to that... I'll let you.  Shuuji: Got it. Shuuji: Alright then, say \"aaaah.\" Nene: A-Aaaah... nmh... Nene: Mh... Ah! The taste goes really well with the sourness of the lemon. Nene: Okay, now it's my turn. Here, say \"aaaah.\" Shuuji: Aaaah... Shuuji: *munch* *munch*... Yeah, I like the strawberries and cream on yours, too. Nene: I know―it's very good.  Nene: Thank you for taking me to such a wonderful place.  Shuuji: Glad you enjoyed it... Shuuji: Since I was the one who planned the whole thing this time... I was a little scared you might get bored.  Nene: There's nothing about this I could possibly find boring.  Shuuji: But, well, you can't 100\\% predict what things the other person's gonna wanna do.  Nene: What matters the most is that you're doing them together. That's why I feel so awfully happy right now. Shuuji: Well... Shuuji: ...You're right. I agree. Shuuji: Thank you for coming with me. Shuuji: But, still, you can be honest if you think it's boring. I don't want you to lie about it. Nene: Wouldn't you be able to tell if I lied? Shuuji: Yeah, but I don't want us to have a relationship where we lie with each other. That's not healthy.  Nene: I understand. But no need to worry, I'm not lying at all.

Please don't hesitate to stop by the clubroom again should something else come up. Wakana: Thanks! But I'll be fine. It's just working and earning the money from here on out, after all! Hideaki: ...Umm, may I ask a question? Wakana: Hm? What do you want? Hideaki: What're y'all talking about? And whose clubroom? Wakana: Oh... About that, umm... Do you want me to tell them, Ayachi-san? Nene: I don't mind. As long as you don't thoughtlessly spread it around, you can tell a few people. Hideaki: What's this? Some kind of secret? Nene: Nothing that important. She's talking about me being in the OC.  Shuuji: OC... You mean the Occult Club? Hideaki: Never knew we had a club like that at this school.  Nene: It has been around since before we were here, actually. Though, unfortunately, I'm the only current member.  Hideaki: So with this occult stuff... Are you researching ghosts, or like aliens, or something? Nene: No, I'm doing divination. \"Occult\" encompasses the entire spectrum of the supernatural. Wakana: And she also offers counseling as a bit of a side thing.  Shuuji: So I guess you went and asked for her help on something? Wakana: Yup. Hideaki: Huh. Didn't think someone like you actually worried about things.  Wakana: ...You're the last person I want to hear that from. Wakana: But yeah, it's nothing big really. I just don't have the money to buy something I want. Wakana: And when I went to her for help, she got me this great part-time job.  Nene: You're saving up for a guitar, right? Shuuji: Oh, you can play the guitar? Wakana: I can, actually. Though, I'm not really a pro or anything. Wakana: I found my dad's old guitar a while back, and he's been teaching me ever since. Apparently, he used to be in a band. Wakana: I've been going at it for a few years now, so I've been wanting to get my own, but the one I'm looking at's pretty darn expensive.  Shuuji: And that's why you went to Ayachi-san. I see.  Wakana: Basically, yep.  Hideaki: So you play the guitar, eh? Boy, that sure takes me back. Wakana: Can you play guitar too? Hideaki: If it's just simple chords and crap, yeah. I didn't play the guitar for very long. Nene: Right. You prefer the drums.  Hideaki: ...Huh? Wakana: You play the drums, Kaidou? Shuuji: Seriously? Hideaki: Y-Yeah... I played the drums seriously till about a year ago, during summer. How'd you know that, Ayachi-san? Nene: Ah...! Well, umm... Hideaki: Did you see one of our performances at a club? Wait, no, that can't be it. I definitely would've remembered seeing a pretty girl like you there.  Hideaki: There really weren't a lot of people there... What was it, then? Nene: Well, umm... er, that's... because... m-m-m-m-my divination. I learned that through divination. Hideaki: For frickin' real?! Dang, that stuff is crazy! I always thought it was kinda bogus, to be honest... Never thought you could legit figure out stuff like that.  Wakana: She has a pretty high accuracy rating, or so the girls say.  Shuuji: ...Oh, really? That's neat.  Nene: Umm, if you want to, Hoshina-kun... I could do one for you. Would that be something you're interested in? Wakana, Hideaki: ...... Shuuji: You mean... an actual prediction? Nene: Yes. So, do you want to? Is there maybe something that's been bothering you ever since you were a small child? Shuuji: Nnh―――! Nene: With things like those, it always feels better to talk about it with another person, so if you feel up to it, you're welcome to stop by the clubroom at any time.  Shuuji: ...... Nene: Nothing in particular. I was only proposing a common scenario. There wasn't any deeper meaning to it. Shuuji: Okay, then... Wakana: Did you see something with your divination about him? Nene: You could say so. Nene's Classmate B: Ayachi-saaan! I was gonna ask you something about our math class later on today; could you help me? It's my turn to get called on today. Nene: Ah, sure. Of course. Nene's Classmate B: You're the best! Thanks so much! Nene: Alright then. I'll see you three later.  Wakana: Yeah, bye. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: What can I say... Hideaki: Just make up a problem if you don't got one, sheesh. Just go for the divination so you can spend time alone with her. Man, I can't believe you.  Shuuji: She's helping people out of the kindness of her heart. It just feels wrong to go there with ulterior motives.  Wakana: It's funny you say that, Kaidou, because I didn't see her inviting you. She probably realized how much of a sleazeball you are.  Hideaki: ...Kinda hurts when you say that so bluntly, you know. Shuuji: Ngh―――! Wakana: Hoshina? What're you making that face for? Everything alright?  Shuuji: Ah, yeah. It's nothing.  Hideaki: Yeah, we better.  Wakana: Oh right, there's something I need you guys to do for me. It's about Ayachi-san's club she mentioned.  Shuuji: Ah, didn't she mention she didn't want us spreading it around thoughtlessly? Wakana: Yeah, that's what I was gonna say. Wakana: She's the only one in there, so if word gets out to the whole school, she'll end up swarmed by guys with ulterior motives.   Shuuji: Oh, so guys like Kaidou. Gotcha.  Hideaki: ...Well, I won't deny it. Wakana: So, like I was saying, it'd be a real problem for Ayachi-san if animals like that start barging in her clubroom. Wakana: Plus, like, it'd scare off girls actually wanting to go there for advice, right? So try to keep it to yourself as much as possible.  Hideaki: Sure thing. I won't tell a soul. Hideaki: Means I got an edge over those other guys anyways! Hideaki: Okay, got it. Shuuji: I'll keep my mouth shut too. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: It's no big deal. Girl: Thank you so much. Alright then, good luck♪ Shuuji: See you later.  Hideaki: So you still got roped into doing this, eh? Shuuji: I already said yes, so I can't just change my answer on her now.  Hideaki: Well... I guess that's fair enough. Shuuji: Besides, it's all simple stuff. Don't worry about it.  Hideaki: ...If you say so. But if you ever need me to do something, just hit me up. Wakana: Hoshina, are you sure you don't want any help? Hideaki: Hmm. I guess I can help too, if you want.  Shuuji: I appreciate it, you guys, but I'll really be fine.  Shuuji: You probably have better things to do with your time, anyways.  Wakana: ...Knew you'd say that. Hideaki: You never wanna take help when you get yourself into these situations.  Shuuji: D-Do I? I don't purposely try to... Besides, isn't it only natural for me to not want my friends taking time out of their schedule to help me do something I agreed to? Shuuji: All I'm honestly doing today is entering some data into their database. It's better that I do it alone, if anything.  Shuuji: But, if something like this does happen again, I will come to you guys. Hideaki: You should try not to get into these situations in the first place.  Shuuji: Ah, right. I'll keep that in mind.  Wakana: I'm sure you will. And next time a girl comes up to with something, you'll be too chicken to say no, and then we'll go through this whole thing again. Shuuji: Well, not that I have any problem to come to her with... Shuuji: I've been told to come here and register some new books into the library catalog. Shuuji: Sure.  Committee Girl: Huh? Shuuji: I doubt anyone is gonna come by this late anyway, and I can return the key to the faculty room myself once I'm done. Committee Girl: But... I'm on duty and you aren't even a Committee member... Shuuji: I'm a Library Committee substitute today. It'll be alright. Probably. Committee Girl: You think so? Committee Girl: ...I guess you're right. Okay, here's the key. I'll finish everything else, so just make sure you lock the library once you're done.  Shuuji: Will do. Committee Girl: Could you also turn off the computer before you leave? Shuuji: Oh yeah, of course. I won't forget. Take care on your way home.  Committee Girl: Yeah, thanks! You too. Bye. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Mhh... Now I feel a little bit better. Shuuji: ...That was cringe.  Wakana: \"Hoshina, are you sure you don't want any help?\" Hideaki: \"Hmm. I guess I can help too, if you want. \" Shuuji: They were kind enough to offer... Why didn't I take it? Shuuji: ...If I keep this up, I wouldn't blame them for not wanting to be my friend anymore.  Shuuji: Wait, I can't just bank on something like that happening. I need to put in effort myself. Shuuji: I really need to fundamentally change who I am.  Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: I think I'll come back here on another date. Checking out what kinds of books they have here could be a good way to kill some time.  Nene: I thought this was the right day... Nene: You said you'd fall in love with me... You promised me all I had to do was find you... So why is none of this working out?! Shuuji: Mh... Fuah, aaaaah... Shuuji: Morning. Hideaki: Oh, hey there.  Hideaki: How'd it go yesterday? Shuuji: Pretty swimmingly. I was done with everything before sunset. Akita: Good morning, Hoshina-kun! Shuuji: Oh yeah, hey, Akita-san. Akita: Really sorry about yesterday. I mean, having you fill in for me on such short notice. How'd it go? Shuuji: Great. Finished everything without a hitch, so you're all set. Akita: Wow, really?! Thanks so much! You're the best. Shuuji: Did everything go alright at your thing yesterday? Akita: Yep, you bet! Akita: Ah, right! I baked some cookies as thanks. Here you go! I baked them myself, too! Shuuji: Oh, thanks.  Hideaki: Listen, Akita. I know Shuuji's partly to blame for being such a sucker, but you gotta do these things yourself.  Akita: I know, I know. I apologized to him for it.  Akita: But yesterday really was an important, special day! It was super rare! Like hospital rare! Shuuji: \"Hospital rare\"? Is that your way of saying there was a physician at the mixer? That's pretty impressive. Akita: Ah... Akita: Mixer? What's that? I have no idea what you mean, eheh! Anyway, thanks a lot for yesterday☆ Shuuji: Guess that hospital whatever mixer went great for her.  Hideaki: You could've given her more shit for it, in my opinion... But I didn't like that sarcastic comment you threw in.  Shuuji: I can at least do that. I just hope it teaches her a lesson... But hey, I got some cookies out of it this time, so it's all good. Hideaki: Isn't that just her blatantly showing off, like \"I'm such an amazing, domestic girl☆\"? Shuuji: Doesn't change how happy I was. Hideaki: I can relate. You know they're playing you, but you just can't help but feel glad. Wakana: Morning! Shuuji: Ah, morning. Hideaki: Hey, Wakana-chan. Wakana: What are you guys talking about? Shuuji: The simple-minded nature of men. Wakana: What? Oh, don't tell me... You were talking about naughty topics you don't want a girl to hear about? Hideaki: We guys have our own secrets too. But it wasn't anything sex-related.  Wakana: I don't buy it. Wakana: Hm? What's up? Schoolgirl D: You got someone here to see you! Wakana: Who? Nene: ...... Nene: I need to talk with you about something... Do you have a moment? Wakana: Sure, but what's up? Is it about my part-time job? Nene: No, it's entirely unrelated to that to that... I have a favor I want to ask of you. Wakana: Sure... If it's something I can help you with... Nene: Okay then, umm... Come with me. Wakana: Huh? But the bell's about to― Nene: I promise it won't take long at all.  Shuuji: No idea. Maybe some girls only conversation? Hideaki: Man... That gets me kinda excited. Think it's about a crush? Shuuji: I don't think they're THAT good of friends... Shuuji: Who knows.  Hideaki: What'd she want?  Wakana: Oh, yeah. She just wanted me to relay a message to someone.  Hideaki: Huh? Why would she go to you for that? Wakana: Sorry, I promised not to tell anyone about it. I also can't tell you who the person is.  Hideaki: ...You're just getting me more curious.  Wakana: Oh, look, there's the bell. That means we're done talking here.  Hideaki: Well, shucks. Wakana: Here. For you.  Shuuji: What's this... An envelope? Is there a letter inside? "

Shuuji: Ah, didn't she mention she didn't want us spreading it around thoughtlessly? Wakana: Yeah, that's what I was gonna say. Wakana: She's the only one in there, so if word gets out to the whole school, she'll end up swarmed by guys with ulterior motives.   Shuuji: Oh, so guys like Kaidou. Gotcha.  Hideaki: ...Well, I won't deny it. Wakana: So, like I was saying, it'd be a real problem for Ayachi-san if animals like that start barging in her clubroom. Wakana: Plus, like, it'd scare off girls actually wanting to go there for advice, right? So try to keep it to yourself as much as possible.  Hideaki: Sure thing. I won't tell a soul. Hideaki: Means I got an edge over those other guys anyways! Hideaki: Okay, got it. Shuuji: I'll keep my mouth shut too. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: It's no big deal. Girl: Thank you so much. Alright then, good luck♪ Shuuji: See you later.  Hideaki: So you still got roped into doing this, eh? Shuuji: I already said yes, so I can't just change my answer on her now.  Hideaki: Well... I guess that's fair enough. Shuuji: Besides, it's all simple stuff. Don't worry about it.  Hideaki: ...If you say so. But if you ever need me to do something, just hit me up. Wakana: Hoshina, are you sure you don't want any help? Hideaki: Hmm. I guess I can help too, if you want.  Shuuji: I appreciate it, you guys, but I'll really be fine.  Shuuji: You probably have better things to do with your time, anyways.  Wakana: ...Knew you'd say that. Hideaki: You never wanna take help when you get yourself into these situations.  Shuuji: D-Do I? I don't purposely try to... Besides, isn't it only natural for me to not want my friends taking time out of their schedule to help me do something I agreed to? Shuuji: All I'm honestly doing today is entering some data into their database. It's better that I do it alone, if anything.  Shuuji: But, if something like this does happen again, I will come to you guys. Hideaki: You should try not to get into these situations in the first place.  Shuuji: Ah, right. I'll keep that in mind.  Wakana: I'm sure you will. And next time a girl comes up to with something, you'll be too chicken to say no, and then we'll go through this whole thing again. Shuuji: Well, not that I have any problem to come to her with... Shuuji: I've been told to come here and register some new books into the library catalog. Shuuji: Sure.  Committee Girl: Huh? Shuuji: I doubt anyone is gonna come by this late anyway, and I can return the key to the faculty room myself once I'm done. Committee Girl: But... I'm on duty and you aren't even a Committee member... Shuuji: I'm a Library Committee substitute today. It'll be alright. Probably. Committee Girl: You think so? Committee Girl: ...I guess you're right. Okay, here's the key. I'll finish everything else, so just make sure you lock the library once you're done.  Shuuji: Will do. Committee Girl: Could you also turn off the computer before you leave? Shuuji: Oh yeah, of course. I won't forget. Take care on your way home.  Committee Girl: Yeah, thanks! You too. Bye. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Mhh... Now I feel a little bit better. Shuuji: ...That was cringe.  Wakana: \"Hoshina, are you sure you don't want any help?\" Hideaki: \"Hmm. I guess I can help too, if you want. \" Shuuji: They were kind enough to offer... Why didn't I take it? Shuuji: ...If I keep this up, I wouldn't blame them for not wanting to be my friend anymore.  Shuuji: Wait, I can't just bank on something like that happening. I need to put in effort myself. Shuuji: I really need to fundamentally change who I am.  Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: I think I'll come back here on another date. Checking out what kinds of books they have here could be a good way to kill some time.  Nene: I thought this was the right day... Nene: You said you'd fall in love with me... You promised me all I had to do was find you... So why is none of this working out?! Shuuji: Mh... Fuah, aaaaah... Shuuji: Morning. Hideaki: Oh, hey there.  Hideaki: How'd it go yesterday? Shuuji: Pretty swimmingly. I was done with everything before sunset. Akita: Good morning, Hoshina-kun! Shuuji: Oh yeah, hey, Akita-san. Akita: Really sorry about yesterday. I mean, having you fill in for me on such short notice. How'd it go? Shuuji: Great. Finished everything without a hitch, so you're all set. Akita: Wow, really?! Thanks so much! You're the best. Shuuji: Did everything go alright at your thing yesterday? Akita: Yep, you bet! Akita: Ah, right! I baked some cookies as thanks. Here you go! I baked them myself, too! Shuuji: Oh, thanks.  Hideaki: Listen, Akita. I know Shuuji's partly to blame for being such a sucker, but you gotta do these things yourself.  Akita: I know, I know. I apologized to him for it.  Akita: But yesterday really was an important, special day! It was super rare! Like hospital rare! Shuuji: \"Hospital rare\"? Is that your way of saying there was a physician at the mixer? That's pretty impressive. Akita: Ah... Akita: Mixer? What's that? I have no idea what you mean, eheh! Anyway, thanks a lot for yesterday☆ Shuuji: Guess that hospital whatever mixer went great for her.  Hideaki: You could've given her more shit for it, in my opinion... But I didn't like that sarcastic comment you threw in.  Shuuji: I can at least do that. I just hope it teaches her a lesson... But hey, I got some cookies out of it this time, so it's all good. Hideaki: Isn't that just her blatantly showing off, like \"I'm such an amazing, domestic girl☆\"? Shuuji: Doesn't change how happy I was. Hideaki: I can relate. You know they're playing you, but you just can't help but feel glad. Wakana: Morning! Shuuji: Ah, morning. Hideaki: Hey, Wakana-chan. Wakana: What are you guys talking about? Shuuji: The simple-minded nature of men. Wakana: What? Oh, don't tell me... You were talking about naughty topics you don't want a girl to hear about? Hideaki: We guys have our own secrets too. But it wasn't anything sex-related.  Wakana: I don't buy it. Wakana: Hm? What's up? Schoolgirl D: You got someone here to see you! Wakana: Who? Nene: ...... Nene: I need to talk with you about something... Do you have a moment? Wakana: Sure, but what's up? Is it about my part-time job? Nene: No, it's entirely unrelated to that to that... I have a favor I want to ask of you. Wakana: Sure... If it's something I can help you with... Nene: Okay then, umm... Come with me. Wakana: Huh? But the bell's about to― Nene: I promise it won't take long at all.  Shuuji: No idea. Maybe some girls only conversation? Hideaki: Man... That gets me kinda excited. Think it's about a crush? Shuuji: I don't think they're THAT good of friends... Shuuji: Who knows.  Hideaki: What'd she want?  Wakana: Oh, yeah. She just wanted me to relay a message to someone.  Hideaki: Huh? Why would she go to you for that? Wakana: Sorry, I promised not to tell anyone about it. I also can't tell you who the person is.  Hideaki: ...You're just getting me more curious.  Wakana: Oh, look, there's the bell. That means we're done talking here.  Hideaki: Well, shucks. Wakana: Here. For you.  Shuuji: What's this... An envelope?
