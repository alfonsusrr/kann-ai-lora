We didn't really talk about what happened or anything. It wasn't like we fell out as friends or anything, but... I don't know, it felt like they'd forgotten all about me or something.\n\nBut, anyway... that was probably around the time when I started to realize just how little people actually care about you until something affects them directly.

But, I could tell they were just being polite. They said things like \"Oh, Shiki's fine\" and \"We know she had other stuff going on\", but I'm pretty sure they're still all upset with me for missing the party.\n\nTo be honest, I don't really care if you think this is a trivial matter or not, but it bothers me that people always prioritize their social media posts over actual human connections. Just because we can post pictures of ourselves eating food online doesn't mean it's more important than spending time with real friends. *mutter mutter*"
