            "Kanna: Yes. What can I get for you, ma'am? Housewife A: I'll have the chocolate cake. Housewife B: And I'll have the cheesecake, please. Kanna: Certainly. Housewife A: Oh, but the pancakes look wonderful too. Housewife B: I know! I was eyeing them myself, actually. Housewife A: What's the serving size like for the pancakes? Kanna: Well, a single plate is usually enough to fill up most of our female customers. Housewife B: Okay. Customer A: Excuse me! Kanna: I'll be with you in one moment! Housewife B: Ah! Why don't we split them? Housewife A: Hey, that's a great idea! Housewife A: In that case, we'll have one plate of pancakes along with those other two cakes, please. Also, can I get a house blend coffee as well? Housewife B: Make that two. Kanna: Certainly. Kanna: Thank you for your patience. Have you decided what you'd like to order? Customer B: I'll have a shortcake and a chocolate cake. Oh, and this fruit tart too. Natsume: When would you like your cakes? Customer B: Hmm. In about thirty minutes? Natsume: Understood. Please give a moment. Mikado: Thank you for your patience. Your total comes to 1,340 yen. Customer C: Thank you. Here's 2,000 yen. Mikado: Your change is 660 yen. Thank you for coming. We hope to see you again soon. Customer C: Thanks. Kanna: Mikado-san! I need two blend coffees and a Darjeeling. Also, an Assam tea as well. Mikado: Hmm. Drinks for four... Mikado: If I step away now, though, Natsume may not be able to handle everything on her own. Kanna: Yeah. Maybe we should focus on thinning out this line first. Kanna: Alright. I'll take care of the drinks, so you stay here and keep selling cakes. Mikado: Understood. Natsume: Welcome to Cafe Stella. How may I help you? Kanna: Still... it might take some time to do this all myself. Kanna: Order coming in! I need a plate of pancakes, an omelet rice, and a caprese-style pasta! Suzune: On it! Kanna: Also, I hate to ask--but would you mind helping me making a few drinks? Kanna: I'm afraid my hands are kind of full at the moment. Kousei: We're pretty busy in here too... Is that alright, though, Suzune-san? Suzune: Well, we can't just let her fend for herself. Fine. Go help her with the drinks, Kousei. But once you're done, I need you straight back here. Suzune: I'll try to do as much of the prep work as I can in the meantime. Kousei: Alright. Kanna: Thank you. And sorry for the trouble. Kanna: I'll handle the tea, Takamine-san. I need you to make two house blend coffees. Kousei: Got it. Kanna: I'll be right with you! Kousei: Let me handle this. Kanna: Thank you. Kousei: Thank you for your patience. Yuina: Hello! Kousei: Oh. Why, hello there, Yuina-chan. Yuina: One omelet rice, please! Yuina's Mother: I'm sorry. It looks like we've come during a particularly busy time. Kousei: Oh, that's fine. I'm glad to see you again. Kousei: Do you want your omelet rice thinly-fried like usual? Yuina: Yeah! Also, I want orange juice! Kousei: Of course. Yuina's Mother: As for me... Could I have a pancake and a Darjeeling tea? Kousei: Certainly. I'll have those out to you shortly. Kanna: Yuina-chan came to visit again, did she? Kousei: Yeah. I'd love it if they became regulars from now on. Kanna: By the looks of it, it seems like she already is. Kanna: I bet I can guess what she ordered. Kousei: Yeah. Omelet rice again. Kanna: I suppose that means you'll have to be the one to cook it. Kousei: That's the plan. Kanna: What about the coffee? Will it be ready soon? Kousei: Yeah. All that's left is to add hot water. Kanna: In that case, I'll handle the rest. I've just put on the tea cozies while I wait for the tea to steep. Kanna: Thanks for the help. Kousei: No problem. But you'll have to add two more drinks to the list; an orange juice and a Darjeeling for Yuina-chan and her mom. Kanna: Sure, I'll have those taken care of. Kousei: Sorry about that. I'm back. Suzune: I've finished prepping the pasta for you. You do the rest. Kousei: Got it. Also, we've got a new order. A thinly-fried omelet rice and a plate of pancakes. I'll handle the omelet rice. Suzune: Alright. Suzune: Hmm, guess I'll do the pancakes next. Those dirty dishes are kinda starting to pile up, though. I'd better clean them soon. Suzune: Man, weekend rush is no joke. It's tough without those other two around. Kousei: Well, they've got classes in the morning. Plus their mid-terms are coming up too, so they've gotta study. Suzune: Oh, right. I almost forgot. How're things looking on that front? Think they'll be able to pass? Kousei: From what I can see, they should be fine. Kousei: Or at least, Nozomi should be, since she's always been the studious type to begin with. Hiuchidani-san might have to do a bit of guesswork, though, so I'm not sure about her. Suzune: Gotcha. Kousei: Speaking of which--what were your grades like back when you were their age, Suzune-san? Suzune: I'd already decided to become a pastry chef by then, so I mostly got by with cramming last minute. Suzune: Order up! Pancakes for table two! Nozomi: Okay! Coming! Mei: I'll go relieve Natsume-senpai at the cake display out front. Suzune: Thanks, that'd be--wait, what? Kousei: What are you two doing here?! Aren't you supposed to be studying for your exams?! Nozomi: Don't worry. We're doing fine on that front. Kousei: But-- Nozomi: We both know how busy Saturdays get. I had to come or else I'd feel bad. Besides, look at how much there is to do today. Mei: Did you expect me to just sit by and study quietly in the break room? Hearing how hectic it was outside made it impossible to focus! Suzune: Well, I can get that. Suzune: Sometimes you take the day off, but you still can't stop thinking about work. Happens to me too. Mei: Exactly. Nozomi: That's why we want to get to work. Once things calm down, then we'll go back to studying. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Fine. I hate to say it, but we could use your help. Nozomi: Say no more! I'm taking out the pancakes for table two! Suzune: Come on, stop standing there. We've got work to do too! Kousei: Yes, ma'am! Kousei: Time's up! Nozomi: *siiigh*... Kousei: Alright. Now let's see how you did. Mei: Lay it on me. Mei: This is already the fourth time we've done this test. Nozomi: I can pretty much remember all the answers by now, but I think I'm starting to get WHY they're the right answers instead of just memorizing them--I think. Mei: Yeah. It's pretty crazy how much repetition helps. Kousei: Alright, I'm done grading them. Nozomi: That was quick! Kousei: Well, I've done it four times by now. Anyway, to the results. Kousei: Nozomi, your answers were essentially perfect, but you made a lot of careless mistakes. If it weren't for those, though, you might've gotten a perfect grade. Nozomi: I did try to be careful... but I guess I rushed a bit. Kousei: Also, keep in mind that you go to a different school. The questions on your exam are bound to be different accordingly, so watch out for that. Kousei: By the way, are you feeling alright? This would be a terrible time for you to get sick. Nozomi: Oh, I'm fine. I'm not feeling sick at all. Kousei: Good. Kousei: Now for you, Hiuchidani-san. It looks like you're thinking about question four the wrong way. Mei: Aw, geez. I knew my answer wasn't right. Mei: Thanks to you and Natsume-senpai. Kousei: Either way, I'm confident you aren't going to fail, at the very least. Mei: I sure hope so... Aw, man. Why can't the actual exams just be the same as these? Nozomi: I agree. That would be the easiest solution to all this. Kousei: I can't speak for Nozomi's, but that might be more likely than you think. Kousei: You have the same teacher as Shiki-san, so unless the curriculum's changed dramatically, his tests shouldn't have changed much either. Mei: I really, really hope you're right about that. Natsume: Okay, I'm headed this way. See you tomorrow. Mei: I'm going that way. Good night, guys. Suzune: Alrighty. Time to go home, hop in a hot bath, and crack open a cold one! Nozomi: Drinking alcohol while in the bath is supposed to be dangerous. Suzune: I know. I'll be careful. Nozomi: Huh? Why? Suzune: Well, it is getting pretty dark out. Suzune: I'll see you two tomorrow then. Night. Kousei: Good night. Nozomi: Good night... Nozomi: So, wanna tell me why you're randomly acting so overprotective? Kousei: I don't know; you just don't feel like your usual self. Kousei: You sure you're not working yourself too hard? Nozomi: Do I really seem that out of wack? Kousei: It's not really something visible, per se, like your facial complexion... I dunno. Chalk it up my intuition as your childhood friend, I guess. Kousei: Doesn't seem like you have a fever, at least. Kousei: Which leaves only one other thing... Have you been studying too hard? Nozomi: I mean, I don't THINK so. Kousei: You've been staying up later than usual to study, haven't you? Nozomi: Well, maybe a little. Kousei: Plus you've been working as a waitress too. It's no wonder you seem a bit out of sorts. Nozomi: I told you, I'm fine. Kousei: You call making that many careless mistakes on your test \"fine\"? Nozomi: Urk... Kousei: No more studying for today, alright? I want you to get some sleep. Nozomi: Come on. Kousei: It won't matter how much studying you do if you don't get enough rest. None of it will stick. Kousei: So go home, take a bath or something, and go to bed. Sleep is an important part of staying in top shape. Nozomi: Fine. I'll do what you want. Kousei: Good. Now let's get you home. Nozomi: Okay. Nozomi: Thanks for walking me home. See you tomorrow. Kousei: Yeah. Night. Nozomi: I'm hooome. Nozomi: Phew... Nozomi: Man, I am feeling kind of tired. Nozomi: I must've been accumulating all this fatigue without even noticing it... Not that I haven't been getting ANY sleep... Nozomi: Oh, well. I guess I'll be a good girl and listen to Kousei-kun for once. Time for a bath, then it's straight to bed. Nozomi: Nhh... *snore*... *snore*... Nozomi's Mother: Nozomi! Are you going to sleep in all day? Nozomi: Nh? Mhh? Nozomi's Mother: It's almost nine o'clock, you know! Nozomi: Wuh? Nozomi: Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa--?! Nozomi's Mother: Finally up, are you? What do you want for breakfast? Nozomi: I don't have time for that! Nozomi's Mother: You should at least eat SOMETHING. Nozomi's Mother: You have to get dressed anyway, don't you? I'll make you something in the meantime. Nozomi: Why didn't you wake me up earlier?! Nozomi's Mother: I tried! Don't blame this on me, young lady. Nozomi: I went to sleep so early yesterday! How'd this HAPPEN?! Suzune: I was thinking of going with a Yule Log for our Christmas cake. Kousei: Nice. A classic. Suzune: I don't know how many orders we can expect, so I thought we'd just test the waters this time around. Suzune: Fortunately, it looks like our regular cakes are still going well, so I thought it'd be best to play it safe this year. Suzune: We'll begin taking advance orders starting tomorrow, and go all the way up until Christmas Eve. Kousei: We should probably take a picture of the actual cake before that, though. Otherwise we won't garner much attention. Suzune: I know. I already took some pictures as I was baking the prototype, so we're all good to go. Kousei: Oh. All the better. Kousei: Now we just need to update our social media, start taking orders--Oh, and make some flyers to post around the cafe. Kanna: A Yule Log sounds like a fine idea. Mikado: If it won't interfere with your work, then I have no objections. Natsume: Me neither. I'm just worried that we'll have to set a limit on the number of orders, but I guess we'll have to wait and see. Natsume: Though I highly doubt we'll be flooded with hundreds of orders per day. Kousei: Hopefully not. But yeah, we'll have to wait and see before we can say for sure. Mikado: It seems that we'll need all hands on deck for both Christmas Eve and Christmas Day... Mikado: But aside from Kanna--Natsume, Nozomi, and Mei are all young maidens, so I would hardly be surprised if they had one or two dates already planned on those days. Natsume: You're doing that on purpose, aren't you? Natsume: Of course I don't have any plans. For one thing, I'm busy with work almost every day. Kousei: Nozomi doesn't have a boyfriend either. Kousei: Hiuchidani-san also doesn't... to my knowledge, but we should ask just to make sure. Kanna: Wait a minute. Why'd you exclude me from that list? Isn't that a little rude? Mikado: As far as I am aware, you have no boyfriend either. Kanna: That's not what I'm talking about! You totally excluded me from the \"young maiden\" category! Mikado: How long have you and I been together now? Kanna: Well, sure, I have been working alongside you as a Grim Reaper for many years now... Kanna: And in all that time, I've never been in a relationship, shared a kiss, let alone had sex. Kanna: Both my mind and my body are pure as virgin snow! If that doesn't make me a maiden, then what does?! Mikado: The fact that you can say all of that without even a hint of shame only proves my point. Mikado: If you wish to call yourself a maiden, then have some more modesty. Kanna: I am modest! You're making me sound like some sort of pervert... Nozomi: Um, good morning. Kanna: Good morning. Natsume: Good morning. Mikado: Good morning. Kousei: Hey, Nozomi. You're a bit late today. Nozomi: Sorry. I overslept a bit... Ehehe. Natsume: Did you stay up late again? Nozomi: Actually, as a matter of fact, I went to bed earlier than usual yesterday... Kousei: What'd I tell you? That just means you had a lot of fatigue built up. Nozomi: Urk... I can't argue with that. Kanna: You have been pretty busy these days. Natsume: Your mid-terms start tomorrow, don't they? Maybe you should take the day off today to rest up. Nozomi: Thanks, but I'll be A-OK. Nozomi: I got more than enough rest last night. I'm back in tip-top shape. Natsume: Well, if you say so. Nozomi: I'm gonna go get changed now. Kousei: ...... "

            "Kousei: ...... Kousei: Don't call them just for laughs. I'm sure they're busy. Kousei: Look, I'm not having weird thoughts or anything. I'm just nervous, that's all. Kousei: There's just something strange about seeing you in my room. Natsume: Well, I guess I don't blame you. I'm a little nervous too. Kousei: You are? Natsume: I keep telling myself there's nothing to be anxious about, but this is the first time I've ever been to a guy's apartment too. Natsume: O-Oh! A kotatsu. Nothing beats a kotatsu in the winter, huh? But I have to say, your place is a lot cleaner than I thought it'd be. Kousei: Well, you know. Natsume: I bet Sumizome-san's the one who does most of the cleaning, though. Am I right? Kousei: She used to, but these days, I do it all myself. Kousei: Since she always used to keep everything clean for me, I can't stand leaving things messy now. Kousei: And letting junk pile up just means more work when you have to clean it up later. If I have to spend my days off doing housework, it ends up feeling like I've wasted the day away. Natsume: No wonder you didn't seem fazed when I suddenly asked if I could come over. Natsume: By the way, where do you keep your spices and seasonings? You don't mind if I poke around, do you? Kousei: Most of the stuff I have is in the fridge, or under the sink. Natsume: It's nothing special, so keep your expectations low. Kousei: I don't buy it. This has to be delicious. Kousei: Mhh! This is great! Your ginger-fried pork is something else! So delicious! Natsume: That's laying it on a bit thick. Kousei: No, seriously. I know you told me not to expect much, but this honestly tastes amazing. Natsume: Does it? Well, um, I'm glad you like it. Kousei: Ah, I know. It's a bit sweeter. Kousei: Did you use sugar when making the sauce? Natsume: Nrgh... Natsume: Yes, I did, but it's not because I'm bad with ginger, okay? It's not THAT bitter. Kousei: I know. I wasn't saying it's too sweet. Kousei: In fact, it's just right. You're pretty good at cooking. Natsume: I only cook well enough for myself. I don't know if I'd say I'm \"good\" at it. Kousei: Maybe, but it's far from bad. I'd say your taste for seasoning is pretty sharp. Kousei: Well, except for that time you basically drank a cup of coffee-flavored sugar. Natsume: Tch. Shuddup, will you? Coffee's not the same. You all are the weird ones for being able to drink something that bitter. Kousei: Maybe, but I don't think that much sugar is good for you. Not that you drink it every day, but still. Natsume: Well, thanks for your concern. Kousei: But anyway, this is delicious. Makes me want to try your curry or your Hamburg steak too. Natsume: Now who's got childish tastes? Kousei: I don't wanna hear that from someone who can't eat green peppers. Natsume: Nrghhh... Kousei: I really do want to try your other stuff, though. Natsume: Well, maybe some other time. Natsume: Well, in that case, takoyaki and yakisoba are the simplest things that come to mind. Kousei: Baby castella cakes are pretty easy to make too. Natsume: Simple enough for an amateur to make? Kousei: I mean, probably. With a bit of practice, at least. Natsume: Oh! I almost forgot about the most important thing. Natsume: We also need to think about what our customers would want, and who we're trying to target. People of all ages and genders come to visit the shrine on New Year's, after all. Kousei: That's why stuff like takoyaki is so popular. It's hard to resist the urge when you see them. They're a street stall staple. Natsume: Hmm... But there's no reason we can't compete by selling other staples, is there? Natsume: Festival staples, New Year's staples, winter staples... Kousei: You mean like osechi, or mochi? Natsume: Speaking of winter... For me, it's got to be the kotatsu. Natsume: *sigh*... So warm and toasty. Kousei: Want some tangerines? Natsume: Oh, sure. Kousei: Here. Natsume: Thanks. Nothing says Japanese winter like a kotatsu and tangerines. Kousei: Now that you mention it, we should probably sell something that'll warm people up. Natsume: Something warm... Like hot pot? Or oden, or maybe miso soup, or pork soup. Kousei: It needs to be something people can eat while walking, though. Kousei: Hmm. What about roasted sweet potatoes? Natsume: Maybe Suzune-san could use them to make some kind of cake, like for a January special? No, but then we might not have enough potatoes... Kousei: Plus the variety of potato we use for roasting might not be the best for making sweets, either. Kousei: Hmm. I always see it in the hot foods section at the convenience store, yeah. Kousei: But speaking of convenience store food--what about Chinese meat buns? "

            "Mikado: I am pleased to report that our sales have been steadily increasing. Especially over the Christmas holidays. Kanna: Our sales were record-high! Natsume: I never realized how important seasonal events were. Seeing how successful our Christmas campaign was made me think about doing something for New Year's too, but-- Mei: Oh? What did you have in mind? Natsume: On second thought, we'd get a reputation as a scummy workplace if we made our employees work on Christmas AND New Year's. Kousei: Well, scummy rhymes with yummy. Natsume: Excuse you? Kousei: Nothing. Just forget I said anything. Natsume: What is it with you and making stupid jokes? Kousei: I'm sorry. Just ignore me. Kanna: He definitely has a strange habit of making unfunny jokes. I'm reminded of the whole \"dude\" incident. Kousei: Wh-Why do you still remember that? Nozomi: What's this \"dude\" incident you're talking about? Natsume: This one time, he thought it'd be cool to end all of his sentences with \"dude.\" Kousei: Agh! Stop! Please! I'm sorry! Suzune: Tell me about this later. I want all those juicy details. Natsume: Sure. Kousei: Oh, come on! Natsume: Anyway, enough about Takamine-kun. Sumizome-san? Nozomi: Yes? Natsume: Your family runs the nearby shrine, don't they? Nozomi: Yeah, they do. Natsume: Just out of curiosity, does your shrine do any sort of special event for New Year's? Nozomi: Hmm. Well, we do serve holy rice wine and host a special dance performance. Also, let me think... Mei: Do you do fortune telling? Nozomi: Oh, we do that all year round. But I guess we do get a lot more people doing it during the new year. Natsume: Hmm. I wonder if we could do something similar? Suzune: You mean like selling fortune cookies? That could work. Suzune: I've always thought it was a little unhygienic to put the fortune IN the cookie, though. Maybe we could have our customers draw their fortunes from a box, instead. Natsume: Oh, good idea. Would it be alright if we talked this over some more later tonight? Suzune: Sure. Kanna: I'm glad to see you so enthusiastic about work, but remember to take breaks too. Natsume: I know. Sorry. Kanna: At this rate, we'll be standing around talking all night. Why don't we call it a day? Kanna: Happy holidays, everyone. Suzune: Do you wanna come to my place after this, Natsume-san? Natsume: Would that be alright? Suzune: Sure. Not like I'm gonna be doing anything else anyway. Natsume: Alright. Thanks. Suzune: You can walk back with us too, if you want, Nozomi-san. Kousei, you take Mei-san home. Nozomi: See you later, Kousei-kun, Mei-chan! Happy holidays! Mei: Happy holidays! Mei: Sorry. Feels like you've been having to walk me home all the time this past week or so. Kousei: It's no big deal. Your house isn't that far, and it's dangerous for you to be walking alone at night anyway. If anything, I should've been doing this from the start. Mei: Ehehe. Thank you. Mei: By the way, do you have any plans for New Year's, Senpai? Kousei: Probably just gonna chill in my apartment the whole day. Mei: No family gatherings or anything? Kousei: Nah. I'd go see my dad, but I doubt he's coming back for New Year's. Kousei: What about you? Mei: I'm going to my grandparents' house on the 31st, and I'll probably stay there for a couple days. Mei: My relatives always get together to eat the soba noodles that my grandpa makes. Kousei: Oh, that sounds nice. Mei: If you're celebrating alone, I guess you're probably not gonna eat any osechi? Kousei: Nozomi usually brings me some, or invites me to eat with her family. Mei: Oh. You guys are pretty close, huh? Kousei: Yeah, though I always feel like I'm imposing, since the New Year is usually a really busy time for them. Kousei: So this year, I was just planning to laze around at home by myself. Mei: I'll have to message you a lot on Lime so that you don't get TOO bored. Kousei: I thought you were going to be celebrating with your relatives? Don't waste your time messaging me. Mei: I'll have plenty of time. It's a lot more fun talking to you than with my relatives, after all. Kousei: O-Oh, well if you say so. Kousei: Not if I message you first. Mei: Ahaha! We'll see about that. Mei: Anyway, thanks for walking me home, Senpai. Kousei: Don't mention it. I'll see you next year. Mei: Yep! Happy holidays! Kousei: Happy holidays. Kousei: What? Mei: To be honest, I was already halfway here when I realized I forgot to text you... Kousei: Oh, okay. Well, come on in. Mei: Excuse me! Kousei: Sorry about the mess. I didn't have time to clean up. Mei: No worries. It's my fault for dropping by on such short notice. Kousei: Make yourself at home. I'll get you something to drink. Mei: Actually, I already bought us drinks from the convenience store. Kousei: Oh, thanks. Appreciate it. Mei: Phew! It sure was cold out there. Kousei: Happy New Year. Mei: Here's to another great year! Kousei: Yep. Mei: It's nothing much, but please accept some of my grandma's homemade osechi as a gift. Kousei: Oh, thanks. Do you mind if I eat some right now? Mei: Go right ahead! I brought you some disposable chopsticks too. Kousei: Thanks. Mei: And for drinks, I've got green tea and red tea. Which one would you like? Kousei: I'll have the green tea. Mei: Sure. Here you go. Kousei: Thanks. You're always so thoughtful, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Ahaha! You're about to take that compliment back. Kousei: What do you mean? Mei: You'll see. Now go on and eat. Kousei: O-Okay. Kousei: There's only kelp rolls in here! Mei: Ahaha... I know. Those are actually my favorites. Mei: My grandma makes a ton of them every year because she knows I like them. Mei: But this time, I just couldn't finish them all... Mei: So I decided I'd share them with you instead! Mei: Sorry. I know osechi are supposed to have a lot more variety. Kousei: Oh, that's fine. It's the thought that counts. Mind if I go ahead and eat? Mei: Be my guest! In fact, I'll join you! Ah--you might find the stuffing a little odd, though. Kousei: Odd in what sense? Mei: Normally they're supposed to be stuffed with fish, but my grandma likes to use meat instead. Mei: Not to mention carrots, burdock roots, and other veggies. Kousei: That doesn't sound too bad. Let's see. Mei: I'm glad you like them! Did I mention they're my favorites too? Down the hatch! Mei: Mhhh! Shoo good! Kousei: Your grandma must be an amazing cook, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Yep! There's nothing like mom's cooking. Or grandma's, in this case. Mei: But maybe it's because they look so plain. My other relatives never touch these kelp rolls. Mei: I always end up being the only one who eats a lot. Kousei: That's probably why she made you so much. Mei: If only I had a bigger stomach, I'd be able to eat them all... Sorry, Grandma. Mei: Oh, but don't force yourself to eat them all either, Senpai. If you can't finish them, I'll just bring them home. Kousei: Actually, I'm starving. I can probably finish off the rest myself. Mei: Were you about to make lunch? I saw a bunch of ingredients laid out in the kitchen. Kousei: Hm? Oh, nah. I was trying to think up some new dishes for our menu. Mei: Wow. Eager beaver, huh? Kousei: Hmm... Not exactly. It's more like... Kousei: ...... Kousei: Remember what I told you on Christmas about my soul? Mei: Yeah. You said you had a problem with it. Kousei: Right. Apparently, I'm unsatisfied with my current life. Kousei: Honestly, I can't say I've consciously thought that myself... but because my soul isn't satisfied, it's been attracting butterflies. Mei: Hmm... Kousei: Thanks to Akizuki-san's intervention, my soul is okay for the time being. Kousei: But also, my soul apparently absorbs these butterflies as well. So even if I were attracting them, you probably wouldn't see them. Mei: Huh. Interesting. Kousei: So, in short, that tendency of my soul to absorb butterflies is the problem. Mei: Oh, okay. Because then the Grim Reapers can't collect them, just like the ones in my eye. Kousei: Yeah... Pretty much. "

            "Kousei: Hey, Nozomi... Can we go to your place? Nozomi: What? No, we can't... You and I aren't kids anymore. I mean, it'd be awkward... and embarrassing... Kousei: Then can you at least do me a favor and delete those recordings? Nozomi: What? I could never do that. They're precious memories to me. Kousei: You used to be such a sweet, obedient little girl. Kousei: When did you become such a rebellious young girl? You're gonna make Onii-chan cry! Nozomi: If my personality's gone rotten, I think we both know you're to blame. Kousei: Err... I can't exactly deny that. Nozomi: Maybe you should at least try to. Kousei: Well, I know your mom and dad are both good, nice people, so it couldn't be their fault. Nozomi: Nice to you, maybe... All they ever do to me is nag, nag, nag. Kousei: Speaking of that, umm--about those recordings. Nozomi: Yeah, I know. I was just kidding. If the idea of me holding onto those bothers you so much, I'll delete them. And I'll try not to sing those songs anymore, either. Kousei: Seriously? Nozomi: I'm gonna miss those little pieces of our childhood... but I'll be fine! I've already memorized the lyrics anyway. Kousei: Are you kidding me?! Nozomi: Aww, I'm just kidding! Your songs were way too wacky for me to memorize. Kousei: I'm not exactly sure how to feel about that. Nozomi: You're hard to please. Nozomi: Anyway, I'll delete them. Kousei: Thanks. Nozomi: Now, let's hurry up and eat. I'm starving. Kousei: Thanks for the food. Nozomi: Dig in. Nozomi: How's it taste? Kousei: Great. No complaints. Nozomi: Glad you like it. Kousei: I feel kinda bad about making you fix breakfast for me all the time, though... Nozomi: I don't mind. Nozomi: Mom and Dad prefer toast for breakfast, but I like rice, so that creates a bit of a problem. Kousei: Oh, right. Nozomi: Do you ever feel like having toast instead, Kousei-kun? I'm not forcing my preferences on you... am I? Kousei: I would've told you to stop coming if that were the case. Kousei: You make great food, so I've got zero complaints. It's much appreciated. Thank you very much. Nozomi: Heh. Keep showering me in praise! Kousei: These rolled omelets are especially good. Nozomi: I meant me, not the food... Nozomi: Well, whatever. I guess I should know better than to expect a guy like you to be able to compliment a girl. Kousei: Excuse you? I'm the most honest, open guy you'll ever find. Remember back when we were kids? I'd always-- Nozomi: Mhh! These salmon fillets are perfect! I nailed the seasoning today! Kousei: Will you listen to me? Nozomi: Oh, right! I almost forgot; Dad wanted me to tell you something. Kousei: Your dad did? Kousei: Wait, don't tell me... Nozomi: Judging from the look on your face, I think you've already figured it out. Kousei: It's about my rent, isn't it? Nozomi: Bingo. Since you chose the correct answer, you get a prize! Your prize is: paying rent! Kousei: Just out of curiosity, how many months has it been? Nozomi: As of today: four months. Kousei: My old man's done it again... Nozomi: Mr. Kazufumi hasn't been in tocuh with you either, Kousei-kun? Kousei: Nope. We don't talk very often in the first place. I haven't the foggiest idea where he is right now or what he's up to... Nozomi: When's that gonna be, though? You still haven't found a new job, have you? Kousei: Err, well, about that, actually. Nozomi: I know. You don't have to say it. Kousei: Wait, I can explain! I really am looking for one! And I didn't quit my job at the convenience store 'cause I wanted to, okay? If my manager wasn't such an asshole... Kousei: I told him a month in advance I'd need time off to study for exams, but what did he do? Schedule me shift after shift, tell me I need to find someone to cover my shifts if I want time off. And he has the gall to lecture ME about responsibility? Nozomi: This is the same guy that accused you of stealing money from the cash register and took it out of your paycheck, right? Nozomi: You've already told me plenty about how crappy it was there. Kousei: Right. Nozomi: And you've been looking for a new job ever since, but haven't been able to find one. Kousei: Yeah... Nozomi: You're a worthless bum, aint'cha? Kousei: I know... And don't forget to add \"waste-of-space\" and \"good-for-nothing\" to the list too. Nozomi: Seriously, though. What're you gonna do? Nozomi: What? Kousei: Wanna get married? Nozomi: Kousei-kun... I don't know how to respond to that. Marriage is a big deal, you know? Why are you bringing this up so randomly... Kousei: I want to drink your miso soup every morning... Nozomi: You basically already do. Kousei: But I wanna be a lazy bastard who does nothing all day long. I want to marry into money so you can support my lifestyle... Pretty please? Nozomi: You're being way too bold with this proposal... My heart's gonna skip a beat... Kousei: I'll work hard. I'll be the best gigolo the world's ever seen, I promise... So will you take me, Nozomi? Nozomi: Oh, gosh... No one's ever confessed to me before... And to be a gigolo, of all things... Nozomi: Well, I'll ask Mom what she thinks about it first. Kousei: Wait, hold up. Don't do that, please? I don't want her getting the wrong idea. Nozomi: All joking aside--you're not actually planning on becoming a gigolo, are you? That's kind of gross, you know... Kousei: No, I'm not. I'll work to support myself. Nozomi: Well, good. Kousei: I promise I'll pay the rent; I just need some time. Again, I'm really sorry about this. Nozomi: Relax, I was just playing along with the joke. I don't think Dad's that worried about the rent. He knows your dad will pay once he gets ahold of him. Nozomi: What I'm worried about is your lifestyle, though. Are you able to eat enough without any income? Kousei: Yeah, I am. Nozomi: He says you're welcome to stay over anytime. Kousei: Thanks... I'll take him up on that if I run out of options. Nozomi: Still, I think he'd feel a lot better if you dropped by and said hello. Kousei: I will. I'll come by soon and explain things to him. Nozomi: Good. Kousei: Alright. Thanks for breakfast. Nozomi: You're welcome. Nozomi: Don't hesitate to come talk to me if you're having money problems. I know you probably don't feel comfortable asking Dad for help, but I'm always willing to. I have a bit of money saved up myself. Kousei: I can't ask you to lend me money. That's just plain shameless. Nozomi: Oh, really? Didn't you just ask me to marry you so you didn't have to work? Kousei: Come on, you know I was just joking. Kousei: I appreciate the sentiment, but I'm not gonna take your money. Kousei: You already help me out more than enough by cooking me breakfast every day. So thanks for that. Nozomi: Mhm. Kousei: Actually, shouldn't you probably head out soon? Nozomi: Oh, gosh! I didn't know it was this late already. Kousei: I'll take care of the clean up. Nozomi: Really? Thanks. Kousei: No problem. It's the least I can do. Kousei: You already did the work of cooking this. Plus, this is my apartment. Nozomi: Alright. I'm gonna get going then. Nozomi: You need to hear that more than me. Make sure you leave on time, okay? Nozomi: See you later! Kousei: Have fun at school. And watch out for cars. Kousei: Guess I better start getting ready for class. Hiroto: Oh, look who it is! You coming to campus too, Kousei? Kousei: Oh. Hey, Hiroto. Hiroto: Guess you didn't check your email. Professor Komatsu can't come in today, so class is cancelled. Kousei: Seriously? Damn, I rushed on over here for nothing. Hiroto: Maybe. Seems like they wrote it in a hurry this morning. But either way, that means we've got some free time on our hands. Kousei: Yeah. Guess we better find some place to kill some time at. Hiroto: Why don't we chill in the cafeteria for a bit? Kousei: Sounds fine to me. Hiroto: Wanna grab a bite to eat while we're at it? Kousei: They're not open this early, are they? Hiroto: We got that convenience store next door, though. Kousei: Nah, I'm good. I had breakfast before I came. Hiroto: Alright. Guess I'll get myself a coffee then... You want one too? Kousei: If you're paying. Hiroto: Sure, why not? I'm in a good mood today. Kousei: Oh, sweet. I guess I'll take one. Hiroto: Gotcha. Milk and sugar? Kousei: Nope. Make it black. Hiroto: Are you for real, man?! Kousei: *sip*... Phew... Hiroto: ...... Kousei: What? Hiroto: Is that not, like, really bitter? Kousei: Well, of course it is. It's coffee. Hiroto: That doesn't mean you gotta drink it without any sugar or anything. You trying to act sophisticated or something? Kousei: Nah, I just don't really like sugar in my coffee. Makes the acidity more pronounced. Hiroto: Does it? Can't say I've ever noticed. Hiroto: Mind if I take a sip? Kousei: Go ahead. You paid for it. Kousei: What are you doing? Hiroto: Thanks, man. Kousei: No problem. Hiroto: Here's your coffee back. I don't know how the hell you can drink this bitter crap. Kousei: I just don't like really acidic coffee, personally. Hiroto: Different strokes for different folks, I guess. Hiroto: But man, I wasted all my coffee. Maybe I used up all my luck yesterday. Kousei: Come to think of it, you did say you're in a good mood. Kousei: Did you win big at mahjong or something? Hiroto: Hell yeah. In the final round, I managed to turn the game around with a riichi, ippatsu, pinfu, junchan, sanshoku, iipeikou, and triple dora! And you bet your ass I declared riichi there! Kousei: Dang. Hiroto: Interested in mahjong, Kousei? You should play with me sometime. It's fun. Kousei: Sure, when I have the time to. Right now, my top priority is finding a job. Hiroto: Your last job was at that convenience store, right? I remember you telling me about how you quit 'cause of your douchebag manager. Kousei: Do you know any good-paying places that are hiring? And brainless work, preferably. Hiroto: Yeah, right. I'd be working there myself, if I did. Kousei: True. Guess I gotta find one myself the old-fashioned way. Hiroto: Finding something part-time's important, but don't forget we gotta start doing real job hunting next year. Kousei: Yeah... Hiroto: What's your plan? Any particular field you wanna work in? Kousei: No clue. The whole idea of a \"real-world\" job still feels kinda foreign to me. Hiroto: I know what ya mean. I dunno what I wanna do either... Kousei: Well, not like you're gonna get any useful advice out of me. Don't you know someone who's a working adult? Ask them. Hiroto: Huh? Who are you--wait... you aren't talking about my sister, are you? Kousei: What're you grimacing at me for? I thought you were on relatively good terms. Hiroto: I mean, sure, I don't hate her or anything. Hiroto: But she's always bossed me around, stealing my drinks and snacks for about as long as I can remember... Pretty much the last person I'd go to for real help. Kousei: Even though you're siblings? Hiroto: Because we're siblings. I know for a fact she'd just laugh and tease me for it. Hiroto: And it's not like she'd be much help even if she did decide to take me seriously. She's always known what she wanted to do when she grew up. Kousei: She's a pastry chef, isn't she? Hiroto: If she hasn't changed jobs, then yeah. Hiroto: You're probably more up-to-date with her life than me, though, to be honest. Kousei: What? Why would I be? Hiroto: You live in the same apartment complex as her. Heck, I've barely even seen her since she moved out. Kousei: Really? Hiroto: She does come home to visit for New Year's, but that's pretty much it. Hiroto: That time you and I went to say hi, I hadn't seen her in half a year. Kousei: Well, I haven't heard anything about a tenant being found dead, so I guess... Just because we live in the same complex doesn't mean I actually see her. Kousei: Are you concerned about her or something? Hiroto: Not particularly myself... But our mom's a bit worried. Hiroto: Apparently she's been sounding kinda tense over the phone, lately, so she thinks she might be stressed out or something. Kousei: Is that not reason enough for you to check up on her then? Hiroto: Maybe, but I really don't wanna see her. She'll just boss me around like always. Kousei: She seemed like a nice person to me, though. Hiroto: That's just what she wants you to think, man. She's a real tyrant around people she knows. Brash and brazen as hell.  Kousei: Damn, you're savage. Hiroto: Most siblings are that way when they're close in age. Kousei: Well, I'm an only child, so honestly, I'm a little jealous. Hiroto: You shouldn't be. I'd gladly switch places with you. Being bossed around your whole life sucks, I tell you. Hiroto: But anyway, if you see her, do me a favor and let her know our mom's worried about her. Kousei: Sure, I'll try. I think our schedules are pretty different, though, so no guarantees. Hiroto: All good. It's probably nothing serious, honestly. Hiroto: If it were, my mom would've gone over there herself. Kousei: Yeah. Kousei: Well, I hope she's doing alright. Being a working adult must be pretty stressful... Kousei: Speaking of which, weren't you doing an internship somewhere? Hiroto: Yeah, for a bit. What about you? Kousei: I did something similar. Didn't really feel like the right fit for me, though. Hiroto: I know what you mean. Internships are kinda pointless if you don't have a clear idea of what sort of work you wanna do. Kousei: Yeah. Hiroto: *sigh*... If only I could stay in school forever and not have to worry about getting a job. Kousei: Have you thought about going to graduate school? Hiroto: That's not what I'm talking about, man. Kousei: Personally, I just wanna have a nice, normal life... Get a job, make a living, find a girlfriend, get married, have kids, and build a happy family. Hiroto: Yeah, but honestly, even something as \"normal\" as that feels impossible to achieve nowadays. Kousei: I know what you mean... Hiroto: Who's to say we'll even be able to find a decent job? Kousei: Yeah... Hiroto: And forget marriage--I'm not even confident I'll able to get myself a girlfriend... Kousei: That might be more of a challenge than finding a job, honestly. Hiroto: You can say that again. Hiroto: At the very least, I just hope I can lose my virginity before I graduate. Kousei: I remember when I thought I'd lose my virginity before I hit twenty. Those were the days. Hiroto: Same. Hiroto: It just keeps getting further and further away, man. Kousei: I know what you mean. Hiroto: Well, worst case scenario--I can always go into porn. Kousei: Well, damn. Good luck with that. Hiroto: Yeah, thanks. Kousei: C'mon, let's get off this topic. You're killing my mood. Hiroto: Sure thing. Here's to... Actually, nevermind. I don't have any coffee left. Kousei: Yeah, you spilled the whole damn thing. Hiroto: Well, shit... I kinda want some, but not enough to buy another cup. Kousei: I could buy you one. Hiroto: You sure? Kousei: You paid for mine, so it's the least I can do. No biggie. Hiroto: Alright then. Ah--and don't forget to put a bunch of sugar in it, okay? Kousei: Yeah, I will. Hiroto: Oh, and make sure you put the sugar in the cup first before pouring in the coffee. Kousei: Geez. Anything else, Your Highness? Hiroto: Trust me, it tastes better that way. Plus it saves you the work of having to stir it. Kousei: Yeah, okay. Kousei: One small coffee, please. Store Clerk: That'll be 100 yen. Kousei: Here. Store Clerk: Thank you, and have a good day. Kousei: You too. Girl: A small coffee, please. Store Clerk: That'll be 100 yen. Thank you, and have a good day. Girl: Hm? Kousei: Um, you can go ahead. I have to put some sugar in mine first. Girl: Oh, okay. Excuse me. Natsume: Ah! Natsume: I want to ask you something. Natsume: Is it normal for the coffee here to taste super bitter? Kousei: Yeah, I think so. Natsume: Are you sure the machine isn't just broken? It took a while for the liquid to start coming out... Kousei: No, that's normal too. The machine didn't sound like it was acting up, either. Natsume: Oh... Natsume: Well, thanks for the help. Kousei: You're welcome. "

            "Kousei: ...... Kousei: Don't call them just for laughs. I'm sure they're busy. Kousei: Look, I'm not having weird thoughts or anything. I'm just nervous, that's all. Kousei: There's just something strange about seeing you in my room. Natsume: Well, I guess I don't blame you. I'm a little nervous too. Kousei: You are? Natsume: I keep telling myself there's nothing to be anxious about, but this is the first time I've ever been to a guy's apartment too. Natsume: O-Oh! A kotatsu. Nothing beats a kotatsu in the winter, huh? But I have to say, your place is a lot cleaner than I thought it'd be. Kousei: Well, you know. Natsume: I bet Sumizome-san's the one who does most of the cleaning, though. Am I right? Kousei: She used to, but these days, I do it all myself. Kousei: Since she always used to keep everything clean for me, I can't stand leaving things messy now. Kousei: And letting junk pile up just means more work when you have to clean it up later. If I have to spend my days off doing housework, it ends up feeling like I've wasted the day away. Natsume: No wonder you didn't seem fazed when I suddenly asked if I could come over. Natsume: By the way, where do you keep your spices and seasonings? You don't mind if I poke around, do you? Kousei: Most of the stuff I have is in the fridge, or under the sink. Natsume: It's nothing special, so keep your expectations low. Kousei: I don't buy it. This has to be delicious. Kousei: Mhh! This is great! Your ginger-fried pork is something else! So delicious! Natsume: That's laying it on a bit thick. Kousei: No, seriously. I know you told me not to expect much, but this honestly tastes amazing. Natsume: Does it? Well, um, I'm glad you like it. Kousei: Ah, I know. It's a bit sweeter. Kousei: Did you use sugar when making the sauce? Natsume: Nrgh... Natsume: Yes, I did, but it's not because I'm bad with ginger, okay? It's not THAT bitter. Kousei: I know. I wasn't saying it's too sweet. Kousei: In fact, it's just right. You're pretty good at cooking. Natsume: I only cook well enough for myself. I don't know if I'd say I'm \"good\" at it. Kousei: Maybe, but it's far from bad. I'd say your taste for seasoning is pretty sharp. Kousei: Well, except for that time you basically drank a cup of coffee-flavored sugar. Natsume: Tch. Shuddup, will you? Coffee's not the same. You all are the weird ones for being able to drink something that bitter. Kousei: Maybe, but I don't think that much sugar is good for you. Not that you drink it every day, but still. Natsume: Well, thanks for your concern. Kousei: But anyway, this is delicious. Makes me want to try your curry or your Hamburg steak too. Natsume: Now who's got childish tastes? Kousei: I don't wanna hear that from someone who can't eat green peppers. Natsume: Nrghhh... Kousei: I really do want to try your other stuff, though. Natsume: Well, maybe some other time. Natsume: Well, in that case, takoyaki and yakisoba are the simplest things that come to mind. Kousei: Baby castella cakes are pretty easy to make too. Natsume: Simple enough for an amateur to make? Kousei: I mean, probably. With a bit of practice, at least. Natsume: Oh! I almost forgot about the most important thing. Natsume: We also need to think about what our customers would want, and who we're trying to target. People of all ages and genders come to visit the shrine on New Year's, after all. Kousei: That's why stuff like takoyaki is so popular. It's hard to resist the urge when you see them. They're a street stall staple. Natsume: Hmm... But there's no reason we can't compete by selling other staples, is there? Natsume: Festival staples, New Year's staples, winter staples... Kousei: You mean like osechi, or mochi? Natsume: Speaking of winter... For me, it's got to be the kotatsu. Natsume: *sigh*... So warm and toasty. Kousei: Want some tangerines? Natsume: Oh, sure. Kousei: Here. Natsume: Thanks. Nothing says Japanese winter like a kotatsu and tangerines. Kousei: Now that you mention it, we should probably sell something that'll warm people up. Natsume: Something warm... Like hot pot? Or oden, or maybe miso soup, or pork soup. Kousei: It needs to be something people can eat while walking, though. Kousei: Hmm. What about roasted sweet potatoes? Natsume: Maybe Suzune-san could use them to make some kind of cake, like for a January special? No, but then we might not have enough potatoes... Kousei: Plus the variety of potato we use for roasting might not be the best for making sweets, either. Kousei: Hmm. I always see it in the hot foods section at the convenience store, yeah. Kousei: But speaking of convenience store food--what about Chinese meat buns? "

            "Natsume: Yeah. I'm not the kind of person who drinks at home, for example. Natsume: But it's my own fault for drinking too much today, so no need to make excuses for me. Kousei: No, that's not what I meant. Kousei: I'm just surprised you know about such fancy bars despite being someone who doesn't drink often. Natsume: I wouldn't say I love hanging out at fancy bars, but I've always wanted to try going to one at least once, you know? Kousei: Yeah. Makes you feel cooler. Kousei: So what, are you hooked now that you've tried it? Natsume: I wouldn't go that far. But the atmosphere there is quite relaxing, and their cocktails are really good too. Kousei: Have you ever had anyone hit on you there? Natsume: Honestly, I thought I'd have to deal with that when I first went, but lo and behold, I've never experienced anything like that. Kousei: You never got a free drink from the \"gentleman over there\" or anything? Natsume: I was kind of hoping I would, at least once, but nobody does stuff like that anymore, I guess. Kousei: No? I always thought bars were places for people to hook up. Natsume: Probably depends on the bar. But the place we went to doesn't get those sort of rowdy customers. Kousei: Yeah. Kousei: I'm not going too fast for you, am I? Natsume: Nope, this is just fine. Thanks. Natsume: Hm? Hmm... Why not ask out someone you're actually interested in next time? Kousei: Well, I would, but I don't have anyone I'm particularly interested in at the moment. Kousei: Besides, it'd probably be kinda off-putting if I randomly asked a girl to go to a bar with me, just the two of us. Natsume: True. Most girls would assume you had some ulterior motive. Kousei: Exactly. Which is why it's too difficult. For someone like me, anyway. Natsume: There you go again. Natsume: Well, as long as it's just for drinks, I guess I don't mind. Ah, take a left up here. Kousei: Yes, ma'am. Natsume: I can make it home from here. Thanks. Natsume: Goodnight. Kousei: Yeah. Night. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Was she doing it on purpose? Was this some kind of test? Kousei: Hmm. That's rare. Nozomi: Well, more so my dad than me. Kousei: Mind if I call you? Nozomi: Sure. That's fine. Kousei: Hey. Sorry for calling so late. Nozomi: Nah, it's fine. Kousei: So, what does your dad want? Nozomi: He said he has a bit of a favor he wants to ask you for New Year's, but I don't know what it is specifically. Nozomi: Want me to just put him on the phone? Kousei: Hmm... Kousei: I get the feeling it'll take a while, so why don't I head over to your house instead? Your dad's home, isn't he? Nozomi: Yeah, he is. You can come on over. Kousei: Great. I'll be there soon. Nozomi: Okay. See you in a bit. Kousei: I wonder what this is all about? "

            "Kousei: ...... Kousei: Don't call them just for laughs. I'm sure they're busy. Kousei: Look, I'm not having weird thoughts or anything. I'm just nervous, that's all. Kousei: There's just something strange about seeing you in my room. Natsume: Well, I guess I don't blame you. I'm a little nervous too. Kousei: You are? Natsume: I keep telling myself there's nothing to be anxious about, but this is the first time I've ever been to a guy's apartment too. Natsume: O-Oh! A kotatsu. Nothing beats a kotatsu in the winter, huh? But I have to say, your place is a lot cleaner than I thought it'd be. Kousei: Well, you know. Natsume: I bet Sumizome-san's the one who does most of the cleaning, though. Am I right? Kousei: She used to, but these days, I do it all myself. Kousei: Since she always used to keep everything clean for me, I can't stand leaving things messy now. Kousei: And letting junk pile up just means more work when you have to clean it up later. If I have to spend my days off doing housework, it ends up feeling like I've wasted the day away. Natsume: No wonder you didn't seem fazed when I suddenly asked if I could come over. Natsume: By the way, where do you keep your spices and seasonings? You don't mind if I poke around, do you? Kousei: Most of the stuff I have is in the fridge, or under the sink. Natsume: It's nothing special, so keep your expectations low. Kousei: I don't buy it. This has to be delicious. Kousei: Mhh! This is great! Your ginger-fried pork is something else! So delicious! Natsume: That's laying it on a bit thick. Kousei: No, seriously. I know you told me not to expect much, but this honestly tastes amazing. Natsume: Does it? Well, um, I'm glad you like it. Kousei: Ah, I know. It's a bit sweeter. Kousei: Did you use sugar when making the sauce? Natsume: Nrgh... Natsume: Yes, I did, but it's not because I'm bad with ginger, okay? It's not THAT bitter. Kousei: I know. I wasn't saying it's too sweet. Kousei: In fact, it's just right. You're pretty good at cooking. Natsume: I only cook well enough for myself. I don't know if I'd say I'm \"good\" at it. Kousei: Maybe, but it's far from bad. I'd say your taste for seasoning is pretty sharp. Kousei: Well, except for that time you basically drank a cup of coffee-flavored sugar. Natsume: Tch. Shuddup, will you? Coffee's not the same. You all are the weird ones for being able to drink something that bitter. Kousei: Maybe, but I don't think that much sugar is good for you. Not that you drink it every day, but still. Natsume: Well, thanks for your concern. Kousei: But anyway, this is delicious. Makes me want to try your curry or your Hamburg steak too. Natsume: Now who's got childish tastes? Kousei: I don't wanna hear that from someone who can't eat green peppers. Natsume: Nrghhh... Kousei: I really do want to try your other stuff, though. Natsume: Well, maybe some other time. Natsume: Well, in that case, takoyaki and yakisoba are the simplest things that come to mind. Kousei: Baby castella cakes are pretty easy to make too. Natsume: Simple enough for an amateur to make? Kousei: I mean, probably. With a bit of practice, at least. Natsume: Oh! I almost forgot about the most important thing. Natsume: We also need to think about what our customers would want, and who we're trying to target. People of all ages and genders come to visit the shrine on New Year's, after all. Kousei: That's why stuff like takoyaki is so popular. It's hard to resist the urge when you see them. They're a street stall staple. Natsume: Hmm... But there's no reason we can't compete by selling other staples, is there? Natsume: Festival staples, New Year's staples, winter staples... Kousei: You mean like osechi, or mochi? Natsume: Speaking of winter... For me, it's got to be the kotatsu. Natsume: *sigh*... So warm and toasty. Kousei: Want some tangerines? Natsume: Oh, sure. Kousei: Here. Natsume: Thanks. Nothing says Japanese winter like a kotatsu and tangerines. Kousei: Now that you mention it, we should probably sell something that'll warm people up. Natsume: Something warm... Like hot pot? Or oden, or maybe miso soup, or pork soup. Kousei: It needs to be something people can eat while walking, though. Kousei: Hmm. What about roasted sweet potatoes? Natsume: Maybe Suzune-san could use them to make some kind of cake, like for a January special? No, but then we might not have enough potatoes... Kousei: Plus the variety of potato we use for roasting might not be the best for making sweets, either. Kousei: Hmm. I always see it in the hot foods section at the convenience store, yeah. Kousei: But speaking of convenience store food--what about Chinese meat buns? "

            "Mikado: I am pleased to report that our sales have been steadily increasing. Especially over the Christmas holidays. Kanna: Our sales were record-high! Natsume: I never realized how important seasonal events were. Seeing how successful our Christmas campaign was made me think about doing something for New Year's too, but-- Mei: Oh? What did you have in mind? Natsume: On second thought, we'd get a reputation as a scummy workplace if we made our employees work on Christmas AND New Year's. Kousei: Well, scummy rhymes with yummy. Natsume: Excuse you? Kousei: Nothing. Just forget I said anything. Natsume: What is it with you and making stupid jokes? Kousei: I'm sorry. Just ignore me. Kanna: He definitely has a strange habit of making unfunny jokes. I'm reminded of the whole \"dude\" incident. Kousei: Wh-Why do you still remember that? Nozomi: What's this \"dude\" incident you're talking about? Natsume: This one time, he thought it'd be cool to end all of his sentences with \"dude.\" Kousei: Agh! Stop! Please! I'm sorry! Suzune: Tell me about this later. I want all those juicy details. Natsume: Sure. Kousei: Oh, come on! Natsume: Anyway, enough about Takamine-kun. Sumizome-san? Nozomi: Yes? Natsume: Your family runs the nearby shrine, don't they? Nozomi: Yeah, they do. Natsume: Just out of curiosity, does your shrine do any sort of special event for New Year's? Nozomi: Hmm. Well, we do serve holy rice wine and host a special dance performance. Also, let me think... Mei: Do you do fortune telling? Nozomi: Oh, we do that all year round. But I guess we do get a lot more people doing it during the new year. Natsume: Hmm. I wonder if we could do something similar? Suzune: You mean like selling fortune cookies? That could work. Suzune: I've always thought it was a little unhygienic to put the fortune IN the cookie, though. Maybe we could have our customers draw their fortunes from a box, instead. Natsume: Oh, good idea. Would it be alright if we talked this over some more later tonight? Suzune: Sure. Kanna: I'm glad to see you so enthusiastic about work, but remember to take breaks too. Natsume: I know. Sorry. Kanna: At this rate, we'll be standing around talking all night. Why don't we call it a day? Kanna: Happy holidays, everyone. Suzune: Do you wanna come to my place after this, Natsume-san? Natsume: Would that be alright? Suzune: Sure. Not like I'm gonna be doing anything else anyway. Natsume: Alright. Thanks. Suzune: You can walk back with us too, if you want, Nozomi-san. Kousei, you take Mei-san home. Nozomi: See you later, Kousei-kun, Mei-chan! Happy holidays! Mei: Happy holidays! Mei: Sorry. Feels like you've been having to walk me home all the time this past week or so. Kousei: It's no big deal. Your house isn't that far, and it's dangerous for you to be walking alone at night anyway. If anything, I should've been doing this from the start. Mei: Ehehe. Thank you. Mei: By the way, do you have any plans for New Year's, Senpai? Kousei: Probably just gonna chill in my apartment the whole day. Mei: No family gatherings or anything? Kousei: Nah. I'd go see my dad, but I doubt he's coming back for New Year's. Kousei: What about you? Mei: I'm going to my grandparents' house on the 31st, and I'll probably stay there for a couple days. Mei: My relatives always get together to eat the soba noodles that my grandpa makes. Kousei: Oh, that sounds nice. Mei: If you're celebrating alone, I guess you're probably not gonna eat any osechi? Kousei: Nozomi usually brings me some, or invites me to eat with her family. Mei: Oh. You guys are pretty close, huh? Kousei: Yeah, though I always feel like I'm imposing, since the New Year is usually a really busy time for them. Kousei: So this year, I was just planning to laze around at home by myself. Mei: I'll have to message you a lot on Lime so that you don't get TOO bored. Kousei: I thought you were going to be celebrating with your relatives? Don't waste your time messaging me. Mei: I'll have plenty of time. It's a lot more fun talking to you than with my relatives, after all. Kousei: O-Oh, well if you say so. Kousei: Not if I message you first. Mei: Ahaha! We'll see about that. Mei: Anyway, thanks for walking me home, Senpai. Kousei: Don't mention it. I'll see you next year. Mei: Yep! Happy holidays! Kousei: Happy holidays. Kousei: What? Mei: To be honest, I was already halfway here when I realized I forgot to text you... Kousei: Oh, okay. Well, come on in. Mei: Excuse me! Kousei: Sorry about the mess. I didn't have time to clean up. Mei: No worries. It's my fault for dropping by on such short notice. Kousei: Make yourself at home. I'll get you something to drink. Mei: Actually, I already bought us drinks from the convenience store. Kousei: Oh, thanks. Appreciate it. Mei: Phew! It sure was cold out there. Kousei: Happy New Year. Mei: Here's to another great year! Kousei: Yep. Mei: It's nothing much, but please accept some of my grandma's homemade osechi as a gift. Kousei: Oh, thanks. Do you mind if I eat some right now? Mei: Go right ahead! I brought you some disposable chopsticks too. Kousei: Thanks. Mei: And for drinks, I've got green tea and red tea. Which one would you like? Kousei: I'll have the green tea. Mei: Sure. Here you go. Kousei: Thanks. You're always so thoughtful, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Ahaha! You're about to take that compliment back. Kousei: What do you mean? Mei: You'll see. Now go on and eat. Kousei: O-Okay. Kousei: There's only kelp rolls in here! Mei: Ahaha... I know. Those are actually my favorites. Mei: My grandma makes a ton of them every year because she knows I like them. Mei: But this time, I just couldn't finish them all... Mei: So I decided I'd share them with you instead! Mei: Sorry. I know osechi are supposed to have a lot more variety. Kousei: Oh, that's fine. It's the thought that counts. Mind if I go ahead and eat? Mei: Be my guest! In fact, I'll join you! Ah--you might find the stuffing a little odd, though. Kousei: Odd in what sense? Mei: Normally they're supposed to be stuffed with fish, but my grandma likes to use meat instead. Mei: Not to mention carrots, burdock roots, and other veggies. Kousei: That doesn't sound too bad. Let's see. Mei: I'm glad you like them! Did I mention they're my favorites too? Down the hatch! Mei: Mhhh! Shoo good! Kousei: Your grandma must be an amazing cook, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Yep! There's nothing like mom's cooking. Or grandma's, in this case. Mei: But maybe it's because they look so plain. My other relatives never touch these kelp rolls. Mei: I always end up being the only one who eats a lot. Kousei: That's probably why she made you so much. Mei: If only I had a bigger stomach, I'd be able to eat them all... Sorry, Grandma. Mei: Oh, but don't force yourself to eat them all either, Senpai. If you can't finish them, I'll just bring them home. Kousei: Actually, I'm starving. I can probably finish off the rest myself. Mei: Were you about to make lunch? I saw a bunch of ingredients laid out in the kitchen. Kousei: Hm? Oh, nah. I was trying to think up some new dishes for our menu. Mei: Wow. Eager beaver, huh? Kousei: Hmm... Not exactly. It's more like... Kousei: ...... Kousei: Remember what I told you on Christmas about my soul? Mei: Yeah. You said you had a problem with it. Kousei: Right. Apparently, I'm unsatisfied with my current life. Kousei: Honestly, I can't say I've consciously thought that myself... but because my soul isn't satisfied, it's been attracting butterflies. Mei: Hmm... Kousei: Thanks to Akizuki-san's intervention, my soul is okay for the time being. Kousei: But also, my soul apparently absorbs these butterflies as well. So even if I were attracting them, you probably wouldn't see them. Mei: Huh. Interesting. Kousei: So, in short, that tendency of my soul to absorb butterflies is the problem. Mei: Oh, okay. Because then the Grim Reapers can't collect them, just like the ones in my eye. Kousei: Yeah... Pretty much. "

Natsume: Stop countering me with facts and logic. Kousei: Then why make the argument if you know you're wrong? Natsume: Oh, come on. It's not like I'm asking you to wear something as embarrassing as that qipao. Kousei: Well, as long as it's similar to what Mikado usually wears, I guess it won't be too terribly embarrassing... Natsume: Oh, I know! I'll even pick out a necktie for you. Kousei: This isn't something we can just decide on the spur of the moment, though. Kousei: We'll have to discuss it with Akizuki-san and the others first. Natsume: Yeah, but you'll still be needing a new necktie. You know, since you'll be getting plenty of opportunities to wear a suit when you start job hunting. Kousei: Ugh... Don't remind me of that.

So this is pre-cum. Is it supposed to be this bitter? Kousei: I guess it probably depends on your overall health? I'm really not sure, though. Kousei: Can't say I've ever tasted my own pre-cum before. Natsume: Well, as long as it isn't poisonous... *lick* *slurp* Kousei: I know you don't like bitter things, Natsume. You don't have to force yourself to taste it. Natsume: What? I'm not forcing myself. It might be bitter, but it's nowhere near as bad as coffee. I can handle this.

            "Natsume: Hey. Mei: How's Kousei-senpai doing? Kanna: He seemed fine. He had a decent appetite, and his temperature was normal too. Suzune: Phew. That's good to hear. Kanna: Thank you for lending me your key, Nozomi-san. Nozomi: You're welcome. I was feeling pretty worried myself; Kousei-kun rarely gets so sick that he has to stay at home. Mei: Really? Nozomi: He always seems relatively healthy, doesn't he? Nozomi: As far back as I can remember, he's never come down with anything worse than a light cold. His immune system must be pretty strong. Suzune: Hmm. So I guess even people like him aren't invincible? Kanna: It is winter, after all. Perhaps he let his guard down a little too much. Kanna: But I'm sure he'll be fit as a fiddle by tomorrow. Mikado: Well then, now that our worries have been laid to rest, let us get back to cleaning up. Nozomi & Mei: Okaay. Mikado: So. Mikado: How was Takamine Kousei truly doing? Kanna: As we feared, his soul had weakened considerably. Mikado: I assume you treated him accordingly? Kanna: Yes, of course. In order to return his weakened soul to normal, I poured my energy into-- Kanna: I mean, that is to say... Kanna: ...... Kanna: I did what had to be done. Mikado: That is quite the vague way of putting it. Kanna: Pay me no mind. Mikado: ...... Mikado: Come to think of it, I believe that you have to physically touch someone in order to transfer your energy to them. Kanna: Yes... that you do. Mikado: And furthermore, it cannot be a simple holding of the hands. It has to be a more intimate method of contact, if I recall. Kanna: ...... Mikado: Did you have sexual intercourse with him, by chance? Kanna: Of course not! Where on earth did that come from?! Mikado: You were acting quite odd, so I thought perhaps that was why... Kanna: Excuse you? What, did you think that instead of pouring my energy into him, he poured his essence into ME?! Kanna: You're so vulgar, Mikado-san. Mikado: That is simply your own filthy mind clouding your judgment, you nymphomanic excuse of a Grim Reaper. Kanna: Please never call me that ever again. Mikado: Still, something happened, no? You have a terrible poker face when it comes to hiding your own secrets. Kanna: Nothing happened. I just... put my forehead against his. Mikado: Hmm. Nothing too strange, I suppose. Kanna: The idea seemed fine to me at first, since it's something a parent might do for their child... Kanna: But once I actually did it, I started feeling incredibly embarrassed for some reason... and my heart began pounding like crazy... Kanna: Then I started babbling nonsense, shouting sex this, sex that. Mikado: Now you have lost me. Kanna: (Maybe it's because I did something I've never experienced before. Something I wasn't used to...) Kanna: (Maybe that's why it makes my heart race just thinking back on it.) Kanna: (In fact... Ever since I met Takamine-san, I've been feeling my heart race quite often.) Kanna: (But it goes beyond just that.) Kanna: (We've also had lots of fun chatting about silly things, phone shopping, eating yakiniku with everyone, and taking lots of pictures.) Kanna: (Enjoyable memories that don't just make my heart race, but also bring a smile to my face.) Kanna: (When did I begin to actively want to do those things with others...) Kanna: (And whenever the thought crosses my mind--) Kanna: (I naturally picture Takamine-san there as well.) Mikado: ...... Kanna: Oh! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to get lost in thought. Mikado: In any case, is it safe to say that the matter with Takamine Kousei's weakened soul has been resolved? Kanna: Yes. I believe he should be up and about by tomorrow. Mikado: And what about you? Are you... Mikado: ...... Mikado: Never mind. Forget it. Mikado: At any rate, even assuming Takamine Kousei feels well enough to return to work tomorrow, I suggest you keep a close eye on him. Kanna: Tomorrow... Mikado: Is something the matter? Kanna: No, it's nothing. Kanna: (Is it... normal that I can't wait to see him back at work tomorrow?) Kousei: Hmm? Child: Forgive me... I'm sorry, I'm sorry... Kousei: What a weird dream, though. Kousei: Why are you whispering like you're filming a prank video? Nozomi: Huh? You're already awake, Kousei-kun? How are you feeling? Kousei: I feel fine. Great, even. Kousei: What are you doing here so early, though? Nozomi: I came to see how you were doing, duh. Kousei: I appreciate the concern, but I'm all better now. Couldn't be better, in fact. Nozomi: Are you planning to go to work today? Kousei: Yep. With the way I'm feeling, I shouldn't need to play it safe. Nozomi: Hmm... Let me see. Nozomi: I've got some breakfast prepared for you, so why don't we eat together? You are hungry, aren't you? Kousei: Absolutely. But if you're only gonna start cooking now, I might end up late for work. Nozomi: Worry not, Kousei-kun. It's just last night's leftovers. Nozomi: I was worried you might not have an appetite, so I packed everything into these Tupperware containers in case you needed to keep them in the fridge for a while. Kousei: Man, you're the perfect girl, Nozomi. Nozomi: Ehehe! Your praise is greatly appreciated. Nozomi: Oh, that reminds me. I'm sure everybody's worried about you, so let them know you're back on your feet, okay? Kousei: Good idea. Suzune: Mhh, tastes fine. Thanks. Kousei: Alright. I'll get to work on the next batch. Kanna: Good morning, you guys! Kousei: Ah! Suzune: Hey there, Kanna-san. Kousei: O-Oh, uh... hi, Akizuki-san. Kanna: Having naughty thoughts first thing in the morning again, are we? My goodness. Nihihi! Kanna: (Calm down, Kanna! Just calm down! Do not panic!) Kanna: (If Takamine-san sees me like this, he's going to get the wrong idea.) Kanna: (I'm a Grim Reaper. It would cause nothing but trouble if I were to lead him on like that... Alright.) Kanna: Ahem. Good morning, Takamine-san. Kousei: Yeah. Good morning. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Huh? O-Oh. Sorry. Kanna: Takamine-san... You weren't having any weird fantasies again, were you? Kousei: Hahaha. Don't be ridiculous. Kanna: You're acting awfully suspicious. Kousei: I mean, can you blame me after what we did yesterday? Kousei: Easier said than done... Kousei: The more you tell me not to worry about it, the harder it is to actually do. Kanna: I understand that, but still... Kousei: ...... Kanna: ...... Suzune: *stare* Kousei: Er... Could you please stop staring at us? Suzune: Stop making me out to be the bad guy here. Suzune: Something happen yesterday between you two? You mentioned feeling awkward. Suzune: Don't tell me that \"visit\" was just an excuse for you two to get it on or something? Kanna: We did nothing of the sort! I only went to check up on him! It was just a normal visit!  Kousei: What?! THAT was normal for you? It was my first time... *blush*... Kanna: Don't test me! Kousei: Sorry, sorry. Bad joke. Kousei: Anyway, it's not what you're thinking. All she did was cook me omelet rice. Kousei: But enough about that. Let's get back to work. We've gotta hurry or we won't make in time for opening. Suzune: Well, whatever. As long as it doesn't impact your work. Kanna: I'd better start getting the dining floor ready too. Kanna: By the way, Takamine-san. Would you come see me later when you have some time? There's something I'd like to check with you. Kousei: Alright, sure... Suzune: Hmm... I'm not sure you'll have the time. You need to get to class soon, don't you? Kousei: Oh, right. I didn't realize the time. Suzune: Go on. Get outta here before you're late. Kousei: Alright. Just let me finish up here before I leave. Kousei: Okay. Let's get going. Kanna: Takamine-san? Thank goodness I caught you before you left. Kousei: Are you taking a break? Or is there some kind of problem? Kanna: Did you forget what I told you this morning? I wanted to check something with you. Kousei: Oh, right... Sorry. I was so focused on work that I totally forgot. Kousei: You want to check on my soul, right? Kanna: Yes. I want make sure everything's okay, just to be safe. Kousei: So, uh... are we gonna do the forehead thing again? Kanna: Yes... we are. Otherwise I won't be able to tell. Kanna: But don't worry. I won't make a fool of myself like yesterday. I've calmed down a bit since last night, so I promise not to go shouting about sex and whatnot again. Kanna: I can't guarantee I won't get embarrassed, though... Kousei: Well, as long as you're fine with it, I don't mind. Kousei: In fact, this is my life and health we're talking about here. I should be begging you to do it. Kousei: Thanks. And sorry for making you deal with my problems all the time. Kanna: Oh, don't worry about that. It has always been my job to look after your well-being, after all... And besides, I'm rather enjoying myself. Kousei: You are? Kanna: Yeah. It's kind of like... all this time, I've done nothing except guiding the souls of the dead, performing my duties as a Grim Reaper. Kanna: Not to say I dislike my job as Grim Reaper, though. I think it's a very important responsibility. Kousei: Ah... I guess I understand where you're coming from. Kanna: Not to mention phone shopping, eating yakiniku, and taking pictures of everyday things. Kanna: But all of it has been incredibly fun. Kanna: So please, don't hesitate to let me know if you ever need something. It doesn't have to be anything Grim Reaper-related either. I'll be happy just to hear from you. Kousei: Alright. Kanna: O-Oh, goodness! I didn't mean to prattle on for so long! I'm not going to make you late for class, am I? Kousei: Nah, I'm fine. I've still got another ten minutes to spare. Kousei: ...... Kousei: I can't believe how sensitive I am. It's gross. Hiroto: What are you talking to yourself about? Hiroto: Is your head still not working right? Kousei: Hmm... You're not exactly wrong. Kousei: But I'm not sick like I was yesterday. Natsume: Really? Well, that's good. Hiroto: Ahh! G-God, you scared me. Kousei: Shiki-san? How long have you been standing there? Natsume: I just got here. I'm glad to hear you're feeling better. Kousei: Thanks. Natsume: What's wrong with you today, though? Kousei: I don't know if there's something wrong with me, per se... Kousei: Well... Hiroto: Then what? Spit it out already. Kousei: I think there's... a girl that I like. Natsume: Whoa, really? Who is it? You have to tell me. Hiroto: Didn't expect you of all people to be so curious about something like this, Shiki-san. Natsume: Oh, shoot. I'd like to hear more, but I'm going to be late for class... Natsume: Can we meet up again after class? I want to hear all the juicy details about this. Hiroto: Good idea. We should find a quieter place and time for this. Kousei: We've gotta get back to the cafe after class, though. Natsume: We can spare a little bit of time, surely. I'll call ahead to let the others know. Kousei: Yeah, sort of. Natsume: Oh-ho. Let me take a guess then... Is it Akizuki-san? Kousei: You knew? Natsume: Well, by process of elimination, it had to be her. Hiroto: Akizuki-san... Isn't she that girl you went phone shopping with? Hiroto: I mean, she is pretty attractive... I'm not surprised you have a crush on her. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Ahhhhhh! Hiroto: Why are you squirming around all of a sudden? Kousei: I dunno. But just thinking about her makes my heart race... Natsume: What are you, a teenage girl? Hiroto: I won't lie, you're acting kinda creepy. Kousei: It's not my fault. This is the first time I've ever felt this way... Natsume: Again, that's a textbook teenage-girl-in-love line. Hiroto: Stop blushing like that. It ain't cute. Kousei: Trust me, nobody's more surprised about this than I am. I never imagined I'd fall head over heels for someone like this, the way they do in manga. Kousei: This... must be what true love feels like. Hiroto: Kousei... Hiroto: Urgh! I can't believe you actually just said that! I'm gonna fucking die of cringe! Kousei: Shuddup! Natsume: Don't tease him. I know it sounds cringey, but his feelings are genuine. Natsume: I'm getting second-hand embarrassment just from listening to this too, but remember, his feelings are genuine. Kousei: You're teasing me just as much as he is. Hiroto: So? You gonna ask her out? Kousei: Nah, it's way too soon for that. Hiroto: But you should probably make some kinda move. Even Nonaka-kun's putting himself out there. Kousei: I mean, sure... but it could affect our work relationship from now on... Hiroto: Maybe, but if you let that stop you, you're never gonna get anywhere. Hiroto: If all you do is make excuses, your relationship's gonna stay the same forever. Kousei: I mean, I get that, but still... Natsume: Instead of confessing to her out of the blue, why don't you ask her out on a date first? Hiroto: Oh, yeah! You can go on a date for Christmas! Kousei: But we're selling our limited-edition Yule Logs on Christmas day. Kousei: Even now, I'm being forced to spend my free time practicing making them over and over until Suzune-san's satisfied. Kousei: I'll probably be spending the entire day on Christmas rolling those cakes into logs... I hope I don't get tendinitis. Natsume: Well, what about tomorrow then? The cafe's going to be closed, so you won't have to worry about work. Hiroto: Just ask her out, man. Kousei: H-Hrmm... Hiroto: Sheesh. Grow a pair, will you? Kousei: I mean, you can't just spring this on me all of a sudden... I don't even have time to come up with a plan. Natsume: You'll be fine; it's the holiday season. As long as you go someplace where you can see Christmas lights, it'll seem like a proper date. Hiroto: Still, it's better to decide these sorts of things sooner rather than later. Hiroto: For reference, what kind of Christmas date would you want to go on, as the girl here, Shiki-san? Natsume: I wouldn't want to go out. Too many people. Hiroto: So you'd prefer a stay-at-home date? Natsume: Honestly, just because it's Christmas doesn't mean you absolutely have to go on a date. Hiroto: Not a big fan of the holidays, are you? Natsume: If you ask me, guys are the ones who put too much importance on the holidays. Natsume: Dealing with huge crowds and long lines is nothing but stress. Hardly my idea of a fun date. Hiroto: I mean, yeah, but Christmas only comes once a year. Kousei: What do you suggest then, Hiroto? Hiroto: Me? Hmm... Oh, fine. Hiroto: I was actually going to use this myself... but I'll let you in on my special date plan. Kousei: Ohh! That'd be awesome! Hiroto: The key is to be romantic. And surprises are important too. Kousei: Right. Hiroto: And when it comes to Christmas dates--presents are an absolute must. Jewelry would be a good choice. Hiroto: But wait! I know what you're thinking. An ordinary gift like that isn't going to win any hearts. Hiroto: That's why it's critical to pick something that conveys your true feelings. Kousei: What kind of jewelry, specifically? Hiroto: Why, a necklace that spells out the word \"love,\" of course! Apparently, a ton of places even do custom-made orders these days! Hiroto: It's the ultimate heartfelt Christmas present that combines both romance and surprise! Genius, isn't it?! Natsume: You're a freak. Hiroto: What the hell was that for?! Natsume: If someone gave me a love necklace for Christmas, I'd be pretty turned off. Hiroto: Surely giving a girl such a unique and memorable gift would increase your chances of success when confessing to her, though. Natsume: Why would you ever think that? Natsume: Unless that girl is a rapper, or the famous samurai Naoe Kanetsugu, I doubt they'd want a necklace like that. Hiroto: That's not true! The most widely accepted theory is that Naoe Kanetsugu's armor was decorated with the character for \"love\" in tribute to the Buddhist deity of martial arts, not because-- Natsume: Nobody cares. Hiroto: F-Fine! Then how about city-gazing?! Like, at night! Hiroto: Walking around looking at Christmas lights isn't a bad idea either, but for a fashionable girl who doesn't wear sneakers, that might take a bit of a toll on her feet! Natsume: That's pretty considerate of you, actually. Hiroto: So here's what you do. You book a room at some high-class hotel, then as the two of you are gazing out at the city lights, you come up and hug her gently from behind. Natsume: Why would he book a hotel for them? They're not even dating. Hiroto: Finally, for the finishing blow, you whisper into her ear, \"Let's show this city what our love looks like.\" Natsume: God, I think I'm going to puke. Hiroto: It's foolproof! Whaddaya think?! Natsume: That's just plain disgusting! Are you completely incapable of coming up with any normal ideas? Hiroto: But he's gonna wanna show her that he's not like other guys! Natsume: Yes, in a GOOD way! Not by showing her that he's a disgusting creep! Natsume: Are you even listening to yourself? Cut it out before you make him do something he'll regret! Kousei: I think I'm starting to see why you're not very popular with girls. Hiroto: The hell'd you say?! Kousei: I doubt you even know how to ask a girl out period. Hiroto: Excuse you. I know perfectly well how. Hiroto: \"Hey, how's it goin'? So, listen. I know this is kinda random, but do you want to go eat somewhere with me? I know this great place. I was actually planning to go with my friends, but they canceled on me last minute.\" Hiroto: See? Piece of cake. Kousei: Let's turn to our commentator, Shiki Natsume, for a reaction. Natsume: That was atrocious. Hiroto: That was WAY too brutal! Natsume: I think you ought to reconsider your approach a little more. Hiroto: Urk. I've been told that before... Natsume: You don't need some lame excuse to ask a girl on a date. Just be upfront about what you want to do, and when you want to do it. Natsume: If you want to pull out this \"special plan\" of yours, at least save it for AFTER you've started dating... Not that it'd be any less gross then, but still. Hiroto: I'll keep that in mind. Natsume: That goes for you too, Takamine-kun. Don't try too hard. Just pick an activity you're comfortable with. Kousei: Hmm. Natsume: Maybe take her to a movie, or go window shopping. Just something ordinary. The important thing is to keep the mood enjoyable. Natsume: As long as you can do that, your relationship will naturally progress beyond being mere friends. Natsume: It won't be too late to do something special for her later on, if you feel like your relationship is starting to get into a rut. Hiroto & Kousei: Whoa... Hiroto: That's the Solitary Sniper for you. She's got way more experience with dating than we do, that's for sure. Natsume: ...... Hiroto: Oops. Sorry for calling you that. Natsume: It's okay. I know that's what people call me. But to be honest... Natsume: Despite everything I said, I don't actually have a lot of relationship experience... None at all, in fact. So take my advice with a grain of salt. Kousei: Still, I appreciate being able to get some sensible input from a real girl. Kousei: And thank you too, Hiroto. You've been a big help too. Hiroto: What, by being a bad example to learn from? Is that what you're trying to say? Kousei: No, I'm serious. Thanks for hearing me out. Kousei: If I had to deal with this myself, I might've done something really stupid. Natsume: Seriously? Kousei: My heart feels so warm. Kousei: It's been really hard to deal with lately. I can't seem to calm down whenever I look at Akizuki-san. Kousei: I want to talk with her about something--anything. I want to spend more time together with her. Natsume: You really are a teenage girl. Hiroto: He's down bad, that's for sure. Kousei: Anyway, my chest feels a bit lighter now. Thanks, you guys. Hiroto: If there's anything else you need, let me know anytime. Kousei: Just out of curiosity... What kind of Christmas present would you give a girl, Hiroto? Hiroto: I'd give her an engagement ring! No shit! An insanely expensive brand-name one! Combined with an intimate handwritten letter! Natsume: What did I just say about taking things slow?! Kousei: I can't let my nerves get to me. Kousei: Deep breaths, Kousei. Be natural. Be casual. Kousei: If I can manage that, I'll be fine. Yeah. Kousei: Hey, Suzune-san. I'm back from class. Suzune: Hey there. Kousei: Any orders I can work on? Suzune: I was just about to get started on these two plates of pancakes. Kousei: Let me handle them. You go ahead and take your break. Suzune: You sure? Well, okay. Give me a shout if you need anything. Kousei: Will do. Kousei: Now then. Kanna: Coming! Kousei: Ah! Kousei: Yeah, I'm back. Kousei: I'm feeling fine too, by the way. Suzune-san's on break right now, so I just finished up these pancakes for her. Kanna: That's great. Well, I'd better carry these out before they get cold. Kousei: Sure. Kousei: Before you go, though... Kousei: Er, never mind. Be careful not to trip and fall. Kanna: I won't do that. I'm not a child. Kousei: ...... Kousei: I shouldn't be asking her out while we're on the job. That'd be a distraction. Kousei: There's still time. I have plenty of chances to ask her out today! Kousei: And just like that, the day's over. Kousei: Guess I'll get changed. Kanna: Takamine-san? Do you have a minute? Kousei: Huh? Kanna: You seemed to be acting somewhat strange today. Are you alright? Kanna: Hmm... It doesn't seem as if there's anything wrong with your soul. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Well... that's because... Kousei: ...... Kanna: Tomorrow's our day off, isn't it? I don't have anything particular planned. Kousei: In that case, would you mind coming with me somewhere? There's someplace I want to go. Kanna: Where would that be? Kousei: I'll... have to tell you later. Kousei: But I want you to come with me. Kanna: Oh... okay then. I'll go with you. Kanna: Ah--is that why you were acting so funny the whole day? Kousei: I was trying to find the right moment to ask. Kanna: Oh, silly. You could've asked me that anytime. Kousei: I guess... I just didn't want to bother you while you were working and stuff, so... Kousei: A-Anyway, thank you. I'll see you tomorrow. Kanna: Right. I'm looking forward to it. Kousei: Great. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go outside...  Kanna: Huh? But you haven't finished changing yet. Kousei: Yeah, I know. I just need to step outside for a minute. Don't worry, I'll be right back. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Ngh... Kousei: Let's goooooooooo! I did it! Kousei: I was freaking out like crazy... Kousei: But... she said yes. Kanna: So that's the gist of it. You don't have any problem with us going out tomorrow, do you? Mikado: Hmm... You are free to do as you please, of course. Mikado: But I daresay that sounds like a date to me. Kanna: Huh? In what way? Mikado: The two of you are going out together, just the two of you. Kanna: Yeah... but we were alone that time we went out to buy me a phone too. Mikado: Be that as it may, tomorrow is the so-called Eve of Christmas Eve. Kanna: I mean, I suppose it is... Mikado: Since the cafe is open on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, neither of you would be able to take the day off work. Mikado: Do you not think that is why he chose tomorrow specifically, the 23rd, to ask you out? Kanna: You're reading too much into it. It's just a coincidence that the date happened to align like that. Mikado: Well, don't say I did not warn you. Kanna: It's not like that. I'm sure he simply wants to hang out as friends. Kanna: Besides, I'm a Grim Reaper. Takamine-san knows that full well. Mikado: I hope that he does. Kanna: You worry too much, Mikado-san. He doesn't think of me like th-- Kanna: ...... Mikado: ...... Kanna: W-We should be getting to bed. Mikado: Indeed. Whatever Takamine Kousei is thinking, we have no way of knowing. We may as well go to sleep. Kanna: (A date on the Eve of Christmas Eve? Takamine-san asking me out on a date? He'd never! Haha!) Kanna: (I know it SOUNDS like a date, but it's not.) Kanna: (He just needs my help with something.) "

            "Kousei: Morning, everyone. Suzune: Hey. Kanna: Good morning, Takamine-san. Kousei: How are the Yule Logs coming along? Suzune: We're about 80\\% done, I think. Kousei: Is there anything I can help with? Suzune: Wanna start prepping the cheesecakes for me? You remember how to do it, don't you? Kousei: Yeah. Kanna: I'll help out as well. Just tell me what to do. Kousei: Aren't you helping with the Yule Logs, though? Kanna: We've already finished rolling them into log-shapes. All that's left is to add the external decorations, but only Suzune-san is skilled enough to do that. Suzune: I'll be fine. You can go ahead and help him. Kousei: Alright. Mei: Whoa! An actual Yule Log! It looks absolutely scrumptious! Nozomi: Are you finished making them? Suzune: For today, at least. Phew... My shoulders are killing me. Kanna: I'm not surprised. You had to put the finishing touches on all of them. Natsume: Well, they certainly turned out great. Thanks for all your hard work. Kousei: We're not very busy right now, so feel free to take a break if you want, Suzune-san. Suzune: Thanks. I'll take you up on that then. Kanna: Of course. Natsume: Now then, let's get these cakes boxed up. Nozomi & Mei: Okaaay! Mei: Welcome to Cafe Stella! Party of two? If you'd rather not wait, we do have a couple counter seats available right now. Would that be alright? Nozomi: Welcome to Cafe Stella! Ah, you placed an order for two Yule Logs under the name Ota? I'll have them ready for you in just a moment. Natsume: Two pancakes, a blend coffee, and a Guatemalan coffee? I'll have those right out to you. Natsume: Two coffees; house blend and Guatemalan, please. Mikado: Coming right up. Kanna: Oh, Natsume-san! I need to go fetch some more Yule Logs from the kitchen. Can you cover for me while I'm gone? Natsume: I'll go fetch them instead. I need to put in another order anyway. Kanna: Alright, that'd be great. Thank you. Kanna: I apologize for the delay, sir. We'll have them ready in just a minute, so please be patient. Natsume: Order coming in. Two plates of pancakes, please. Kousei: Got it. Suzune: How are the Yule Logs selling? Natsume: Fairly well. Most of the customers who've placed advance orders have arrived to pick them up too. Suzune: Phew. That's a relief... Kousei: Were you that worried? Suzune: Well, yeah. I don't know if they're pranks or what, but sometimes you'll get large orders and then the customer never comes to pick it up. Kousei: That kind of stuff actually happens? I've read stories online, but it's scary how easy it is for a single person to screw you over. Suzune: Fortunately, it doesn't look like that's the case this time. Suzune: Anyway, back to work. Pancakes, was it? Kousei: Yeah. I'll handle them. Suzune: You will? Well, okay. Natsume: I'd better get these Yule Logs delivered too. Suzune: I'll help you carry them. I want to see how our customers are doing anyway. Mei: Welcome to Cafe Stella! Miyama: Hello again. Mei: Oh? You're Yuina-chan's--ah, I beg your pardon. Hello there, Mister Miyama. Miyama: Oh, you don't need to be so formal. Miyama: Actually, I'm also here to pick up a cake that I ordered. Mei: A Yule Log, yes? Wait right here; I'll have it out to you in one moment. Suzune: Welcome. Miyama: Hello again. I just can't ignore your cakes, they're so good. Miyama: My daughter's been looking forward to this for a while too. She says no other cake shop will do. Suzune: I'm flattered. I sincerely hope it's to your liking. Miyama: Oh, no need to worry about that. I'm confident it will be every bit as delicious as all the others I've had before. I'm looking forward to it as well. Suzune: Thank you very much. Your praise means a lot to me. Miyama: Oh, and before I forget. Could I also get some shortcakes, fruit tarts... this cheesecake here... and some mousse cakes, as well? Miyama: Four of each. I'm planning to give them to a few acquaintances as gifts. I'd like more people to see how delicious your cakes are. Especially since it's Christmas Eve, you know. Suzune: Would you like us to include some sort of message? It wouldn't take much time to add a simple plaque to it. Miyama: Oh, no. They're just going to be small gifts for some of my coworkers. I have to get back there once I'm done here. Suzune: It seems like you'll have quite a lot to carry, though... Miyama: Maybe, but I'll manage somehow. The hospital is only a few minutes' walk from here. Suzune: Alright. Mei: Here you are, Mister Miyama. Suzune: Ah, Mei-san. He'd also like shortcakes, fruit tarts, cheesecakes, and champagne mousses. Four of each. Mei: O-Oh, sure! I'll add those to your order. Mei: Let's see... In that case, your total comes to 11,820 yen. Miyama: Alright. One second... Wait, where's my wallet? What? Miyama: Ahh, right. I put it in my bag earlier. Phew. There it is. Miyama: My apologies. Mei: No problem, sir. Now then, you paid with 12,000 yen, so your change comes to 180 yen. Here you are. Miyama: Thank you very much. Suzune: Since you've got quite a few cakes, we separated them into two boxes for you. Miyama: Thank you. Suzune: Thank you for coming, and have a good day. Mei: Come visit us again sometime! Mei: Is he going to be okay with all those cakes? He's not going to get sick, is he? Suzune: They're not all for him. He said he's giving them as gifts to some of his coworkers. Mei: Oh, that makes sense. I guess there's nothing to worry about then. Mei: Ah--welcome to Cafe Stella! Suzune: You know, honestly, it's a lot easier making cakes than dealing with customers. Kousei: How are things looking out there? Suzune: Excellent. Everyone seems as happy as a clam. Suzune: But more importantly, why don't you take a break soon? Things are starting to wind down now. Kousei: Alright. Just let me finish up with this and I will. Kousei: Phew... Mikado: Understood. In that case, we will hold on to it for the meantime. Kousei: Yeah. Mikado: Yes... Yes... Kousei: Is there some kind of problem? Nozomi: Apparently one of our customers forgot something at the cafe, so they called to make sure it's still here. Nozomi: Yeah. They left in a rush so they wouldn't be holding up any other customers. You know how busy the cafe is today, with everyone coming in to pick up their cakes. Mikado: I understand. We'll be waiting. Goodbye. Nozomi: Are they coming back to get it? Mikado: Yes. However, he says that he is rather busy at work at the moment, so he does not know when that will be. Kousei: Then should we keep the bag in the fridge in the meantime? Mikado: No need. I am told it merely contains a Christmas present for his daughter. Kousei: Oh. But if so, he'll need to come get it by tonight. Kousei: As a parent, he's got to be feeling pretty anxious. Nozomi: Probably, yeah. Mikado: Hmm. Would you be willing to deliver it to him for us, Takamine Kousei? Nozomi: Oh, you're right! We can just bring it to him instead! Kousei: I guess I don't mind. Does he live around here? Mikado: You remember the little girl named Miyama Yuina who came to order a cake for her father's birthday, don't you? Mikado: The customer who forgot this present is her father. Kousei: Ahh. So that means I'll be going to the Miwa General Hospital? Mikado: Indeed. It might ruin the surprise for little Yuina if you were to deliver to their house instead. Nozomi: That's probably why her dad wanted to come pick it up himself. Mikado: Yes. Kousei: But that's enough reminiscing. I have a job to do. Kousei: No, I'm looking for a Dr. Miyama. I'm here to return something he forgot. Female Nurse: Ahh. Yes, I've been told. Female Nurse: Please give me a moment. He said he'd like to thank you in person. Female Nurse: He says he'll be with you in a minute. Would you mind waiting? It won't be long. Kousei: Sure. Kousei: Huh? Oh, I'm sorry. I was spacing out a little. Miyama: That's quite alright. I'm the one who should be apologizing. Some father I am, forgetting my own daughter's Christmas present. Miyama: Thank you for returning it to me. I truly appreciate it. Kousei: It was no big deal. Kousei: Can I ask you a question, though? These drawings--they haven't always been here, have they? Miyama: Oh, have they not? They were here when I first started working here. ???: Oh? Dr. Miyama? What are you doing out here? "

A duke, no less. Mikado: Indeed... Indeed I am... Kanna: But of course, we won't force you. Kanna: If you're too chicken, we'll just give up on the idea. Mikado: Hmph! Please. Nothing could be simpler for a nobleman such as I. Kanna: So you'll allow us to take your picture? Mikado: Indeed. I shall show you the difference in class between a regular cat and a Cat Sidhe!

Natsume: In that case, we'd better take as many photos now, while we can. Kanna: I agree. Strike while the iron's hot. Kanna: You Excellency? Why don't we take a little test photo? Mikado: This instant? I would like to groom my fur beforehand, if possible... Kousei: What are you, a girl? Natsume: Don't worry, Your Excellency. Your fur is always impeccable.

Mei: Hehe. I'll be sure to let my grandma know. Have as many as you want! Suzune: Hey, Kousei! Is it ready yet? I'm already getting full from all these kelp rolls! Kousei: Sorry for the wait. I just finished now. Mei: But you added some kind of smoked ingredient, didn't you? Kousei: You'll see. Go ahead and try it. Suzune: Uh-huh. Mei: ...... Suzune: ...... Mei: Oh? Suzune: Something tastes different. It's a lot more fragrant when I bite into it. Mei: It can't be the bacon, right? Where's this smoky flavor coming from? Suzune: It doesn't seem to be the vegetables, either... What exactly did you do? Kousei: It's the black pepper. That's what I smoked. Mei: Ohh! It's the seasoning! Kousei: Yeah. In a way, black pepper is actually the main ingredient in carbonara. That's where the name of the dish comes from, in fact. Suzune: It's derived from the Italian word for charcoal burner, right? Because there's supposed to be so much pepper on it that it turns black. Kousei: Exactly. I was contemplating whether or not to smoke the salt, but I thought that would change the flavor too much. Kousei: So I decided to smoke the pepper instead. This way it adds a nice kick without destroying the balance of the dish. Suzune: You're right. It really does add a nice kick. It's amazing how a small addition can make such a big difference. Suzune: Even though the seasoning is fundamentally the same, the flavor has a lot more depth. Mei: This is amazing! Just like authentic carbonara! Not that I know what authentic carbonara tastes like, but still! Kousei: Glad you like it. I only just finished smoking the pepper, so the smell might be a little harsh-- Kousei: But as long as I let it sit for a while, it should disappear. Then all I need to do is mix it with some regular black pepper to fine tune the flavor. Suzune: Sounds good. It could use a bit of adjusting, but I definitely think this is good enough to serve to our customers. In all honesty, this really is delicious. Kousei: Thanks. What about you-- Mei: Phew! That was good! Kousei: Wow. Not even a crumb left. Mei: It was too good! Just like real Italian cuisine! Not that I know what real Italian cuisine tastes like, but still! Suzune: You already said that earlier. I get what you're trying to say, though. Kousei: Ahaha... I wasn't expecting this much of a reaction. I'm flattered. Mei: Seriously, it was delicious! You're a genius, Senpai! Kousei: O-Oh stop it... Suzune: Well, since Mei-san is showering you in praise, I'm going to be a little more critical. Suzune: Like you said before, the dish still needs some balancing. Kousei: I know. It's got a pretty strong flavor, so I'm gonna try letting it mellow overnight next time. Suzune: Instead of trying to figure out everything on your own, though, you should ask the others at the cafe to taste-test your dish first. Suzune: Then you can decide if you want to tone it down, or if you actually want to emphasize that distinct flavor. Mei: Ohh, I see! The more unique it tastes, the more likely it is to grab people's interest! Suzune: Exactly. But you might get differing opinions on which one is better, which'll make it harder to decide. Suzune: Still, it's up to you. At the very least, I don't think anyone's going to object to you adding this dish to our menu. Kousei: Alright. I'll give it a shot. Kousei: And thanks, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Huh? Kousei: I wouldn't have come up with this idea without you, so thanks. Mei: Please! All I did was suggest the first thing that came to mind. Mei: Don't underestimate your own genius, Senpai! This really is amazing! Kousei: Th-Thanks. Suzune: Ahem. Kousei: Wh-What? Suzune: We're all out of cheese and sausages, so I'm gonna need you to make me some more. Kousei: You already ate them all? I wanted some too, you know. Suzune: Oh, stop griping. C'mon! Kousei: Alright, alright. Fine. Mei: Senpai! I want to try smoking some other things too! Kousei: Sure. I'll rummage around my fridge and see what else we can toss in the smoker. Mei: This is gonna be great! Kanna: Here's to another great year! Let's all do our best! Suzune: Alrighty. Ready to get back to work? Kousei: Yes, ma'am. Kousei: Not so much changed as added a new twist. I tried smoking the pepper first. Natsume: I can't say it looks or smells particularly different, though... Kousei: You'll see once you try it. Nozomi: Well, I'm gonna go ahead and dig in! Nozomi: That faint hint of smokiness... It's amazing how much difference it makes. Natsume: You said you smoked it yourself? Kousei: Yep. It was all Hiuchidani-san's idea. Mei: Don't be silly. You came up with the idea to smoke the black pepper. Mei: All I did was suggest that we try to make our own bacon. Natsume: Ah. So you spent the break thinking up ways to improve our menu... Natsume: That's very commendable of you. I'm impressed. Kousei: Thanks. How do you think it tastes? Kanna: I, for one, think it's delicious. It gives the dish a lot more added depth. Nozomi: I think so too. This seems like it'd be a real crowd-pleaser. Natsume: It certainly is delicious, but... Kousei: But? Natsume: I feel like the pepper's unique smokiness has a sort of... mature taste to it. Natsume: It's definitely not bad by any means, but--and this is just my personal opinion... Natsume: But I think I actually prefer the regular carbonara. Natsume: So while I'm all for adding this to our menu, I don't think it should replace the original version. Nozomi: You said you added the smoked black pepper to the pasta at the end, right? Kousei: Yeah, I did. Nozomi: In that case, why don't we just serve our regular carbonara with a shaker of smoked black pepper on the side? Nozomi: That way, customers can add as much or as little as they want. Natsume: How would we know how much to prepare in advance, though? Some customers might use a lot more than others. Suzune: A lot of beef bowl restaurants used to do the same thing with their special shichimi spices, but they had to stop the practice a little while back. Suzune: Some customers were using unbelievable amounts of spice, which ended up hurting their profits. Nozomi: Oh... I guess that won't work then. Kanna: It seems like our safest option would be to add this smoked pepper version as a separate item on the menu. Kousei: Alright. So I have all the judges' approval? Kanna: Absolutely. I think this would make a fine addition to our menu. Nozomi: Me too. Natsume: Me three. Kanna: What do you think, Mikado-san? Mikado: I believe Natsume mentioned earlier that this dish had a rather mature taste. However, many of our customers also come here specifically for our coffee and tea. Mikado: Judging from what I have gathered, this would suit their preferences well. Mikado: Therefore, I am in agreement. Kousei: Thank goodness... Mei: Way to go, Senpai! Kousei: Thanks! Kousei: I was just gonna do it at home, actually... Mikado: Among other problems, that would be quite expensive. I would not recommend you do that. Kousei: I guess that's true. Mikado: I do have some other ideas you may wish to consider. Are you free to talk after this? Kousei: Sure. I've got time. Kanna: In that case, let's call it a day here. See you tomorrow, everyone. Natsume: See you tomorrow. Nozomi: See you tomorrow! Kousei: Phew... Kousei: Huh? Hiuchidani-san? Mei: Hey. Kousei: What are you still doing here? Mei: I was waiting for you to finish. Kousei: You could've waited inside. Mei: Ahaha. I didn't want to bother you guys. Mei: Anyway, I know I should've said something earlier... but would you mind walking me home? Kousei: Sure. I don't mind. Let's go. Mei: Thanks! Mei: Congratulations on getting your new recipe approved, by the way. Kousei: Well, you helped with that. Mei: Not at all. You did this on your own, Senpai. Kousei: Nah, it's all thanks to you. I would've never come up with this idea on my own. Kousei: Seriously, thank you. I'm really grateful. Kousei: This might sound kind of melodramatic... but I think I've gained a little more confidence in myself now. Mei: Ehehe... You're gonna make me blush. I don't mean to sound melodramatic either, but, like... Mei: You've done a lot for me as well, Senpai. Ever since you've helped me open up about my left eye, I feel like a huge weight's been lifted off my shoulders. Mei: That's why I wanted to be able to return the favor if I could. Mei: I'm glad I managed to be of some small help to you. Kousei: It wasn't small at all. You were a big help. Kousei: I was hoping to do something like this before I had to deal with my exams, so I'm glad it all went so well. Mei: Oh, your exams are coming up? Kousei: At the end of the month, yeah. Mei: Does that mean you're gonna be working fewer hours? Kousei: No, I'll be working the same as usual. I'll do fine as long as I pay attention in class. Kousei: And I can always study after work too. Mei: You're a pretty diligent student, aren't you? Kousei: I don't know about that... I'm just the sort of guy who hates procrastinating. Mei: That's what it means to be diligent, Senpai. I think that's something to be proud of. Kousei: Nah, trust me... I can be pretty lazy when I want. Mei: But in front of me, at least, you're always hardworking and dependable. Kousei: Okay, sheesh. Stop flattering me. It's gonna go to my head. Mei: Ahaha! Alright. Mei: Well, good night, Senpai. Kousei: Good night. And sorry you had to wait for me earlier. Mei: That's okay. I waited because I wanted to congratulate you. Mei: Anyway, see you tomorrow! Kousei: Yeah. See you tomorrow. Mei: ...... Mei: Hmm... Exams... "

Suzune: I'm flattered, but I doubt anyone's waiting in line for us to open. We're not offering any limited-time promotions or anything. Suzune: I'm hoping we get a lot of customers too, but let's not bite off more than we can chew. Suzune: No matter how much we've practiced things, the real deal won't be the same. Kousei: Still, we've reached over 500 followers on Instogram now, so I'd say we've garnered some attention. Mikado: Is that high? Kousei: Well, Hiuchidani-san said it was pretty amazing. It has only been less than a month since we started, and we've only just opened. Mikado: I see. In that case, perhaps we can raise our expectations a little. Kousei: Apparently, our follow count experienced a sudden surge these past few days. Kousei: All thanks to those pictures of you we posted, I'm sure. Mikado: Y-You don't say? Heh. I must say, I did not expect so many people to appreciate my sophistication. Suzune: Even so, our followers could be from anywhere around the globe. There's no guaranteeing they all live in the area. Suzune: If you get yourself too excited, you're just asking to be let down. Kousei: Not very optimistic, are you? Suzune: Ah, sorry. I didn't mean to be a wet blanket. Suzune: I just know how cruel reality can be from personal experience, so I guess I've gotten into the habit of thinking pragmatically. Sorry. Natsume: You don't have to apologize for that. You made a valid point. Natsume: Reality can certainly be unforgiving. But that's why we need to be focused on putting a smile on the face of everyone who walks through our door! Natsume: Once we can do that, people will be lining up outside our cafe in no time at all. Suzune: Yeah, that's exactly what I was trying to say! Kousei: Feels like you're just piggybacking on what she said, though. Suzune: Look, I'm just trying to pep everyone up! Mikado: In any case, both Sumizome-kun and Hiuchidani-kun have classes all morning, so we will be somewhat short-staffed for the time being. Best to keep that in mind. Kousei: Right. The last thing we want to do is inconvenience our customers. Mikado: It is approaching ten now, is it not? Kanna: I'll go flip the door sign to \"Open.\" Natsume: Ah--let me do that. I want to be the one to open the cafe today. Kanna: Of course. By all means. Natsume: *sigh*... We're really open. The day's finally here. Natsume: No, now's not the time to be getting sentimental. This is where the real challenge begins. Let's do this. ???: Finally open, are you? Natsume: Yes! Please, come in! Natsume: We have a customer! Kanna & Suzune & Kousei: Welcome to Cafe Stella! Kazufumi: Oh, it definitely has gotten brighter in here. Both the place and the people. Kazufumi: Hey, guys! I'm here for the big day. Kousei: Welcome. Please, have a seat. Kazufumi: Thanks.

            "Mei: Phew. I thought I was running late, but it looks like you arrived at the same time as me. Kousei: Yeah, I just got out of class. Kousei: Shiki-san and Nozomi should already be here, so let's head inside. Mei: Okay. Mei: Good morning! Kanna: Welcome, you two. Mei: It's a little weird being greeted with a \"Welcome\" when the cafe's closed. Kanna: Then by that logic, saying \"Good morning\" is weird too, no? We're not working. Mei: I guess that's true. Kanna: You're here to study for your exams, right? Natsume-san and Nozomi-san are already here. Kousei: Yeah, sorry. Nozomi: It's fine. You two were in class. Natsume: You don't have to apologize. It's no big deal to us. Kanna: What would everyone like to drink? I'll prepare some refreshments. Nozomi: Huh? But... Kanna: It's no trouble at all. If it'll help you focus on your studies, I'd be happy to help. Nozomi: That's really nice of you. In that case, I'll have a cup of Earl Grey. Mei: Can I get a glass of orange juice? Kanna: Sure. Kanna: What about you two? Natsume: I'll have an Earl Grey too. Kousei: I'll have a coffee. Kanna: Alright. Kousei: Let's get to it then. Did you manage to find the stuff I asked for? Natsume: Here. These were the only ones I had left. Kousei: Thanks. These should help. Natsume: We might be in different majors, but you managed to get into Hitotsuboshi too, so you had to have gotten high grades yourself. Kousei: Well, I had a lot of help, as I'm sure you can imagine. Plus, my grades were only just barely good enough to be accepted. Nozomi: Urgh. These tests are crazy. I can't even figure out this last question with the answer in front of me. Mei: I'm getting a headache just looking at it. Kousei: Yeah, there are quite a few nasty questions in here. Natsume: You can thank my teacher, Saeki-sensei, for that. Apparently, he was a huge math buff. Natsume: Rumor had it he made these questions specifically to be solved using applied mathematics, just to show students the beauty of mathmatics. Nozomi: I'm going to go out on a limb and say he didn't succeed. Natsume: Yeah, most of us couldn't stand his class. Not that we hated him, per se; he was a fine person, just his tests were awful. Mei: That's what I hear too. Kousei: This teacher still teaches there? Mei: Yeah, he sure does. Kousei: Well, these tests should be great reference material then. Kousei: As for the English ones, all these questions seem pretty standard. Natsume: At least when I was there, the only subject that had insanely difficult questions was math. Kousei: Good. Then as long as we use these tests and the textbook to review, you should be able to avoid failing. Natsume: Sounds like a lot of rote memorization, though. Kousei: It'll have to do, for now. There's not enough time for her to re-learn all the material. Mei: Thank you very much. Nozomi: At the moment, I guess I'm struggling with Natsume-san's math questions the most. Nozomi: An in-depth explanation would really help. Natsume: Alright. I'll walk you both through it, so listen up. Nozomi: Okay! Mei: I'm all ears. Mei: Thank you! Nozomi: Sorry for the trouble. And thanks. Natsume: Thank you for doing this, Akizuki-san. Natsume: So anyway--if I apply this formula here, using the value I calculated above, that should give me the answer. Does that make sense? Nozomi: Ahh, I see. Now that you explain it like that, I sort of understand... Maybe... Maybe not? Mei: You're amazing, Nozomi-chan. I still don't get it at all! Natsume: Well, that's no surprise. You're learning from scratch. Natsume: I'll try to explain it as simply as I can, okay? But let me know right away if there's something you don't understand. Mei: Okaaay... *sigh*... Kousei: You're sighing way too much. Natsume: If you're not having any trouble with what I just explained, Sumizome-san, you can go ahead and start studying something else. Nozomi: Well, I wouldn't say I fully understand it yet. Nozomi: Alright, though. Can I borrow your English test? I want to use it to study. Natsume: Be my guest. Mei: Sorry I'm delaying us, Nozomi-san. Nozomi: Hey, it's not a big deal. Nozomi: The whole reason we're having this study session is to learn! Nozomi: So let's work hard and do our best to pass, okay? Mei: Yeah! Kanna: And here's your coffee, Takamine-san. Kousei: Oh, thanks. Kanna: By the way, what are you doing? Kousei: I'm putting together a list of stuff I want to cover. Kanna: Oh, okay. Preparing your teaching materials. Would you like me to help? Kousei: You'd be willing? Kanna: Don't worry. I can at least help you organize everything. Kanna: Everyone's studying their hardest. I want to chip in to help too. Kousei: Alright. Grab a seat. Kanna: Thank you. Nozomi: Kousei-kun, can I ask you something? Kousei: What's up? Nozomi: How come the answer to this one is number two? The other choices sound like they make sense too. Kousei: Hm? Let me see. Ah. Well, if you look at the paragraph before the blank, you can tell whether it's a factual or hypothetical statement. Kousei: The question is asking about something that happened in the past, so the answer has to be number two. Number one is a conjunction, so that wouldn't make sense. See? There's a comma here. Nozomi: Oh, you're right! Urk... Why didn't I catch that? Kousei: It's an easy mistake to make. This whole section can be a little tricky. Kousei: But it's something you need to know. You'll find these sorts of questions on the English proficiency test as well. Nozomi: Really? Alright, thanks. I'd better study it some more then. Kanna: You're actually quite smart, aren't you, Takamine-san? Nozomi: You wouldn't think it, would you? We've known each other for ages, and he always helps me study for tests, but even I still can't believe it sometimes. Nozomi: I never see him cramming at home, so I have no idea how his grades are so good. Kousei: Hey, I put in the effort just like everybody else. Kanna: Is that true? Kousei: The most efficient way to retain information is to pay attention in class. That, and taking notes. Kousei: If I do that, a single glance is all it takes to remember what I learned, which also helps me cut down on review time. Kanna: More haste, less speed, as they say. Nozomi: He's been saying that stuff for years. But if it was that easy to pay attention in class, we wouldn't be asking for help in the first place. Nozomi: Ugh, I can't do this. My concentration is shot. Mei: Me too. It feels like my brain is about to burn out... *sputter* *sputter*... Natsume: Oh, it's getting quite late. Alright. Let's call it a day. Mei: *siiigh* Thank you very much... Nozomi: Thank you! Natsume: You're welcome. So what do you think? Feeling a little more confident now? Mei: Uhh, yeah. I think I understand a bit more now... sort of. Natsume: Ah. Well, I'm glad my explanations made sense to you. Mei: I'll try reviewing everything again once I get home. Natsume: If there's anything you don't understand, let me know. Natsume: Even if it's something we've gone over already, don't be embarrassed. It happens sometimes. Mei: Okay. Thank you for your help. Kousei: Why don't we get you to take the same tests Shiki-san lent us tomorrow? Kousei: After you review the questions you get wrong, you can retake them again the next day. Natsume: I think that's a good idea too. Mei: But, like, won't I just be solving the same questions over and over? Natsume: There's nothing wrong with that. The worst thing would be for you to only think you understand. Kousei: Yeah, the goal here is to make sure you comprehend what you're learning. Kousei: If you can get the same grades Shiki-san did, you should be able to pass your exams without a hitch. But simply memorizing her answers won't mean anything. Mei: Yes, I know. Kousei: Are you okay with that too, Nozomi? Nozomi: Sounds good to me. Natsume: Starting tomorrow, I want you to come in to the cafe even on your days off. Kousei: We'll be able to help you study if you use the break room. Though it'll have to be while we're on the job. Mei: Alright. Thank you kindly. Kanna: Also, take these. I made copies of all your English and Japanese history study materials. Nozomi: Thank you so much! Kousei: Japanese history will largely be pure memorization, but for English, make sure you think about your answers carefully and review them. Mei: I will. Kousei: And thanks for helping out too, Akizuki-san. Kanna: Not at all. Helping people in need is also a part of my job now. Mei: Thanks for everything today. Natsume: Don't thank us just yet. Thank us once you've passed your exams. Mei: True. Alright then! I'll do my best! Nozomi: I'm hooome. Rokurou: Welcome back, Nozomi. Rokurou: Pretty late today, aren't you? I thought you didn't have work on Wednesdays. Nozomi: I was studying with a friend today. Kousei-kun and one of my coworkers were helping us prepare for our mid-terms. Nozomi: I wasn't playing around, so relax. Rokurou: That's not really what I'm worried about... Rokurou: I'm glad to see you working so hard, but make sure you don't overdo it. Rokurou: You've been staying up rather late these days, haven't you? Pulling all-nighters isn't good for your health. Nozomi: I know, geez. That's why I'm doing this now, so I don't have to stay up all night. Nozomi: Anyway, I'm going back to my room to do a bit more review. Rokurou: Don't you want to take a bath? Nozomi: Later. Nozomi: ...... Nozomi: ...... Nozomi: ... Nozomi: Nh... Ngh! Ahh, it's already this late? Nozomi: *sigh*... I studied a whole, whole lot. I've never been able to do this much on my own before. Nozomi: I'd better go take a bath now. If I don't get some sleep soon, I won't be able to wake up on time tomorrow. "

            "Kousei: Morning, everyone. Suzune: Hey. Kanna: Good morning, Takamine-san. Kousei: How are the Yule Logs coming along? Suzune: We're about 80\\% done, I think. Kousei: Is there anything I can help with? Suzune: Wanna start prepping the cheesecakes for me? You remember how to do it, don't you? Kousei: Yeah. Kanna: I'll help out as well. Just tell me what to do. Kousei: Aren't you helping with the Yule Logs, though? Kanna: We've already finished rolling them into log-shapes. All that's left is to add the external decorations, but only Suzune-san is skilled enough to do that. Suzune: I'll be fine. You can go ahead and help him. Kousei: Alright. Mei: Whoa! An actual Yule Log! It looks absolutely scrumptious! Nozomi: Are you finished making them? Suzune: For today, at least. Phew... My shoulders are killing me. Kanna: I'm not surprised. You had to put the finishing touches on all of them. Natsume: Well, they certainly turned out great. Thanks for all your hard work. Kousei: We're not very busy right now, so feel free to take a break if you want, Suzune-san. Suzune: Thanks. I'll take you up on that then. Kanna: Of course. Natsume: Now then, let's get these cakes boxed up. Nozomi & Mei: Okaaay! Mei: Welcome to Cafe Stella! Party of two? If you'd rather not wait, we do have a couple counter seats available right now. Would that be alright? Nozomi: Welcome to Cafe Stella! Ah, you placed an order for two Yule Logs under the name Ota? I'll have them ready for you in just a moment. Natsume: Two pancakes, a blend coffee, and a Guatemalan coffee? I'll have those right out to you. Natsume: Two coffees; house blend and Guatemalan, please. Mikado: Coming right up. Kanna: Oh, Natsume-san! I need to go fetch some more Yule Logs from the kitchen. Can you cover for me while I'm gone? Natsume: I'll go fetch them instead. I need to put in another order anyway. Kanna: Alright, that'd be great. Thank you. Kanna: I apologize for the delay, sir. We'll have them ready in just a minute, so please be patient. Natsume: Order coming in. Two plates of pancakes, please. Kousei: Got it. Suzune: How are the Yule Logs selling? Natsume: Fairly well. Most of the customers who've placed advance orders have arrived to pick them up too. Suzune: Phew. That's a relief... Kousei: Were you that worried? Suzune: Well, yeah. I don't know if they're pranks or what, but sometimes you'll get large orders and then the customer never comes to pick it up. Kousei: That kind of stuff actually happens? I've read stories online, but it's scary how easy it is for a single person to screw you over. Suzune: Fortunately, it doesn't look like that's the case this time. Suzune: Anyway, back to work. Pancakes, was it? Kousei: Yeah. I'll handle them. Suzune: You will? Well, okay. Natsume: I'd better get these Yule Logs delivered too. Suzune: I'll help you carry them. I want to see how our customers are doing anyway. Mei: Welcome to Cafe Stella! Miyama: Hello again. Mei: Oh? You're Yuina-chan's--ah, I beg your pardon. Hello there, Mister Miyama. Miyama: Oh, you don't need to be so formal. Miyama: Actually, I'm also here to pick up a cake that I ordered. Mei: A Yule Log, yes? Wait right here; I'll have it out to you in one moment. Suzune: Welcome. Miyama: Hello again. I just can't ignore your cakes, they're so good. Miyama: My daughter's been looking forward to this for a while too. She says no other cake shop will do. Suzune: I'm flattered. I sincerely hope it's to your liking. Miyama: Oh, no need to worry about that. I'm confident it will be every bit as delicious as all the others I've had before. I'm looking forward to it as well. Suzune: Thank you very much. Your praise means a lot to me. Miyama: Oh, and before I forget. Could I also get some shortcakes, fruit tarts... this cheesecake here... and some mousse cakes, as well? Miyama: Four of each. I'm planning to give them to a few acquaintances as gifts. I'd like more people to see how delicious your cakes are. Especially since it's Christmas Eve, you know. Suzune: Would you like us to include some sort of message? It wouldn't take much time to add a simple plaque to it. Miyama: Oh, no. They're just going to be small gifts for some of my coworkers. I have to get back there once I'm done here. Suzune: It seems like you'll have quite a lot to carry, though... Miyama: Maybe, but I'll manage somehow. The hospital is only a few minutes' walk from here. Suzune: Alright. Mei: Here you are, Mister Miyama. Suzune: Ah, Mei-san. He'd also like shortcakes, fruit tarts, cheesecakes, and champagne mousses. Four of each. Mei: O-Oh, sure! I'll add those to your order. Mei: Let's see... In that case, your total comes to 11,820 yen. Miyama: Alright. One second... Wait, where's my wallet? What? Miyama: Ahh, right. I put it in my bag earlier. Phew. There it is. Miyama: My apologies. Mei: No problem, sir. Now then, you paid with 12,000 yen, so your change comes to 180 yen. Here you are. Miyama: Thank you very much. Suzune: Since you've got quite a few cakes, we separated them into two boxes for you. Miyama: Thank you. Suzune: Thank you for coming, and have a good day. Mei: Come visit us again sometime! Mei: Is he going to be okay with all those cakes? He's not going to get sick, is he? Suzune: They're not all for him. He said he's giving them as gifts to some of his coworkers. Mei: Oh, that makes sense. I guess there's nothing to worry about then. Mei: Ah--welcome to Cafe Stella! Suzune: You know, honestly, it's a lot easier making cakes than dealing with customers. Kousei: How are things looking out there? Suzune: Excellent. Everyone seems as happy as a clam. Suzune: But more importantly, why don't you take a break soon? Things are starting to wind down now. Kousei: Alright. Just let me finish up with this and I will. Kousei: Phew... Mikado: Understood. In that case, we will hold on to it for the meantime. Kousei: Yeah. Mikado: Yes... Yes... Kousei: Is there some kind of problem? Nozomi: Apparently one of our customers forgot something at the cafe, so they called to make sure it's still here. Nozomi: Yeah. They left in a rush so they wouldn't be holding up any other customers. You know how busy the cafe is today, with everyone coming in to pick up their cakes. Mikado: I understand. We'll be waiting. Goodbye. Nozomi: Are they coming back to get it? Mikado: Yes. However, he says that he is rather busy at work at the moment, so he does not know when that will be. Kousei: Then should we keep the bag in the fridge in the meantime? Mikado: No need. I am told it merely contains a Christmas present for his daughter. Kousei: Oh. But if so, he'll need to come get it by tonight. Kousei: As a parent, he's got to be feeling pretty anxious. Nozomi: Probably, yeah. Mikado: Hmm. Would you be willing to deliver it to him for us, Takamine Kousei? Nozomi: Oh, you're right! We can just bring it to him instead! Kousei: I guess I don't mind. Does he live around here? Mikado: You remember the little girl named Miyama Yuina who came to order a cake for her father's birthday, don't you? Mikado: The customer who forgot this present is her father. Kousei: Ahh. So that means I'll be going to the Miwa General Hospital? Mikado: Indeed. It might ruin the surprise for little Yuina if you were to deliver to their house instead. Nozomi: That's probably why her dad wanted to come pick it up himself. Mikado: Yes. Kousei: But that's enough reminiscing. I have a job to do. Kousei: No, I'm looking for a Dr. Miyama. I'm here to return something he forgot. Female Nurse: Ahh. Yes, I've been told. Female Nurse: Please give me a moment. He said he'd like to thank you in person. Female Nurse: He says he'll be with you in a minute. Would you mind waiting? It won't be long. Kousei: Sure. Kousei: Huh? Oh, I'm sorry. I was spacing out a little. Miyama: That's quite alright. I'm the one who should be apologizing. Some father I am, forgetting my own daughter's Christmas present. Miyama: Thank you for returning it to me. I truly appreciate it. Kousei: It was no big deal. Kousei: Can I ask you a question, though? These drawings--they haven't always been here, have they? Miyama: Oh, have they not? They were here when I first started working here. ???: Oh? Dr. Miyama? What are you doing out here? "

            "Kousei: ...... Kousei: Speaking of which, it's almost White Day. Kousei: Thanks for the chocolate cake last time, everyone. Suzune: Speaking of which, we never heard what you thought of it, did we? Kousei: It was really good. Thanks for adding that hint of bitterness to it. Kanna: Nozomi-san told us you preferred it that way. Mei: Suzune-san was pretty much teaching us as we went along, but it really did turn out delicious! Suzune: You were sampling it way too much, though. Mei: Ahaha! Sorry about that. Kousei: Anyway, I wanted to give you guys these baked sweets as thanks. Nozomi: Very well. Nozomi: Wow, you got individual gifts for all of us? Thanks! Suzune: I kinda feel bad since we just gave you one thing from all of us. Kousei: It's fine. I just thought it'd look better if I wrapped everyone's gifts individually. Kousei: But seeing as I had to buy enough for all of you, the portions are a little small. Sorry. Mei: Oh, you don't have to worry about that. This is more than enough. Thank you. Kanna: Absolutely. It's the thought that counts, not the size of the gift. Nozomi: But speaking of size, that big gift you've got there must be for Natsume-san, right? Kousei: Well, yeah. Suzune: Are those baked goods as well? Kousei: Yeah. I also got her some tea leaves, and a couple other small accessories. Stuff like that. Kousei: She tends to dislike holidays that we're socially obliged to celebrate, see. Suzune: I doubt she'd be unhappy with a gift from her boyfriend. Kousei: Well, I hope so. Suzune: Honestly, she'd probably be MORE upset if you arbitrarily decided that she didn't want anything. Kanna: I agree. Mei: You have to be mindful of your girlfriend's feelings. Nozomi: No girl wants to think you've forgotten about her. Kousei: I'll take that advice to heart. Thanks. Natsume: I've got another order for you. A sandwich and a pancake with chocolate sauce, on the double. Kousei: Got it. Kousei: Can you make the sandwich, Suzune-san? Suzune: Sure. I'll get to it once I'm done cooking this. Kousei: Thanks. Kousei: Well, it is White Day. Suzune: Too bad you have to spend the day working, though. Kousei: No way around it, unfortunately. And I can always give Natsume her gift after work. Kousei: The stuff I got her isn't going to spoil anytime soon, so I'm in no rush. Suzune: Then how about this? As long as you keep up the good work, I'll handle the cleanup by myself so you can leave a little early. Kousei: ...... Suzune: What? Too grateful for words? Kousei: No. Just wondering if pigs are going to start flying. Suzune: Haha. Very funny, you little snot. Kousei: I'm just messing with you. No need to take it so seriously. Kousei: But are you sure about this? Suzune: Yeah, why not? It's not gonna kill me. And I'd hate to stand in the way of your relationship. Kousei: Thank you! Suzune: You scratch my back, I scratch yours; that's how it works. Anyway, get back to focusing on that frying pan. Kousei: Yes, ma'am! Nozomi: Order coming in! I need a strawberry pancake and a strawberry parfait, please! Kousei: Coming right up. Kousei: Thanks, boss. I'll leave the rest to you then. Kousei: My bad. I didn't think you were already changing. Natsume: You really need to be more careful. If another girl was changing in here, I would've crushed your eyeballs. Kousei: It's hard to tell if you're joking sometimes. Natsume: Anyway, the others insisted I go home early today. I think they were trying to be considerate of us. Natsume: Same thing happen to you, I assume? Kousei: I wouldn't say \"insisted\". Suzune-san just offered to take care of the cleanup for me. Natsume: Ah. Well, if they're willing to do all of this for us, I guess we might as well accept their kindness. Kousei: Yeah. Kousei: So, listen. I've got something for you, Natsume. Kousei: It's your White Day gift, but, umm... this is my first time giving my girlfriend anything like this. Kousei: So if you aren't happy with it, try not to get TOO upset at me. Natsume: Oh, relax. Don't start making excuses before I've even seen it. Kousei: Sure. Natsume: Let's see... Ohh, sweets. And tea leaves too? Wait, aren't these pretty expensive? Kousei: Well, it's a return gift. Kousei: White Day gifts are supposed to be three times the value of the gift received, right? Natsume: I hear people expect it to be five times, these days. Kousei: Seriously? Talk about greedy... Natsume: Well, some people, anyway. But I don't think an expensive gift necessarily makes for a better gift. Natsume: Rather than spending three times the money, I'd be happier if you spent three times as much time with me instead. Kousei: I'll remember that. Natsume: But that doesn't mean I'm not happy with this gift. Thanks. Natsume: Let's have some of this tea together next time. I'll brew it for you. Kousei: Sounds great. Natsume: Hm? There's something else in here... Natsume: ...... Natsume: What is this? A blindfold? Kousei: A little something extra. Natsume: Ahem. Kousei: I mean, you gave me an extra kiss with your chocolate too, remember? Kousei: And that meant I had to give you something worth three times as much. Kousei: So, after a lot of thinking, I came up with the idea of a blindfold... Do you like it? Natsume: What kind of question is that? Are you stupid? Kousei: Come on! How am I supposed to know what three times a kiss is worth?! Natsume: Well, yes, but a BLINDFOLD? Are you serious? Kousei: Doing it while blindfolded is pretty exciting, though. From what I've read, at least. Natsume: ...... Kousei: Hey, you promised you wouldn't get upset! Come on! Natsume: That's for me to decide, not you, Kousei. Kousei: Sorry. Natsume: *sigh*... Natsume: You really are a pervert. Kousei: ...... Natsume: So? When are we trying it out? Kousei: Wait. Really? Natsume: What? You don't want to? I thought you said it was... pretty exciting? Natsume: Oh, shut it. Kousei: Anyway... how about tonight? Kousei: ...... Kousei: O-Oh, sorry. I spaced out for a second there. Kousei: I gotta ask, though. Uhh, why are you wearing your uniform? Natsume: I thought you'd like it more if I did... Kousei: You must really think I'm some kind of pervert, Natsume. Kousei: I mean, I won't deny I like it. But still. Natsume: I'm starting to get kind of excited too. Kousei: I haven't even done anything yet, though. Natsume: It's pitch black in front of me, I can't see a thing, and my arms are tied too... Kousei: But you like it, don't you? Natsume: Well... I guess I do. Kousei: Natsume... Natsume: Don't worry. I can actually feel my way around... surprisingly easily. Kousei: Nhh... Ah... Natsume: *giggle*... You're already starting to moan. Kousei: Yeah, 'cause I'm ridiculously turned on right now. Natsume: I can see that. In fact... aren't you even bigger than usual? Kousei: I dunno... I can't really tell myself. Natsume: I can't believe seeing your girlfriend like this makes you this big... You really are a hopeless pervert. Kousei: Is it really that noticeable? Natsume: It is... See? Ahmph. Kousei: Ah... Ngh?! Natsume: Nh... My mouth's getting all sticky... Don't tell me you're leaking pre-cum already? Kousei: Y-Yeah... I don't know if I'm actually bigger than usual or not... Kousei: But I am incredibly aroused, I can tell you that much. Natsume: Are you gonna cum soon? Kousei: If I let my guard down, I just might. Natsume: *giggle*... Well, you'd better hold it in. I'm just getting started here. Nhhh... *lick* *lick*... Kousei: *gulp*... Kousei: Ngh! Kousei: You seem... eager. Natsume: Hmm? Do I? *lick*... *slurp* *slurp* *lick*... Kousei: The way you use your tongue... Kousei: Don't tell me you... actually want my cum? Do you... actually think it tastes good? Natsume: What? Please. How could something that smelly and sticky taste good? If anything, it's disgusting. Kousei: O-Oh. Natsume: How about I feed it to you mouth-to-mouth next time so you can see for yourself? Natsume: I never said that. Kousei: Huh? Natsume: It's smelly and goopy, and in a lot of ways, kind of gross. Natsume: But... I never said I hated it. *lick* *lick*... *slurp* *slurp*... *suck* Kousei: Ahh... Ngh... O-Oh. Kousei: In that case... please, keep going. Natsume: Nhh... *kiss* *kiss* *lick* *lick*... Kousei: Ahhh! You sure you've got that blindfold on properly? Natsume: Yeah, I think so... Why? Kousei: Because you're way too precise... Kousei: You shouldn't be able to do this if you can't see, right? Natsume: Of course I can. After all... how many times do you think I've been bullied by this dick of yours? Natsume: I've already memorized its shape... *lick* *lick*... *slurp* *slurp*... Kousei: Ngh, ah... *pant* *pant*... *pant*... Natsume: *giggle*... You're moaning so much. Does it feel that good? *slurp*... Nh... Natsume: Well, too bad... You can't cum yet. Not until I say so... Ahmph. Kousei: Ah, ahh! Natsume: *slurp*... Mhhh... Nhhh! Mhh, mngh... *slurp* *slurp* Kousei: Your mouth is so warm, Natsume... Ngh! Natsume: *slurp* *suck* *suck*... I'll warm you up even more... *slurp* *slurp* *slurp* Kousei: Ngh! Natsume: I don't need to see now that it's in my mouth, do I? Ngh, nhh... *suck* *suck*! Kousei: Still, though... Ngh... This feels even better than usual. Natsume: *slurp*... *slurp* *slurp*... Ahh! *pant*... *pant*... Natsume: Probably because you're turned on more than usual. Kousei: You're not giving me much of a choice! Natsume: You want to shoot out your thick, sticky loads, don't you? Ahmph... *slurp* *slurp* *suck* *suck* *suck*! Kousei: Ngh, ahh... If you suck that hard... Natsume: You can't cum yet, okay? Not yet... *suck*... *suck* *suck* *suck*! Kousei: Then please, slow down a little! Natsume: *giggle*... You're twitching so happily, though. But it doesn't matter how much you struggle... you're not getting away. Natsume: Nh... *suck* *suck* *slurp*... *suck* suck* *slurp*... Nghh! Kousei: Ahhhh! You're sucking so hard! Natsume: Nhh... Nhh *slurp*... *suck* *suck* *suck*... *slurp* *slurp* Kousei: Natsume, that... that feels amazing... And your expression too... It's so lewd... Natsume: *suck* *suck*... Nhhh... *lick* *lick* *lick*... Natsume: Shut up... You can't even see my face with this blindfold on... *slurp* *suck* Kousei: Even with the blindfold, I can tell how excited you're getting. Kousei: You're enjoying this, aren't you? Natsume: *suck* *suck*... *suck* *suck* *slurp*... Natsume: This lewd taste and smell... it's getting even thicker... Mghh... Nh, nhhh... Nhh! Kousei: Ahhhhh?! Kousei: Natsume, that... A-Ahh... If you suck me like that, I'm gonna--! Natsume: Nhh... Nh, nhh... *suck* *suck* *slurp* *slurp*! Kousei: Wait! Ahh! Kousei: You say that, but... Ahh, I can't! Natsume: *suck* *suck* Fine... You can cum. I want you to cum... Shoot out your hot, sticky stuff... *slurp*... Kousei: Ahh, Natsume! I'm gonna cum... I can't hold it anymore! Natsume: Mhhh? Nh... Nh... *suck*! Kousei: W-Wait, let go! If you don't let go I'm gonna--! Natsume: It's fine, do it... I'll swallow it for you again... Mhhhh *suck*! Kousei: You said it was... Ngh... Gross, didn't you? Don't... Ah... Force yourself... Natsume: I'm not... I'll swallow it... I wanna drink... your freshly-squeezed cum... Can't I? Kousei: N-Natsume! Kousei: A-Ahh! I'm gonna cum... I'm gonna cum, Natsume! Natsume: Nhhh, nghh... Ngh... Mhhh... *suck* *suck* *slurp*! Natsume: *slurp* *slurp* *suck* *suck* *suck*... *suck*! Kousei: Ahhhh! Nggghhhhhh! Natsume: Mhhh?! Hngh, nhh, nhhh... *pant* *pant*... Nh, nhhh... Natsume: Ngh... *gulp*... *gulp*... *gulp*... Kousei: Ngh! Natsume: Nghhhh... Ahh! *cough* *cough*! *pant* *pant* *pant*... Natsume: It's so thick... *cough* *cough*! I-I thought was going to die... choking to death on your cum... *pant* *pant*... Kousei: I want to mark you as mine. Natsume: Mhh? Nhh... Nhhh... Ahh! *pant* *pant*... *pant*... Natsume: Well, if you put it that way... Fine... *lick* *smack* *slurp*... *lick* *lick*... Kousei: Ah, right there... That's the spot... Natsume: *lick* *slurp*... *lick* *lick* *suck*... *slurp* *slurp* *smack* Kousei: Nhh... Ngghhhhh! Natsume: *gasp*?! Nhh, ngh, nhh! Ahhh! Nghhh! Natsume: Ahhh! *pant* *pant*... Kousei: Who wouldn't, after all that? *pant* *pant*... Natsume: You're all out of breath too... Here, let me clean you up... Mhh *lick* *lick*... *pant* *pant*... Natsume: Actually... it's kind of hard to clean you properly with the blindfold on. Can I take it off yet? Kousei: ...... Kousei: No, not yet. Natsume: What? Why not? Kousei: Because... I'm the only one who's been feeling good so far. Now it's my turn to return the favor--three times as much. Natsume: What are you--? Kousei: C'mon... Up you go. Natsume: Huh? A-Ahh, wait! Kousei: Here we--go! Natsume: Ahhh?! Kousei: ...... Natsume: What? Why aren't you saying anything? Stop it, you're making me nervous... Kousei: Your boobs are crazy soft... Natsume: Nhh, ah... W-Well... They are natural... Kousei: There is one spot... that's rather hard, though. Natsume: Ahh! Ah, ah... Nhh... Not my nipples... *pant*... Ahh... Nghh... Natsume: Why is it so thrilling... being touched like this? Kousei: I love you, Natsume... Natsume: Nh, nhh?! Don't whisper in my ear like that... You're making my heart race... *pant* *pant* *pant*... Kousei: You're even hornier than usual today. Natsume: That's because... the blindfold... It's getting me so excited... Kousei: Are you that eager to do it already? Kousei: You like it, don't you? Natsume: Ahh?! Nhh, nh, nhh... Hngh! Kousei: You're already so hot and wet down here. Natsume: Because... Ah, ahh, ngh... Ngh... *pant* Ahh... Ahhh! Natsume: Don't tease me like this... *pant*... *pant*... *pant*... *pant*... Kousei: You gotta let me recover. I just came a little while ago, you know... Kousei: *pant*... *pant*... I'm sorry, Natsume. Natsume: Huh? What are you--? Kousei: I can't hold back any longer. Natsume: Ahhh?! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh! Ngghhh! Kousei: I wanted to surprise you. The truth is, I wanted to keep teasing you some more... Kousei: But you just looked so sexy, I couldn't help myself. Kousei: Are you mad? Natsume: Ah, ahhh... Nh, nhh... I don't like it when you lie... but I'm not mad. Natsume: Ahhhhhhh... Your dick... is finally... *pant* *pant*... *pant*... Kousei: Does it really make things that different? Natsume: It feels like... my other senses are becoming more sensitive... since I can't see... Kousei: Ngh... That feels good. Kousei: The way your pussy wraps around me... Natsume: I can feel your dick so clearly... bucking around inside me... Ah! Ah, ah, ah, ahhhhh! Natsume: Nhh, ahh! It feels so good... I'm going crazy! Kousei: Me too... It's like I'm losing my mind. Natsume: You were already an idiot from the start, though... *pant* *pant* *pant*... Kousei: Oh, yeah? I'm gonna make you regret saying--that! Natsume: Nhh, eek?! Ah, agh... Ahh... Right there! Kousei: Here? Natsume: Ngh, ahh! Y-Yes... I love it when you pound me there! Natsume: Huh? In a bad way? Kousei: No way. It mind-blowing. Natsume: Ah, ah... Ah, ah, ah! If you grind that spot... I'm gonna melt! Natsume: If you keep grinding me there, my heads gonna meeelt! Natsume: Ahh! Ah, ahhhh... You're digging so deep... Nhh! Kousei: I love you... I love you, Natsume... I love you, I love you, I love you... Natsume: Ah, ah, ah! Don't whisper like that... It tickles! Natsume: But... it makes me so happy... It's making me feel even better... Ah, ahh, ahhhhhhh! Kousei: Your tits are so soft... and your moans are so lewd... I love how cute you are. Natsume: Ahhhhh... I'm so happy... Ah, ah, ahh... I love you... I love you too! Kousei: Natsume, Natsume! Natsume: Ah! Ah! Ah, ah, ah! That... That feels amaziiiinggg! Natsume: Nooo! I'm really gonna turn into a pervert... If you rub me there, I'm really gonna turn into a pervert! Kousei: *pant* *pant* *pant*... Natsume... Can I take off your blindfold? Natsume: Ahh, *pant*! Wuh? Wh-Why now? Kousei: Because you sound like you're losing your mind.

Natsume: I'm making a really naughty expression right now! Ah, ahh, ahh... You can't, you can't, you can't! Natsume: Nooo, don't looook... You idiot... Kousei: I love seeing you feeling so good... It's turning me so much. Kousei: Nothing wrong with that. Go crazy. Natsume: My body's going numb... I don't know what's happening anymore! Natsume: Ah, ahhhhhh... Don't look! Don't look at my face! Kousei: You look adorable, Natsume. I love you. Kousei: Your insides feel amazing too! Your pussy feels so good... way too good! Natsume: *pant* *pant* *pant* *pant*... I'm so happy... So happy! Kousei: Me too. I love you! I love you, Natsume! Natsume: M-Me too... I love you! This is pure bliss... Ah, ah, ah, ah! Natsume: I l-love you... I love having s-sex with you! Ah, ahhh! Kousei: Natsume... Natsume! Kousei: Natsume, me too! Natsume: Nhh! Cum! Cum inside me! Natsume: Ahh! Ahhhh! I'm cumming... I'm cumming, I'm cumming! Natsume: I'm cumminnngggggg! Natsume: Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Kousei: *pant*... *pant*... Kousei: N-Natsume, I'm gonna cum... I'm gonna cum! Natsume: Do it... H-Hurry... Ahhh... Hurry, hurry! Nghh! Natsume: Ngh, ahh! I'm c-cumming... I'm cumming... Ahhhhhh... I'm cumming! Natsume: Nggghhhhhhhhhh! Kousei: *pant*... *pant*... Natsume: You came... so much... Kousei: I can't move... Feels like my whole body's gone numb... *pant* *pant* *pant*... Natsume: Me too... This felt... way better than I expected... *pant* *pant* *pant*... Kousei: Yeah... I don't think I've ever been this sensitive before. Natsume: Blindfolds are... amazing... *pant*... *pant*... *pant*... Kousei: We should use it again sometime. Natsume: I'll have to think about it. Kousei: Aww. Why do you say that? Natsume: Because... it felt way too good. I was gonna go crazy. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Well, at any rate, you don't have any complaints about it being your White Day gift anymore, right? Natsume: I... guess not. Not anymore. Kousei: Thank goodness. "

Why does my stomach hurt so much? Kousei: (Wh-Whoa. You're not looking too good. Are you alright?) Kousei: ...... Kousei: I've already decided where we're going to go. Kousei: Just gotta make sure I don't miss my mark today. Natsume: Even if there are slip-ups, it'll be a successful date as long as you can laugh it off together. Natsume: Don't be scared. All you have to do is stay calm and talk to her like you normally do. Natsume: Most of all, don't focus on trying to make things \"special.\" That's not the important part, okay? Do you understand? Kousei: Make it fun. Make Akizuki-san smile while we're together. Kousei: *inhale*... *exhale*... *inhale*... *exhale*...  Kanna: Ah, good morning. Kousei: Morning. Kanna: You're right on time. Kousei: Not like I live that far away. Kousei: Anyway, you ready to go? Kanna: Already? If we're not in a hurry, I'd be happy to make you a cup of coffee or something first. Kousei: Hmm... Kousei: No, not today. If you're ready, let's get going. Kanna: Okay. Mikado: Alright. Take care. Kanna: So, where are we going? Kousei: What do you say we get something to eat first? Kousei: We might as well eat out while we're at it. Kanna: Sure, I don't mind... Kousei: There are all sorts of dishes out there we can't make at the cafe. Kousei: Speaking of which... Is there anything you want to eat? Kanna: Well, let me think... Hmm... I'm fine with anything, really. Kanna: Why are you stuttering? Kanna: I didn't say anything about pasta, did I? Kousei: No. I just thought that seemed like something a girl would like. Kousei: But I suppose we already serve pasta at the cafe. Kousei: Let's eat something else today. Kanna: Good point. Hmm... By the way, what do YOU usually eat for lunch, Takamine-san? Kousei: At school, I usually eat in the cafeteria. Kousei: But before I started working here, I'd just make myself something simple for lunch. Or I'd have ramen, if I happened to be out. Kanna: Ramen certainly is a popular choice. Is it that good? Kousei: Wait, don't tell me you've never had ramen? Kanna: I've had instant ramen, and ramen from Chinese restaurants, but I've never been to a proper Japanese ramen place. Kousei: Hmm... Kousei: Do you want to try going to one? Kanna: But you said you eat it all the time, didn't you? Shouldn't we pick something else? Kousei: I haven't had ramen since I started working at the cafe, actually. Kousei: Besides, after talking about it, I'm kinda craving some noodles now. Kanna: Alright then... We can go with ramen, if that's okay with you. Kousei: Sweet! Kousei: Still, I can't believe you've never had ramen before. Kanna: I've had a few chances to try it... but I've always been a little scared to go inside the restaurants. Kousei: You mean scared of going by yourself? Like with yakiniku places? Kanna: No, not that. What scares me is the thought of getting yelled at for breaking the rules. Kanna: You know how every ramen restaurant has their own house rules, right? Kanna: Some places don't allow you to make phone calls, or whisper, or even eat too slowly! Kanna: If I accidentally broke a rule, all the other customers would get up and shout \"Guilty!\" before beating me to a pulp, wouldn't they? Kanna: Really? Kousei: Yes, really. Kanna: What about that mysterious chant that goes \"noodlesfirmspicydoubleveggyextraextragarlicoil\"? Is that a joke too? Kousei: Er, no. That one's actually real... Kanna: What about being kicked out for not drinking the broth first? Or for drinking the broth, but stirring it with my chopsticks? Or for looking around while I eat? Kousei: Uhh... Kanna: What about that story about the guy who ate the mustard greens??? Kanna: Was that just a joke too? Kousei: How do you even KNOW about that old ramen copypasta?! Kousei: Have you and Mikado actually been to that ramen place or something? Kanna: No, Mikado-san can't handle hot foods. He's got what they call a cat's tongue, after all. Kousei: Well, that makes total sense, seeing as he IS a cat. Kousei: Just don't be too loud and show some common courtesy and you'll be fine. Ramen Shop Keeper: Welcome! Kousei: Ordering's easy. You just put in what you want at the machine here, and it gives you a ticket. Kanna: What do you recommend I get? Kousei: Hmm, let's see. I guess something light like shoyu or shio ramen would be easier for a girl to eat. Kanna: In that case, I'll have a shoyu ramen. Kousei: I'll go with the shoyu too. Kanna: *gasp*! Noodlesfirm-- Kousei: Shh! Stop that! Kousei: They don't do that kind of thing here! Seriously, they're going to think you're screwing with them! Kanna: M-My mistake. I'd better be careful... Phew... Kanna: Where's the plate of mustard greens I'm not supposed to eat? Kousei: They don't have that here either. Kousei: Relax. You don't need to know anything about ramen to eat here. All you have to do is enjoy your food. Kanna: I don't? Thank goodness. To tell you the truth, I'm quite excited. Kousei: No need to be nervous. Go ahead and savor every bite. Kanna: I plan to... Nihihi. Kousei: ...... Kanna: It's here! Thank you very much! Kanna: Would they get mad at me if I took a picture? Kousei: Nah, go ahead. I'd recommend eating it while it's still hot, though. Kanna: Oh, I know. It would defeat the whole purpose of coming here if I didn't eat while it was nice and hot. Kanna: But one photo can't hurt. Just for the memories. Kanna: Ooh, that came out great! Nice! Kanna: Now then, time to dig in. Kousei: Yep. Kanna: Umm... There's no correct order of eating, is there? Kousei: Nope. Eat however you'd like. Kanna: Okay! *blow* *blow*... *slurp*... Mhh! *sluuurp*! Kanna: *slurp*! Mhhhhhh! Kousei: Glad you liked it. Kanna: Nothing feels better than a full belly after a delicious meal! Today was a wonderful day. Kousei: Hey, the day's just getting started.. All we did was eat lunch. Kanna: Oh, that's right! You said you wanted me to go with you somewhere, didn't you? Kanna: Where exactly would that be? Kousei: I want you to go to an amusement park with me. Kanna: No, not necessarily... Kousei: Hm? Kanna: But there certainly seems to be a lot of men and women here together. Is that because... Kanna: All these couples are boyfriends and girlfriends... on Christmas dates? Kousei: Probably. It is the holiday season, after all. Kanna: Oh... I thought so. Kanna: No, this is my first time. What about you? Kousei: I've been a few times. Once or twice with Nozomi... and once for a field trip, a long time ago. Kousei: But this is the first time since I was a kid that I've gone alone with someone. Kanna: ...... Kousei: Alright. Let's go, shall we? Kanna: Huh?! O-Oh, right. O-Of course. That's why we're here. Kousei: Let's just walk around for now. If we see a ride that looks interesting, we can check it out. Kanna: Th-That was terrifying... No wonder they're called thrill rides. I never imagined it would be that steep... Kanna: How do people enjoy themselves on those? For a second there, I thought I caught a glimpse of the afterlife. Kousei: That doesn't sound like a joke, coming from you. Kanna: Urk... My heartbeat shoots up just from remembering how fast we were falling. Kousei: It's probably because you're not used to it. Maybe you'll enjoy it more if you experience it a few more times. Kousei: Wanna try the loop coaster next? Kanna: Twice in a row is too much for me. I might really wet myself. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Wanna try the loop coaster next? Kanna: Were you even listening to what I said? Kousei: I'm kidding, I'm kidding. Kanna: It sure didn't sound like that to me. The look in your eyes clearly said \"That is my fetish.\" Kousei: It most certainly is not. Also, please don't say that in public! People are staring! Kanna: That was the only way I could get you to stop. I really can't stand going on another ride. Kousei: Hmm... Kousei: How about a haunted house then? Kanna: You really ARE trying to make me wet myself, aren't you? Kanna: Sorry to disappoint you, but I'm immune to scary stuff. I'm well aware that there are no such things as ghosts and zombies. I AM a Grim Reaper, after all. Kousei: Good point. Kousei: But everybody knows haunted houses are fake. They're still scary despite that. Kanna: There's no way it could scare me if I knew it wasn't real. Kousei: Oh, really? Why don't we put that to the test then? Looks like there's no line either. Kanna: Let's do this. Kanna: Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh! Kanna: Wh-What WAS that?! That was just cheap! Kousei: Well, well. Where'd all that bravado from earlier go? Kanna: It wasn't the ghosts or zombies that got me, it was those jumpscares! That's cheating! Kousei: Yeah, I guess it's not really the same thing as actual fear. Kanna: Had I known that was their plan, I would've prepared myself accordingly... Kanna: N-N-N-N-No, of course not! Kousei: Then why are you stuttering so much? Kanna: I really didn't wet my pants, I swear! But... it was a bit of a close call. In fact, I'm having a rather hard time holding it in right now. Kousei: Is THAT why you're shaking so much?! We gotta get you to a bathroom pronto then! Kanna: W-Wait! Please, slow down! I really am about to-- Kanna: Ah. Kousei: Akizuki-san?! Kanna: Fooled you, didn't I? I haven't wet myself just yet... Kousei: Was that really necessary?! Kousei: Anyway, the women's restroom is just over there... but there seems to be a line. Can you hold it in? Kanna: I-I'll twy my bwest... Kousei: There's going to be a Christmas parade here later tonight. I guess these people are staking out spots so they can get a better view. Kanna: A parade? In that case, this might be our chance to ride some of the more popular attractions. Kousei: Is there anything in particular you've been dying to ride? Kanna: I wouldn't say I've been dying to ride it, but I would like to try the Ferris wheel. Kanna: Good idea. Let's get in line while we can. "

            "Kanna: I suppose the most important thing is to grind at a slow, constant speed. Though that's more difficult than you'd think. Kanna: I prefer to use a bit less force, but it's really a matter of personal preference. Kanna: There we go. Now that the beans are ground but not too powdery, it's time to measure out the proper amount, then place it into the dripper. Kanna: Next, you want to use some of your hot water to warm up the cup, before pouring the rest into the drip pot, and letting it cool down slightly. Kanna: To be honest, my brewing process hasn't changed all that much from the start. Kousei: But you said it tastes better, didn't you? Kanna: Strange, isn't it? Maybe it's because my pour-over technique has gotten better, now that I have more experience making coffee. Kanna: Alright. Here you are. Kousei: Tha... nks? Kousei: ...... Kousei: O-Oh, really now? Kousei: Oh, er... yeah. I guess I'll try it now. Kanna: By all means. Kousei: *slurp* Kanna: How is it? Kousei: Mhh, it's delicious. It smells amazing, and it's not too bitter either. Kanna: You like it? Oh, thank goodness! Kanna: What did I tell you? It makes a big difference to work the beans gently, adjusting the amount of water needed depending on the bloom. Kousei: R-Right. The beans. It's cute how they bloom and get all swollen. Kanna: What is this about? Kousei: Nevermind. Anyway, it's good. Kanna: Can you taste the flavor of the beans? Kousei: Oh, for sure. The beans are definitely--ahem--very noticeable. Kanna: Umm, is everything alright? Kanna: You've been acting a little strange ever since... Ah! Does my coffee not actually taste good?! Kousei: No, it does. It definitely tastes... great. Kanna: You say that, but it sounded like you had to think about it for a second there. Kanna: If there's something you'd like to tell me, please don't feel shy. Kousei: Err, I kind of can't! Kanna: Don't worry. I can take criticism. Kanna: If there's something wrong with my coffee, you need to be frank with me. The future of the cafe may depend on it. Kousei: ...... Kanna: Y-Yes? Kousei: Coffee beans aside--do you really need to show off your chest beans too?! Kanna: My chest beans? Kanna: Hmm... Kanna: Hmm. Kanna: Ah... Kanna: Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?! Kousei: I mean, I don't want to tell you how to live your life, but do remember, we ARE in the customer service industry. Kousei: That, and umm, I am a guy. Honestly, this is a little awkward for me. Kanna: I-It's not what it looks like! I have a bra on, I swear! Kousei: Then what are those, nipple enhancers?! Kanna: Of course not! Kanna: I'm not trying to look sexy! These are COFFEE beans! Kousei: Exactly where both your nipples are?! What kind of a miracle is that?! Kanna: I know it sounds ridiculous, but it's true! Kanna: I know you're thinking, Takamine-san, but they're coffee beans! Ah! Kanna: But that's not some kind of euphemism, okay?! My nipples are NOT like two dark roasts! Kousei: The thought never even crossed my mind! Kanna: It's not what it looks like! This is all one big misunderstanding! Look! Kousei: Ack?! Kousei: Umm, I can see that. Kanna: I obviously knew a few beans had slipped under my clothes, okay? But since I told you I'd change later, I... I had no idea-- Kanna: I had no idea it looked like my nipples were hard! Kanna: Please don't get the wrong idea! First of all, my nipples aren't even that dark! They're just the right shade of pink! Kousei: I never asked for that information! And why does that even matter?! Kanna: Well, because if I had nipples as dark as coffee beans, you'd... think I play with them all the time! My pure, innocent image would be tarnished! Kousei: And flashing me your cleavage like this doesn't?! Kanna: Okay, so they both do! But I don't want to mislead you into thinking I always p-play with my nipples or anything! Kousei: This entire SITUATION has been misleading from the start! Suzune: What are you guys yelling out here for? Natsume: Did something happen? Mei: Senpaaai! The girls are done changing now! Nozomi: You'd better hurry up and get changed too. Natsume & Nozomi & Mei & Suzune: Ah. Kanna & Kousei: Ah... Mei: What's going on here?! Suzune: Well, well, well. Looks like we stumbled upon something we shouldn't have. Nozomi: Wh-Wha... Wha--?! Y-You and Kanna-san... were in this kind of r-relationship all along?! Natsume: Did you, um, finally decide to take his virginity? Should we leave you two alone? Kanna: I'm not doing anything of the sort! Stop being inappropriate! Natsume: I think you're much more guilty of that than I am. Kanna: You don't understand! I'm merely doing this to protect my pure, innocent image! Mei: By exposing your boobs in a public place?! Wh-What kind of purity is that?! Kanna: I'm not exposing them! Suzune: Then what exactly are you doing? Kanna: Researching optimal coffee flavor! Suzune: By warming coffee beans with your tits? Natsume: Is that supposed to be innovative or something? Nozomi: Kind of like Kopi Luwak? Suzune: More like Titty Luwak, honestly. Actually, on second thought, that's a pretty crappy name. Natsume: I mean, doesn't the Kopi in Kopi Luwak mean \"coffee\"? Nozomi: What are we even talking about now? Suzune: A new kind of coffee that sad, gullible men would pay for. Natsume: If I recall, a single cup of Kopi Luwak can cost upwards of a few thousand yen. At more expensive places, it might even go as high as 8,000 yen. Nozomi: I heard it was expensive, but holy cow! Suzune: You could even charge customers an extra fee to let them choose whose tits warm their beans. Suzune: Though obviously, MY tits aren't anywhere near big enough for the job. Ahahahaha... *sigh*... Suzune: You were all waiting for the punchline about my lack of tits, weren't you? Yeah, yeah. Very original. Haven't heard that one before. Suzune: Anyone who even THINKS about ordering a drink like that should just drop dead... Natsume: Why'd you bring it up in the first place then? Suzune: That's sexual harassment, you know?! I'll take you to court! Kousei: Me?! You're the one who started this conversation! Mei: Nozomi-chan. What's a \"Kopi Luwak\"? Some kind of secret menu item? What kind of kinky service do you get for 8,000 yen? Nozomi: It's just a regular menu item, actually. It's a type of coffee made using beans taken from the droppings of a palm civet. Mei: Scat coffee?! Eek! You're disgusting, Senpai! Kousei: Hold on! I never said anything of the sort! I'm definitely NOT into that! Natsume: Doesn't sound very convincing to me. Kousei: All I wanted was a cup of coffee, but it blew up into a giant fiasco. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Cleavage... Kousei: Argh! Snap out of it! If I keep having these thoughts, I won't be able to look Akizuki-san in the eye tomorrow! Kousei: I need to think about something else--like the menu! Kousei: Yeah, a new menu item... Come to think of it, a coffee made from breast-ly warmed beans... might actually sell pretty well among certain customers. Kousei: Who knows? Maybe her boobs really DID impart some flavor into... No, stop it, Kousei! Stop thinking about boobs! Kousei: The others would never talk to me again if I suggested the idea for real. Kousei: But then again... I could be on to something. Kousei: Nhh... Nghh! Kousei: Alright. Gotta wash my face, have breakfast, then head to work. Kousei: Hey. Kanna: Umm, I'm sorry about yesterday. I shouldn't have lost my composure like that... Kanna: But don't get me wrong! I just wanted to prove that they were coffee beans. Kousei: Yeah, I know. Kousei: But I'll be honest, I'm still unclear on how proving the color of your nipples is supposed to protect your pure, innocent image. Kanna: Isn't there a big difference between dark and pink nipples?! Kousei: Well, some people say they get darker the more you touch them... But some people are just born with them that color. Kanna: I guess that's true. Kousei: Anyway, this probably isn't a conversation we should be having first thing in the morning. Kanna: Y-Yeah. But let me apologize for yesterday once last time. Kousei: It's all good. Kousei: And for the record, I really did think your coffee was delicious. Kousei: I'd love to have some again sometime. Kanna: It'd be my pleasure! Kanna: Ah--but I'm not going to use my breasts to warm up your beans this time, got that? Kousei: ...... Kanna: Why aren't you saying anything?! You're making it seem like you were actually hoping I would! Kousei: I mean, I know it couldn't possibly affect the taste of the coffee... but I do kinda wanna try it. Kanna: ...... Kousei: Come on. Why aren't you saying anything? You're making it seem like you actually think I'm a creep or something. Kanna: I hate to break it to you, but that WAS in fact a very creepy thing to say. Kousei: Hold on. I didn't mean it in a creepy way. Kousei: I'm just saying I'd try it if the opportunity presented itself to me. Purely out of curiosity. Kanna: Anyway, I'd be happy to make you a coffee anytime. Suzune: Looks like things have calmed down a bit. Kousei: Yeah. Suzune: Why don't you take a little breather while you have the chance? Kousei: As much as I'd like to--there's a new dish I want to try my hand at making first. Suzune: Oh? Finally came up with something, huh? Kousei: It's not exactly an original dish, though. Kousei: Anyway, I'd like to get your opinion on-- Kousei: Oh, Hiuchidani-san! Mei: Eep?! Kousei: You don't have to act so frightened of me... Mei: S-Sorry. I know it was all a misunderstanding yesterday, but still... Kousei: Well, whatever. You haven't had lunch yet, have you? Kousei: There's actually a new dish I want you to try. Mei: A new secret menu item?! Kousei: It's not secret!  Kousei: There's nothing shady about it, okay? It'll be a regular menu item! Kousei: Anyway, I'm going to cook it now, so I'd like you to try some. And it's nothing weird, I promise! Mei: W-Well, okay. Kousei: Omelette alla carbonara... Or a carbonara topped with egg, alternatively. Mei: Oh-ho. Suzune: Huh. It's a simple dish, but people who like it can't get enough of it. Suzune: And we already have all the ingredients, so we can add it to the menu whenever we want. Kousei: See? I told you it wasn't anything weird. Suzune: I watched him cook it too, so you don't have to worry. Mei: Alright then. Let's try this. Mei: Ah... Ahmph... Ah, this is pretty good. Kousei: Really? Mei: Yeah. It's good--but, uh... Kousei: But what? Mei: To be honest, it really does just taste like carbonara topped with an egg. Suzune: Let me try some. Ahmph. Suzune: Hmm. I have to agree. Since you wrapped it in an egg, it might be a good idea to use a different sauce than the regular carbonara. Kousei: I guess it feels a bit too cheap, huh? Mei: But it really does taste good. I wasn't lying. Suzune: Yeah, it's not bad, per se. I'm just saying you could improve it with the sauce. Mei: Senpai, you said I could have this for my lunch, right? Kousei: Yeah. Mei: Great! Then don't mind if I do! Kousei: Go ahead. Mei: Thank you very much! Kousei: ...... Kousei: Thanks. I'll keep working on the sauce. Kousei: I'm open to any other advice you have for me. Suzune: I know. Suzune: But really, there's not much I can say. You'll have to figure it out through trial and error. Kousei: I'll try my best. Suzune: Yeah, I know. Just keep at it. Kousei: I will. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Well, whatever. Kousei: The last time I did something like this... was ages ago. Kousei: Back when Mom was still alive. "

Next thing you know, people will be asking me about quantum physics or something...",

            "Kousei: ...... Kousei: Don't call them just for laughs. I'm sure they're busy. Kousei: Look, I'm not having weird thoughts or anything. I'm just nervous, that's all. Kousei: There's just something strange about seeing you in my room. Natsume: Well, I guess I don't blame you. I'm a little nervous too. Kousei: You are? Natsume: I keep telling myself there's nothing to be anxious about, but this is the first time I've ever been to a guy's apartment too. Natsume: O-Oh! A kotatsu. Nothing beats a kotatsu in the winter, huh? But I have to say, your place is a lot cleaner than I thought it'd be. Kousei: Well, you know. Natsume: I bet Sumizome-san's the one who does most of the cleaning, though. Am I right? Kousei: She used to, but these days, I do it all myself. Kousei: Since she always used to keep everything clean for me, I can't stand leaving things messy now. Kousei: And letting junk pile up just means more work when you have to clean it up later. If I have to spend my days off doing housework, it ends up feeling like I've wasted the day away. Natsume: No wonder you didn't seem fazed when I suddenly asked if I could come over. Natsume: By the way, where do you keep your spices and seasonings? You don't mind if I poke around, do you? Kousei: Most of the stuff I have is in the fridge, or under the sink. Natsume: It's nothing special, so keep your expectations low. Kousei: I don't buy it. This has to be delicious. Kousei: Mhh! This is great! Your ginger-fried pork is something else! So delicious! Natsume: That's laying it on a bit thick. Kousei: No, seriously. I know you told me not to expect much, but this honestly tastes amazing. Natsume: Does it? Well, um, I'm glad you like it. Kousei: Ah, I know. It's a bit sweeter. Kousei: Did you use sugar when making the sauce? Natsume: Nrgh... Natsume: Yes, I did, but it's not because I'm bad with ginger, okay? It's not THAT bitter. Kousei: I know. I wasn't saying it's too sweet. Kousei: In fact, it's just right. You're pretty good at cooking. Natsume: I only cook well enough for myself. I don't know if I'd say I'm \"good\" at it. Kousei: Maybe, but it's far from bad. I'd say your taste for seasoning is pretty sharp. Kousei: Well, except for that time you basically drank a cup of coffee-flavored sugar. Natsume: Tch. Shuddup, will you? Coffee's not the same. You all are the weird ones for being able to drink something that bitter. Kousei: Maybe, but I don't think that much sugar is good for you. Not that you drink it every day, but still. Natsume: Well, thanks for your concern. Kousei: But anyway, this is delicious. Makes me want to try your curry or your Hamburg steak too. Natsume: Now who's got childish tastes? Kousei: I don't wanna hear that from someone who can't eat green peppers. Natsume: Nrghhh... Kousei: I really do want to try your other stuff, though. Natsume: Well, maybe some other time. Natsume: Well, in that case, takoyaki and yakisoba are the simplest things that come to mind. Kousei: Baby castella cakes are pretty easy to make too. Natsume: Simple enough for an amateur to make? Kousei: I mean, probably. With a bit of practice, at least. Natsume: Oh! I almost forgot about the most important thing. Natsume: We also need to think about what our customers would want, and who we're trying to target. People of all ages and genders come to visit the shrine on New Year's, after all. Kousei: That's why stuff like takoyaki is so popular. It's hard to resist the urge when you see them. They're a street stall staple. Natsume: Hmm... But there's no reason we can't compete by selling other staples, is there? Natsume: Festival staples, New Year's staples, winter staples... Kousei: You mean like osechi, or mochi? Natsume: Speaking of winter... For me, it's got to be the kotatsu. Natsume: *sigh*... So warm and toasty. Kousei: Want some tangerines? Natsume: Oh, sure. Kousei: Here. Natsume: Thanks. Nothing says Japanese winter like a kotatsu and tangerines. Kousei: Now that you mention it, we should probably sell something that'll warm people up. Natsume: Something warm... Like hot pot? Or oden, or maybe miso soup, or pork soup. Kousei: It needs to be something people can eat while walking, though. Kousei: Hmm. What about roasted sweet potatoes? Natsume: Maybe Suzune-san could use them to make some kind of cake, like for a January special? No, but then we might not have enough potatoes... Kousei: Plus the variety of potato we use for roasting might not be the best for making sweets, either. Kousei: Hmm. I always see it in the hot foods section at the convenience store, yeah. Kousei: But speaking of convenience store food--what about Chinese meat buns? "
