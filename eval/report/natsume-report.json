            "Kousei: It's good, but it really is just a normal restaurant. Natsume: That's fine. All I care about is whether or not the food tastes good. And besides, I'm just as lazy as you, so I haven't had anything deep-fried in a while either. Kousei: You said you live alone, right? Natsume: Yeah. My parents' house isn't that far, though. About twenty minutes by train. Kousei: Couldn't you commute to school from home then? Natsume: I just prefer living alone. It's more convenient for me that way. Kousei: Err, nothing. Natsume: Well, then pick up the pace. I'm starving. Natsume: Phew. That was great. It's been a while since I've had fried food. Kousei: Glad you liked it. Kousei: Honestly, though, I couldn't stop worrying that it was some sort of test. Natsume: Don't start that again. I told you: all I care about is whether or not I can enjoy myself and eat good food. Kousei: Yeah, I guess. Natsume: I do, at least. But it mostly depends on the person and the occasion. Kousei: What do you mean by the occasion? Natsume: Even girls who usually don't care about fancy restaurants want to eat somewhere special on special days. Kousei: Like Christmas, for example? Natsume: Or birthdays, or anniversaries. On those occasions, most people want to celebrate with something different than usual, don't you think? Kousei: Yeah. I guess I feel that way too sometimes. Kousei: What about you, Shiki-san? Do the holidays get you in the mood to eat somewhere fancy? Natsume: Me? Hmm. Not really. I've never been good with big crowds to begin with. Natsume: I probably wouldn't even want to go out on Christmas anyway. Kousei: Gotcha. Natsume: Well... I did get a few invitations, but since I don't like crowds, and I didn't want to get their hopes up, I turned them all down. Kousei: Alone with a girl on Christmas... Yeah, I can see how a guy might misinterpret that. Kousei: Have you always hated Christmas, though? Didn't you celebrate it when you were a kid? Natsume: I don't hate Christmas itself, per se. I just hate crowds of people. Natsume: I'm pretty sure I got excited for it when I was little. I got to have play dates with my friends over winter break, after all. Kousei: Your friends? Natsume: What? You think I never had any friends? Kousei: I never said that. Natsume: For Christmas, we'd have a takoyaki party. Those were all the rage back in the day. We were supposed to exchange presents, have a sleepover, you know. Kousei: \"Supposed to\"? Natsume: The day of, I suddenly fell ill and had to go to the hospital. I ended up spending New Year's in the bed there. Kousei: Oh, right. That's why your parents couldn't open the cafe, isn't it? Natsume: No, that's a different story. Natsume: Anyway, I couldn't attend the party. And ever since then, I haven't been to another one. Natsume: Actually, speaking of Christmas--how are the Yule Logs coming along? Kousei: They're great. I got the chance to try one the other day. Natsume: Should I help? I imagine it's going to take more effort than usual. Kousei: You'll have to ask Suzune-san about that. Kousei: I'm helping with them too, but she's ultimately the only one who knows how to do the finishing touches. Natsume: Like the pattern of the tree bark and stuff? Kousei: Yeah. I've been practicing a bit myself, but it's hard to get mine to the same level of quality as hers. Kousei: It'd probably take me more than a hundred tries to get it right. Kousei: But yeah, I think Suzune-san would be grateful for the extra help. It'd let her focus on perfecting them. Kousei: Don't you already have your hands full on the dining floor, though? The more preorders we get, the busier things are bound to get on your end. Natsume: We're all going to be busy. Besides, it'll be winter break, so we won't have classes to worry about. Natsume: We should probably get together with Suzune-san to discuss our holiday shifts. Maybe tomorrow... Kousei: Yeah. Either way, we'll have to wait and see what the boss says. Natsume: But man, I can't believe it's already Christmas... Then the week after that is New Year's. Kousei: What are you doing for New Year's? Going to visit your parents? Natsume: I live close enough that I could come back that day, if I wanted to. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Speaking of which, the cafe's been doing pretty well lately, hasn't it? Natsume: Huh? Yeah, I suppose. Why do you ask? Kousei: Have you, err, thought about inviting your parents to come see the place? Natsume: ...... Natsume: Well, we've only been in business for a few months. Once things settle down a bit... I'll ask them when I get the chance. Kousei: Alright. Sorry if that question was a little too personal. Natsume: It's fine. Kousei: Changing the subject--I bet a lot of guys have asked you out for New Year's too, right? To go shrine-visiting or whatever. Natsume: Yeah, but I turned them all down too. Kousei: It ain't easy being popular, huh? Feels like you're only going to get more invitations as the holidays get closer too. Natsume: *sigh*... I can use work as a reason to turn down Christmas invitations, but I don't have any good excuses for New Year's. You got any ideas? Kousei: Can't you just say you're visiting your parents? Natsume: They don't live far, though. If some guy decides to pester me about where their house is, it'd only make things more complicated. Natsume: A flimsy lie like that falls apart really quickly under pressure. Trust me, it won't end well. Kousei: Sounds like you're speaking from experience. Natsume: I'll spare you the details, but it wasn't pretty... Tch. Natsume: You think I should get another job? Kousei: If you want, I can get you work as a shrine maiden. Natsume: Urgh... Kousei: Don't give me that look! I'm not saying I'll pay you to cosplay for me! Kousei: You've heard of the Akaiwa Shrine, haven't you? It's local. The place is actually managed by Nozomi's family. Natsume: Sumizome-san's family? Ahh, now that you mention it... Kousei: They look for temporary shrine maidens every year for New Year's. I'm sure they'd be happy to hire you. Kousei: That way, you can easily turn down anyone who asks you out, just as long as you don't go into detail on what you're doing. Natsume: Hmm... If it's for Sumizome-san's family, it's probably nothing weird, I guess. Natsume: It sounds a little embarrassing, though. But I am also a bit interested. Kousei: Oh, really? That's surprising. Kousei: Don't tell me you're actually a cosplay enthusiast yourself, Shiki-san? Natsume: No. I'm not like you. Kousei: Not sure why you're treating that as fact. I've never once said I have a thing for cosplay, you know? Natsume: Yeah, you said it \"wasn't bad.\" Kousei: I'm afraid I don't recall. Natsume: Seriously? I also recall you saying you liked married women. Kousei: Like hell I did! That was YOU who said both of those things! Natsume: See? You do remember, you little liar. Kousei: ...... Natsume: Maybe a little. That one might've been too strong for me. Excuse me! Could I get a glass of water? Bartender: Yes, ma'am. Natsume: Phew... I guess I'm a bit tipsy. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Err, you totally are. Kousei: You're gonna end up regretting it tomorrow, I guarantee. Natsume: You think so? Maybe I will. Whatever. Natsume: Still, I might be interested in that shrine maiden gig... and not just because I'm drunk. Kousei: Oh, yeah? Should I go ahead and let Nozomi know? Natsume: Sure, why not? Natsume: I'm not completely sure it's for me, but I'll probably never get an opportunity to experience something like this again. Kousei: Don't worry. In terms of skimpiness, miko outfits are pretty modest. Kousei: I'll talk to Nozomi about it later. Natsume: Thanks. Kousei: Anyway, we should probably head home soon. Natsume: We're leaving already? Kousei: ...... Natsume: Just kidding. Kousei: Well, just so you know: you better not blame me for your hangover tomorrow. Natsume: Hmm? That's okay. I drank because I wanted to. Natsume: And I made you help me out with something before we went to the bar, so I have no complaints. Kousei: Well, I don't think I was much help with that. Natsume: It's fine. I knew it was a silly idea in the first place. Kousei: Hey, you're actively thinking of ways to improve the place. That's a good thing. Kousei: Suzune-san told me something similar too. Kousei: Whether or not I'll actually BE any help is a separate matter, though. Natsume: You know, you should really stop with all the self-deprecation. Kousei: It's just kind of a habit I've developed over the years. Kousei: But maybe if I get a couple piercings like you, that'll change things for me? Natsume: Hmm, I don't know. I won't stop you if you want to, though. Natsume: I know they say getting your ears pierced changes your luck, but nothing's changed for me, as far as I can tell. Kousei: Is that why you got yours pierced? Natsume: Agh... I'm definitely drunk. Natsume: Good luck. If you can manage to fix that pessimism of yours, you might actually be able to become a ladies' man in the future. Kousei: Whoa. Careful. Natsume: Yeah... Sorry. Kousei: Want to sit down? I can go buy you some water. Natsume: Ngh... I'm fine. We're almost there anyway. Can I hold onto you, though? Natsume: Yeah. I won't throw up. But I'd appreciate it if you could help me walk the rest of the distance back to my place. Kousei: Well, if you say so. Kousei: It's to the left up here, right? Natsume: No. Straight ahead. Natsume: What, are you pretending to get lost so you can take me to a hotel? Help, officer! Kousei: Keep your voice down! I wasn't pretending, okay? I genuinely forgot where you live! Kousei: And for the record, I don't have the guts to pull something like that anyway! Natsume: I know. The way you're acting all flustered is proof enough of that. Kousei: Then stop shouting for help, please! You're gonna give me a heart attack! "

Kousei: Right, the photogeneric... er, photogenic stuff. Kousei: Do you get a lot of likes? Nozomi: I don't really keep count... but sometimes I do. Especially when it looks super mouth-watering, or when it's from a famous restaurant. Not just from my friends, either; strangers like my posts too. Kousei: Oh, okay. That's good to know.

Kousei: Wait a minute. I thought that was ice cream on mine? Nozomi: That's butter. It's got a bit of saltiness to it that should help cleanse your palate.

            "Suzune: Yep. I told you before when the topic of Christmas came up, remember? I suggested we go with a classic Yule Log. Suzune: Anyway, I went ahead and whipped up a prototype. Suzune: After all, we gotta have some pictures to accompany the announcement. Kousei: Okay, I get that. But why did you want to come up to my room again? Suzune: Do I... really have to say it? Kousei: Let me guess: you can't finish eating it yourself. Suzune: Ding, ding, ding! Correct. Kousei: Man, why'd you have to make it sound so suggestive? You led me on there. Suzune: Aww, did I get your heart racing? Kousei: Well, maybe a little. Suzune: Perfect. That's what you get for teasing me that one time! Hehehe. Kousei: You still haven't gotten over that? Suzune: Well, it's true that I can't finish this all by myself. Also, I wanted to hear your impressions. So go ahead, dig in! Kousei: I already know it's delicious just by the fact that you made it, Suzune-san. Suzune: Well, duh. I wanted to have you try it, so I obviously made sure it was up to scratch first. Suzune: But still, getting that validation of someone eating it and saying they like it is always good. Suzune: Those compliments are what give me the confidence to keep going. You know what I mean? Kousei: Yeah. Suzune: Be my guest. Suzune: Yep. A bit of sour goes a long way in bringing out the sweet, don't you think? Kousei: Yeah. Mhh. It tastes great. Suzune: Glad to hear it. Ehehe. Suzune: I'm also thinking about offering a couple variations, like ones with powdered sugar to powdered cocoa or powdered coffee. Kousei: Think you'll have enough time for all that? Suzune: It'll be a lot of work, but it shouldn't be impossible. As long as people place their orders ahead of time. But yeah, it'll be a real pain in the ass... Kousei: Well, if you can manage it, I think it's a good idea. The more variety, the better. Suzune: Thanks. Suzune: *gulp* *gulp*... Ahhh! Nothin' like a cold beer after a big success! No, sir! Kousei: C'mon, don't just sit there and drink. Help me eat this. Kousei: There's no way in hell I'm finishing this on my own. Suzune: I know. Suzune: Oh-ho. That look on your face tells me you're having dirty thoughts. You naughty boy, you. Kousei: A young man and woman. Alone together. In a locked room. There's only one thing that happens in a situation like this... Suzune: I'm gonna have to stop you right there. Suzune: If I don't make it back to my apartment, I'll leak your most embarrassing secrets to the whole wide world. Kousei: Relax, I'm kidding. I'd never try something like that. Suzune: Whaddaya mean \"never\"? You sayin' I ain't good enough for you, punk? Kousei: Of course I didn't mean it in an offensive way. I'm nothing if not a gentleman. Suzune: Oh, are you now? Kousei: For a gentleman like myself, a woman's attractiveness isn't determined solely by the size of her breasts! Suzune: You ARE makin' fun of me, you little shit! Suzune: Fine. As punishment, I'm going to figure out your preferences in women. Suzune: Guys all hide their porn mags underneath their beds, don't they? Kousei: No, they don't. And I don't even have any porn mags. Suzune: You liar. All guys your age have at least one or two. Kousei: Nobody buys physical porn these days. As long as you have a phone, you can find whatever you need, whenever. Suzune: Oh, uh-huh. Welp, time to search through your phone! Kousei: Yeah, right. That's not happening. Suzune: So you ARE hiding embarrassing stuff on there. Gimme your hand. I need your fingerprint to unlock it. Kousei: Hey! Haven't you heard of this thing called privacy?! Kousei: Nuh-uh! Kousei: Oof... Suzune: So, um, listen. Kousei: Yes?! Suzune: Sorry. Suzune: I got a little carried away. You were right; I don't have any right to ask you to show me your phone. Kousei: It's fine. Not like you actually saw anything. Kousei: Anyway, you're not hurt, are you? The cafe'd be in hot water if you twisted your hand or something. Suzune: I'm fine. We fell on the bed, so my whole body was pretty much cushioned. Kousei: That's great. Suzune: You good too? Kousei: Yeah, I'm fine. Suzune: Great. Kousei: ...... Suzune: So, um, are you ready to get off me? Kousei: O-Oh, yeah. Sorry. Suzune: ...... Suzune: I did what I came here to do, and I have to wake up early tomorrow too. Kousei: Yeah. Another day of work. Suzune: You'd better get to sleep soon too. I won't accept any excuses if you're late. Kousei: Yeah, I know. I won't be. Suzune: Alright, see you tomorrow. Kousei: See you tomorrow. Good night. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Phew... I really wasn't expecting THAT to happen. Kousei: My heart's still pounding like crazy. She's gone and all, but it still won't settle down. Kousei: Despite what her appearance would have you think, she's definitely an adult. Though if she heard me say that, she'd probably tear my head off. Kousei: Welp, I'd better go take a bath now. Suzune: *sigh*... Suzune: Urk... Suzune: Ahhhhh... Th-That scared the LIFE out of me... Suzune: I got way too carried away just now. I nearly gave away my first kiss by accident! Suzune: I've never been that close to a guy's face before... Suzune: Nghhh! Suzune: B-But he didn't notice how panicked I was, did he? I managed to keep my cool, right? Suzune: Grr... If he knew how embarrassed I was, that little shit would never let me live it down.  Suzune: Just the thought of being teased by a kid Hiroto's age pisses me off. I can't let that happen. Suzune: Well, from the way he acted... I don't think he noticed. Suzune: Maybe that's what happens when you live for your job after getting out into the real world. Suzune: I really should've gotten more experience with these things when I was in school. Suzune: Too late for that now, though. But it's not like I regret it. I'm perfectly happy with where I am these days. Suzune: ...... Suzune: Argh, enough of this crap! Agonizing about it won't change a damned thing! Suzune: I should take a bath. That oughta clear my head... Kousei: Good morning. Suzune: Hey. Suzune: Alright. Time to roll up these sleeves and get to bakin'! Kousei: Aye-aye. Kousei: ...... Suzune: (I thought I got it out of my mind, but now that we're face to face... it's all coming back. I can feel my cheeks getting red.) Suzune: (But if this kid can get back to work like nothing happened, I gotta stop acting so self-conscious. I'm an adult.) Suzune: (I can't let this distract me from my baking either. I need to focus.) Suzune: %123;Let's get this BREAD! Kousei: U-Umm, what was that for? Suzune: Nothing! Don't worry about me; just focus on those cakes. Kousei: O-Okay... Natsume: Time's up. Pencils down. Nozomi & Mei: ...... Natsume: Well done, girls. Natsume: You get a perfect score, Sumizome-san. No mistakes whatsoever. Nozomi: Yes! Mei: Way to go, Nozomi-chan! Nozomi: Aww, thanks! Must be all the extra sleep I've been getting! Natsume: You've still got a few mistakes here and there, Hiuchidani-san, but otherwise, you did very well. Natsume: As long as there aren't any terribly difficult questions on your exam, I think you should be fine. Mei: Thank you very much! I owe it all to you and Kousei-senpai! Kousei: Glad to help. But the real challenge starts tomorrow. Natsume: Don't get complacent just yet. Mei: I promise I won't let the time you've spent tutoring me go to waste! Natsume: You don't have to worry about that. Kousei: Right. Worry about not failing first. Kousei: Don't get too hung up on questions you don't immediately know the answer to. Make sure you have enough time to finish everything. Mei: Got it! Kousei: Lastly, have some faith in all the studying you've been doing and don't stay up cramming tonight. Mei: I won't! I don't want to doze off in the middle of my exams. Kousei: Good. You'll be fine. Natsume: Starting tomorrow, you guys can take a break from work until your exams are over. Natsume: We'll see you again once you're finished. Nozomi: Okay! "

I feel light as a feather today. Nozomi: Sleep really IS important, huh? Nozomi: My own body feels totally different from usual. In fact, it almost feels a little weird. Nozomi: Alrighty then. Time to get changed. Nozomi: Hm? Nozomi: Huh? Nozomi: *gasp*! Nozomi: Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh?! Mei: What was that?! Natsume: Was that Sumizome-san? It came from the break room... Kanna: T-Takamine-san... Don't tell me you gave into your lust and violated her?! Mei: Oh God... Mei: Ahhh! Mei: Senpai, y-y-y-you animal! Natsume: Ugh. What a scumbag. Kousei: Is no one going to question how I could possibly be in two places at once? Kanna: We're just poking fun, relax. Mei: But that scream was definitely Nozomi-chan's! Natsume: It didn't sound like she was in danger or anything... I wonder what happened? Kousei: I'd better go check it out. Natsume: Hold it. Where do you think you're going? Sumizome-san's in the middle of changing right now. Are you trying to peep on her, you damned pervert? Mei: Senpai... To think I trusted you! Kousei: Ouch... It's hard to tell if you're serious. Kousei: I'm kidding, alright? You guys can go check on her. I'm going back to the kitchen. Kanna: Come on. Let's go see if she's okay. Mei: R-Right! Mei: Nozomi-chan, what happened?! Are you hurt?! Nozomi: Huh?! Oh, no, I'm fine! It's... It's nothing. Natsume: Looks like you've finished changing without issue. Kanna: But then what was that scream about? Nozomi: Sorry! I got a little spooked, that's all. My, um, my backpack suddenly fell onto the floor, you see! Kanna: Oh, did it? Natsume: Well, I'm glad there's no emergency. Nozomi: Of course there's no emergency! Aha! Ahaha! Nozomi: (Th-This is way too embarrassing to say. I can't... I can't believe...) Nozomi: (I can't believe I forgot to wear a bra today!) Nozomi: (No WONDER my body feels so light! I wasn't wearing a bra! I was going commando! THAT'S why something seemed off!) Nozomi: (That's what I get for oversleeping... But I much rather would've left my sleeping bra on than go braless!) Nozomi: (U-Urk... Maybe I should just fess up so I can go home to get my bra... But I'm too embarrassed to say anything!) Kanna: It's about that time. Natsume: We'd better open the cafe. Mei: C'mon, Nozomi-chan. Time to work hard, then study hard! Nozomi: Huh? O-Oh, right! L-Let's do it! Nozomi: Urk... Nozomi: W-Welcome to Cafe Stella! Please have a seat over here. Nozomi: Here's your menu. Once you've decided on your order, let me know. Nozomi: ...... Nozomi: (*sigh*... I hope no one's noticed. But most of our customers are women, so they probably have!) Nozomi: (What if they think I'm some kind of pervert who gets off on working without underwear on--Ahhh?!) Landlady: Excuse me. Nozomi: Y-Yes! Nozomi: Oh, Mrs. Landlady! It's been a while. Landlady: Hello, dear. It looks like business is going well. Nozomi: All thanks to you. Landlady: All I did was rent you the building. It's your hard work that's brought all these customers here. Nozomi: Thank you very much. Nozomi: (We're just having a normal conversation, but I can't stop thinking about my boobs!) Nozomi: (I had no idea not wearing a bra could be THIS thrilling...) Nozomi: (Oh God, this better not become a habit. *sniffle*...) Landlady: Umm... Nozomi: Oh, yes! What can I get for you? Landlady: Could I get a cup of this Colombian coffee? And a sandwich, as well. Nozomi: Certainly. I'll have those out to you shortly. Nozomi: Order coming in! One egg sandwich, please! Kousei: Got it. Suzune: Can you handle this one? Kousei: Sure. Right after I finish with this. Kousei: Could you bring out the sandwich plates for me, Nozomi? The other ones are in the dishwasher right now. Nozomi: Where were they again? Kousei: That shelf, up there. Nozomi: What? Kousei: The top shelf. You see it? Nozomi: O-Oof... Kousei: Everything okay? Nozomi: Yeah! I'm fine. Nozomi: (I REALLY don't want to stretch out my body right now... but I can't exactly say that either.) Nozomi: Hngh... Kousei: Oh, by the way, Nozomi. Nozomi: Ahh?! Wh-What? Don't stare at me, please! Kousei: Why not? Nozomi: Well, umm... Nevermind. Anyway, what were you going to say? Kousei: I was just wondering how our customers were doing. Nozomi: All the tables are full, so there's probably going to be a line forming soon. Kousei: Alright. I'd better not keep anyone waiting then. Kousei: You okay, by the way? You seem a little stiff. Did you sleep uncomfortably or something? Nozomi: Y-Yeah, something like that. But you should be focusing on your cooking, Kousei-kun, not me! Kousei: ...... "

Somei: Don't you have to get back to work, though? Kousei: Oh, crap! I forgot! Somei: Speaking of the cafe, I wouldn't say no to a slice of cake next time you visit! Kousei: Well, I guess. But I thought you were about to be discharged soon? Somei: Yeah, I am. Kousei: In that case, you might as well come by the cafe yourself. Somei: Ahh, sure. I'll think about it. Kousei: By the way, do you think I could get your phone number? Somei: Oh-ho! And you said you're not a cheater. She's not gonna be happy to hear this! Kousei: Please don't joke about that. She can be seriously scary when she gets mad. Somei: Why do you want my number then? Oh, are you gonna introduce me to one of your guy friends? Kousei: Hmm. Well, if you're serious, I guess I could introduce you to one of my college buddies. Somei: Wait. Seriously? Kousei: Sure, it's not that big of a deal. Kousei: I won't ask you to do anything for me in return... but maybe you'd be willing to give me some advice? Natsume: How does kissing feel so good? All we're doing is putting our lips together... Natsume: If this is what kissing feels like, then... Female Nurse: Oh? Has your boyfriend already left? Natsume: He came here during his break at work, so he couldn't stay long. Female Nurse: You're a lucky girl. Not many guys would come see their girlfriend every day of the week. Natsume: ...... Female Nurse: Oh, no need to blush. Female Nurse: There's no reason a pretty girl like you shouldn't have a man or two around her arm. You might not think it, but I was quite the playgirl back in my younger days. Natsume: I'm fine with just the one, actually. Female Nurse: Oh, you're more pure-hearted than I expected. Natsume: Anyway, um... there's something I'd like to ask. Female Nurse: What's that? Natsume: If I leave the hospital tomorrow as scheduled, will I be able to go back to my life as usual? Female Nurse: Well, yes. Natsume: So I should be able to take hot baths, and engage in a bit of... ph-physical activity? Female Nurse: That shouldn't be a problem. But it'll also depend on what kind of physical activity you... Female Nurse: Ahh. So THAT'S what you mean. Female Nurse: Most girls your age are interested in those things, all the more so if they have a boyfriend. Heck, back in my younger days, I-- Natsume: Ngh! Female Nurse: Well, maybe another time. But I get it--you can't exactly ask Dr. Miyama a question like that. Alright. I'll try to ask him for you as discreetly as I can. Natsume: I'd, um, appreciate that... Female Nurse: Oh, how I wish I was young like you again. Kousei: ...... Suzune: Try relaxing a bit more, will you? Kousei: Easier said than done. I can't help but worry. Kanna: Did the tests come back okay? Kousei: Yeah, that's what she texted me. Said she was clear to be discharged today. Suzune: Alright. The caprese-style pasta's ready to go out. Kanna: I'll take it. Kanna: Here is your caprese-style pasta. I'll bring you your sachertorte and blend coffee once you've finished. Kanna: Please, enjoy your meal. Mikado: Welcome to Cafe Stella. Hm? Ah, if it isn't Shiki Natsume. Natsume: Hello. Mei: Huh? Oh, it's Natsume-senpai! Welcome back! Nozomi: Welcome back! Natsume: Oh, I didn't know you two were working today. Nozomi: They needed some extra help till you got back. Mei: Plus, we wanted to be here to see you! Boy, I ran here as fast as I could once school let out. Natsume: Ah. Thanks for doing that. Mei: Oh, you don't have to thank us for that! Ahaha. Mei: We've missed you a whole lot this past week. Nozomi: Since they let you out, does that mean you're all good to go now? Natsume: Yeah. I'm fine. Nozomi: Are you sure? You weren't in the hospital for as long as I thought you'd be. Kanna: Health and sickness start with the mind, after all. I'm sure those daily visits from a certain somebody did wonders to speed her recovery. Nozomi & Mei: Ahh. Natsume: You didn't have to say that out loud. Kanna: Welcome back, Natsume-san. Mikado: Welcome back. Natsume: Thanks. I'll be able to get back to work by tomorrow. Mei: What? So soon? You can rest up a little longer, if you need to. Nozomi: Yeah. If you need any help settling back into things, just ask! We're all here for you! Natsume: I will. Thank you, everyone. Kanna: But that's enough about work.

Natsume: Mhm. I'm glad to be back. Kousei: Make it non-alcoholic, please. Bartender: Certainly. Kousei: You okay after all that? I'm surprised you don't have heartburn. Natsume: A small price to pay. Humans can't live without eating good food. Kousei: You seem like you're in a good mood. Natsume: Maybe it's because I just got out of the hospital, but everything tasted so delicious. Kousei: Because... of me? Natsume: Nope. Not quite. Natsume: Not just because of you, but because of everyone. Kousei: You mean everyone at the cafe? Natsume: Yeah. I don't want to sound like I'm still hung up on this, though. Kousei: Don't worry. I'm here to listen. Natsume: See, years ago, whenever I was released from the hospital... people would always stare at me from a distance. Natsume: They didn't exactly treat me like I was helpless, but they always seemed confused, like they didn't know what to say to me. Natsume: And that's why... Bartender: Here you are, ma'am. Kousei: Stop joking about that. Kousei: If it turns out there's actually alcohol in there, I'm going to start worrying about you again. Natsume: Okay, okay. Sorry. I'll stop for today.

Natsume: Sure. I don't mind. Kousei: ...... Natsume: ...... Kousei: ...... Kousei: What's the matter? Kousei: ...... Kousei: Haha, very funny.

Natsume: Are you really going to ask me that now? Take a hint. Kousei: Yeah. Sorry. Natsume: It's my first time, so we need to do a bit more foreplay first. You know, kissing, stuff like that... Kousei: R-Right. Sorry. Kissing... Nhh... Natsume: I wasn't saying for you to kiss me down THERE! Kousei: Huh? Natsume: Why are you surprised?! Is this really news to you?! There's an order to this stuff! Kousei: O-Oh. Sorry. You're right. First things first. Kousei: Please tell me your name and age. Natsume: What am I, interviewing for the casting couch? Natsume: Oh, for crying out loud. You totally ruined the mood now. Natsume: I hope you know how humiliating this is for me. Kousei: I'm sorry. I mean it. I apologize.

Natsume: The first time you've ever initiated a kiss. Kousei: Yeah, I guess so. Kousei: I'd better pay you back for all the times you've kissed me then... Nhh... Natsume: Ahmph... Hngh... *smack* *kiss*... Nhh... Nh... *kiss* *smooch*... Mhh... Kousei: No, they're perfect. And... super soft. Natsume: Ahh, nhh... Hngh... Nhhh... Kousei: Besides, it doesn't matter whether they're big or small. I don't care about size. Natsume: Is that supposed to be a compliment? Kousei: I dunno, to be honest. I think your boobs might be hypnotizing me. Kousei: They're so soft... and your nipples are such a beautiful pink too... It's really turning me on. Natsume: Well, um, I'm glad to hear it. Kousei: ...... Natsume: Stop staring at me in silence, will you? It's embarrassing. Kousei: Sorry, I didn't mean to. Kousei: *lick* *suck*... Your nipples are delicious, Natsume...

Kousei: Well, I need to get a good look. Kousei: Don't wanna put it in the wrong hole, y'know... Natsume: Yeah, but... It doesn't look weird, does it? Kousei: It's beautiful. Seriously. That's the only word that comes to mind. Kousei: Is that not convincing enough for you? Natsume: No, I never said that... *pant* *pant*... *pant*... Urk... You're just staring so hard... Kousei: ...... Natsume: And now you go all quiet on me again. Kousei: Ah, err, sorry. I'm not doing it on purpose. I just can't tear my eyes away... Natsume: *pant*... *pant*... *pant*... *pant*... Kousei: Your vagina's so amazing. Natsume: Huh? What do you mean? Does it look weird? Kousei: No, of course not. Kousei: It's just, this is my first time doing any of this... All I can say is, it's amazing. Natsume: R-Really? Umm, how else would you describe it? Kousei: Let's see... Natsume: Delicious? What are you... N-No, wait. You're... Don't tell me you're... Ahh! Kousei: Nhh... *smooch* Natsume: Ngghhh?! Kousei: Your pussy? Natsume: Ngh! Don't say it outright! Natsume: You didn't hate putting your mouth on my p-pu... did you? You don't have to force yourself. Kousei: I don't hate it one bit. I love every part of you, Natsume. If anything, I want to lick it even more. Kousei: What about you, though? Do you not want me to lick it? Natsume: It's just... embarrassing. That's the worst part... but I don't mind it. Kousei: Alright. In that case... Natsume: Ahh?! Nghh... Mhh... Urk... Ahh! Kousei: *lick* *lick*... *slurp* Natsume: S-Sto... Not there... Ahh! It's too embarrassing... being licked there... Nhh! Natsume: Ah, *pant* *pant*... Do people usually have to go this far? Kousei: *lick... Not that I'd know... but I'm pretty sure this is a normal part of foreplay. Natsume: I'm just a little worried that you're getting most of your information from porn. Kousei: Well, judging from your reactions, it seems like you like this. Natsume: I mean... Kousei: Can I keep kissing you down here? I want to taste you even more, Natsume. Natsume: You promise you'll stop? Kousei: Sure... If I can pump the brakes in time. Kousei: But sorry in advance if I can't stop myself. I'm already on the verge of losing control as is. Kousei: *lick*... *lick* *slurp*... *kiss* *kiss*... *suck*... Natsume: Ahhh... Ahh, ah, ah... ahhh... Eeek?! Natsume: Ahhh?! Ahh... ah, ah, ah, ahhh! Kousei: I just tried focusing my kisses on a specific spot... *kiss* *suck* *kiss* *lick*... Natsume: Ahhh! W-Wait, not there... Noooo! My body's... tingling so much... Ahhh! Kousei: Nhh... Does it hurt? Natsume: It doesn't hurt, but I'm scared of how much my body's tingling. Kousei: Does that mean you want me to stop? Natsume: No, but... *pant* *pant*... A-Are you going to keep kissing me? Kousei: I thought you said you were scared? Natsume: I... I am... but you want to keep going, don't you? Kousei: Of course. But if you don't want me to, I won't; I'll stop here. Kousei: So tell me what you want, Natsume. Natsume: Urk... I-I know you already know what I'm going to say... Natsume: You're teasing me on purpose, aren't you? Kousei: That's not--completely untrue, I guess. Natsume: Nrgh... Kousei: But I don't want to do anything you don't like. That's the truth. Kousei: That's why I want you to say it clearly. Because once we go any further, I get the feeling I won't be able to stop myself. Natsume: Fine... Fine. Keep going. Natsume: I don't hate how much it tingles. It's a little scary, but I want you to keep going. Keep kissing me down there... Kousei: It's your own fault for being so wet down here. *lick* *lick* *kiss*... Natsume: Maybe, but you're definitely making those sounds on purpose... Ahhhh! Ah, ah, ah... ahh! Kousei: Wow... You just keep getting wetter and wetter... *lick* *smack*... Natsume: Ahhhh! I-I can't help it... You're kissing it in such a lewd way... Mhhhh! Kousei: I can be even lewder, you know. Natsume: Ah, ahh! Nooo... That's so dirty--ahh! Ahhh! Kousei: *suck* *slurp*... *lick* *lick*... *kiss*... Kousei: *kiss* *pant*... *pant*... *lick* *lick*... *kiss* *suck* Natsume: It feels, too good... I-I can't... *pant*... Hnghh! Natsume: What? *pant*... *pant*... S-Sorry... But if you keep kissing me like that, I... Hngghhh! Natsume: I can't, I can't, I can't... It feels too good! Ahhh, ahhh, eek! Kousei: Well, as long as I'm making you feel good, I'm happy... *suck* *lick*... Natsume: K-Keep... Keep licking my p-pu... that spot... Kiss it more. Kousei: *kiss*... *slurp* *suck*... Natsume: Ahhhhhh! Ah, ah, ahhh! Yes! That feels amazing... Ahhhhh! Kousei: Your reactions make me really happy, Natsume... *kiss* *lick* *lick*... *suck*... Natsume: Ah, ah! Nooo... No more... Ngh! I can't take this... Ahh! Natsume: S-Something's coming! Please, stop! Any more and I'll... Ah, ah, ahh! Kousei: Nhh... *suck* *slurp* *lick*... Natsume: Ahhh! I can't... I can't, I can't... ahh... I'm really gonna--! Natsume: Ah, ah, ahhhhhhhhhhhn! Kousei: You came, didn't you? Natsume: *pant*... *pant*... This is my first time... but I feel so happy... *pant* *pant* *pant* *pant*... Natsume: Wow... My head's gone all mushy... *pant* *pant*... Kousei: Should we take a little break? Natsume: Ngh... No... If we wait, I'll start getting scared again... Natsume: So let's keep going... Let's... have s-sex. Kousei: I haven't even put it in, though... Kousei: Wait--huh?! Don't tell me I just lost my virginity without even knowing it?! Natsume: Oh, hush, you idiot. That's not the only part of sex that feels good. Natsume: Just feeling each other's warmth like this... feels incredible... Kousei: Y-Yeah. Right, of course! Natsume: You're not listening to a word I'm saying, are you? Kousei: What do you want me to do? I'm just too excited about finally losing my virginity. Natsume: I mean, I get that, but still. Kousei: And I get to do it with the girl I love too. I couldn't be happier. Kousei: It's the only thing on my mind right now. Kousei: But you're sure about this, right? You want to go all the way with me? Natsume: Yeah. I want to go all the way. So hold me. Hold me tighter. Kousei: Sure thing. Natsume: It's a lot b-bigger than I thought... Kousei: I think I'm pretty average-sized, actually. Natsume: What?! R-Really? Kousei: Anyway... are you ready, Natsume? It's getting harder and harder to hold myself back. Natsume: I'm ready, but I want you to k-kiss me first. Kousei: I-In THIS position?! Natsume: No, you idiot. I don't mean down there... I mean a normal kiss. Nhh... Natsume: Ahh! *pant* *pant*... *pant*... M-My belly... feels so hot... Kousei: Ngh... Holy shit... Natsume: *pant* *pant*... I-It doesn't feel weird for you... does it? Kousei: Not at all. It feels amazing. Kousei: Your pussy is so warm, and the way it's sucking on me... it's squeezing me so tight. Kousei: And yet it's pulling me deeper still... I've never felt anything like this before. Seriously, it's amazing... Natsume: Me too... I've never... felt something so hot, so d-deep inside me before... Hngh... Kousei: Does it hurt? Natsume: A little bit, sure, but don't worry about me. And I doubt you're capable of stopping right now, right? Kousei: Yeah. Natsume: So I want you to kiss me instead. Make me forget about the pain. Keep me distracted. Kousei: Nhh... *kiss* Natsume: Urk... Nhh *kiss* *kiss*... *smooch*... *smack* *slurp*... Natsume: *pant* *pant*... *pant*... It doesn't hurt, so much as it feels strange... Natsume: Having this thing moving around inside of me is... *pant* *pant*... kind of amazing. Is it all the way inside? Kousei: Yeah. I think I'm all the way in. Kousei: I'm gonna start moving. Kousei: Nhh... *kiss* *smack*... Natsume: I love you... Ahhh... *kiss* *slurp*... I love you... *smooch* *swirl*... *kiss* *kiss*... Kousei: Am I moving too much for you? Natsume: N-No, I'm fine... *kiss*... Ahh, *pant* *pant*... It does hurt a little bit, but I can take it. Natsume: Ah, ah, ah... It hurts, but keep going... *pant* *pant*... What is this? Kousei: It makes me happy to know I'm making you feel good, Natsume. Natsume: It feels like I'm being split apart... like my insides are tingling... *pant*... It feels like it hurts, but it feels so good... Natsume: I-I'm... I'm not the only one feeling good, am I? Does it feel good for you? Kousei: Do you really need to ask? Your pussy feels incredible. It's making me go crazy. Natsume: Ahh?! Ah, hngh! N-Not so rough! Ah, ah, ah, ahh! Natsume: It's making... such a dirty sound! Nghhhh! Kousei: I think it's really hot, actually... You don't mind if I keep going, do you? *smooch* Natsume: Nghh... Mhh... *kiss* *kiss* *smack*... *lick* *smooch*... *kiss*... Kousei: I can't stop myself anymore, Natsume! Natsume: I can feel you... Mghh! Twitching, inside me... Nh, ngh! Stirring me up... Ah, ah, ah! Kousei: It feels way too good, kissing you up here and down there. Natsume: Ahhhh! Ah, ah, ah! You're kissing me... even deeper than before! Natsume: Hngh, ahhhh! Ahmph, *kiss* *smooch* *smack*... Nhh! Kousei: I love you, Natsume. I love you. Natsume: I love you too! Ah, ah, ahh... I love you, I love you! Natsume: It feels, so good... I want to stay like this forever... *kiss* *kiss*... *smack* *slurp*... Kousei: Natsume... If you keep kissing me like that... *smack* *kiss* *slurp*... Natsume: But it's distracting me from the pain... *kiss* *kiss* *smack*... *lick* *lick*... Kousei: Nhh! *kiss* *smooch*... *smack* Kousei: Does it hurt? Natsume: N-No... Something's... something's c-coming! It's coming... Ngghh! Natsume: It's my first time, but... Ahhhh! But I can't hold it back--ah! Ah, ah, ah, ah! Kousei: It makes me happier than anything to know that you're feeling good. In fact, it's turning me on even more. Natsume: Urk! At this rate, I'm gonna--mngh! *kiss* *smooch* *smooch* *smack*... *kiss* *kiss* Kousei: *kiss* Nh, mhh, nhh... Natsume: Ahh, I can't, I'm gonna... Ah, ah, ah! Hug me more! Tighter! Kousei: Natsume, I'm-- Natsume: Huh? W-Wait, I just... Ah?! Nooo... If you rub me right now, I'm gonna--! Natsume: Ngghhhh! Natsume: *pant* *pant*... I can't, I'm going crazy... *pant* *pant*... Kousei: Natsume... *kiss* Natsume: Mhhh, *smooch* *smack*... It's no use... Even if you kiss me, I... *smooch* *kiss* *kiss* *slurp*... Kousei: Hang in there. I'm about to cum too. Natsume: Ahhh! Ahh! Ahh! I'm gonna cum again! Kousei: Me too. This time, I'm gonna show you how I cum. Natsume: Show me... show me! I want to see you cum! Natsume: *pant* *pant*... Me too... I'm cumming again! Kiss me... kiss me! Kousei: *smooch* *kiss* *kiss* *smack*... *kiss* *smack*... Natsume: Nhhh! Ahh... *pant* *pant*... Ahmph, *kiss* *smooch* *slurp*! Kousei: Nhh, ahh... I'm cumming... Take it all! Natsume: I'll take it, I'll take it... So do it, inside--*kiss* *smack* *smack* *smooch*... Nhh, nghh! Kousei: Kh... ahh! I'm cumming, Natsume! Natsume: *smooch* *smooch* Nh, nhh, nhh, ngghhhh! Natsume: Nggggghhhhhhhhh! Natsume: Nh, nhh! Do it... I'm gonna cum again too! *kiss* *kiss* *smooch* *smooch*... Nhh, mhhhh! Kousei: Natsume! Natsume: *kiss* *kiss* *smack* *slurp* *smooch*... Nhhh, nh, ngghhhh! Natsume: Nggghhhhhhh! Kousei: Ngh, ahh... Natsume: *pant* *pant*... *pant*... I can hardly move... Kousei: Me too. Feels like I ejaculated every last bit of energy I had just now. Kousei: Just goes to show how turned on I was. And how much I love you. Natsume: Hey... I want another kiss... Kousei: Nhh... *kiss* *kiss*... *smooch*... Natsume: Mhh *smack*... Nh, nhhh... *kiss* *smooch*... "

            "Natsume: Hmm. The simpler the better, I guess. Natsume: What about you, Kousei? Kousei: I don't really like wearing flashy stuff either. Also, I prefer loose-fitting clothes. Natsume: Hmm. Kousei: Y-Yeah? Natsume: I was thinking--why don't you try working on the dining floor sometime? Kousei: You mean at work? Kousei: Where's this coming from? Natsume: You're tall, you're fit. If you clean up a bit, I think you'd look pretty handsome. Natsume: You might even find yourself some fans among the neighborhood housewives, like His Excellency. Kousei: Err, I'm not exactly interested in older women. Kousei: And I already have you anyway. I can do without the attention. Kousei: Actually, would you really be okay with other women fawning over me? Natsume: Well... Natsume: I guess I'd rather not have that. But still... Kousei: Yeah? Natsume: It feels like a bit of a shame for you to be cooped up in the kitchen all the time, with how good-looking you are... Natsume: Plus, there's that thing we talked about earlier. Kousei: The afternoon tea thing? Natsume: Yeah. We're going to be targeting housewives during that time interval, right? Natsume: In that case, we should have Akizuki-san switch places with you in the kitchen, while you work on the dining floor. Natsume: It'd be better to have more butlers as opposed to more maids. Natsume: Also... I kind of want to see you all suited up like a butler for once. Kousei: \"Suited up\"? Kousei: I'm not a big fan of tight collars, though... Natsume: After how you made me dress up in cosplay, you can't do me one favor? Kousei: Look, all I did was suggest the idea. You're the one who chose to wear it... Natsume: Stop countering me with facts and logic. Kousei: Then why make the argument if you know you're wrong? Natsume: Oh, come on. It's not like I'm asking you to wear something as embarrassing as that qipao. Kousei: Well, as long as it's similar to what Mikado usually wears, I guess it won't be too terribly embarrassing... Natsume: Oh, I know! I'll even pick out a necktie for you. Kousei: This isn't something we can just decide on the spur of the moment, though. Kousei: We'll have to discuss it with Akizuki-san and the others first. Natsume: Yeah, but you'll still be needing a new necktie. You know, since you'll be getting plenty of opportunities to wear a suit when you start job hunting. Kousei: Ugh... Don't remind me of that. Kousei: C'mon, let's grab something to eat before we leave. I'm starving. Natsume: Phew. I'm stuffed. Kousei: What do you wanna do now? Get a couple drinks at that bar again? Natsume: Hmm. I guess I wouldn't mind that, but... Kousei: But? Natsume: ...... Kousei: If you have something else in mind, I'm all ears. Natsume: I just wanted to tell you how happy I was that you put so much thought into the waitress uniform thing. Kousei: ...... Kousei: So? Natsume: S-So do you, umm, want to... have sex? Natsume: Can we? Kousei: Huh... Rather assertive today, aren't we? Natsume: Like I said, I can't express how I feel with words alone. This is the only other way I know how. Kousei: ...... Natsume: Sorry for being so horny... Kousei: Nothing wrong with that. That's what I love about you, Natsume. Say no more. Kousei: Let's go. Natsume: What? H-Hey, wait! Kousei: ...... Natsume: Y-You pick. Any of them are fine, just hurry up and choose. Kousei: A-Alright. Kousei: Yeah. It's a lot bigger than your average business hotel room, that's for sure. Almost feels like a luxury hotel--not that I've ever stayed in one. Natsume: I know what you mean. Natsume: I felt so nervous coming in. Kousei: Same here. Kousei: In fact, I'm still nervous as hell. Natsume: Yeah... My heart won't stop pounding either. Kousei: I can't help it... It's embarrassing having you take my pants off for me... Kousei: Plus, it kinda feels like you're keeping me in suspense on purpose. Natsume: I'm not. I just can't seem to get them off properly, for some reason... Natsume: What?! S-Sorry! Kousei: It's okay. Nothing to apologize for. Just, try and relax a little. It'll be easier to take them off that way. Kousei: Or should I just take them off myself? Natsume: No. Let me do it, please. I want to. Kousei: What are you talking about? You already saw it last time. Natsume: I know what it feels like, but this is my first time seeing it up close. Kousei: That sounded kinda hot. Natsume: Shut up. Natsume: Still, though... Huh... Hmm... Hrmm... I didn't know it got this big... Kousei: You're making me self-conscious the way you're examining it like that... Natsume: Oh, sorry. I don't think you have anything to be embarrassed about, though. You should be... proud of it. Kousei: Y-You think so? Natsume: W-Wait, are you... are you about to cum? Kousei: No, not yet. I'm not that quick. Kousei: But, uh... are you just planning to stare at it, or what? Natsume: O-Oh, right. A promise is a promise. Kousei: Thank you. Natsume: No, thank you. Kousei: ...... Natsume: Ah... sorry. I'm not trying to keep you waiting. It's just, while they taught me what to do... this is my first time actually doing it. Natsume: Still, I haven't even done anything yet, but you've been rock hard this entire time. Kousei: That's just how much I'm looking forward to it. Natsume: I'll do my best... *kiss* Kousei: Ngh?! Kousei: Sorry. Natsume: *giggle* That must've felt pretty good, huh? Natsume: But you know, now that I get a good look at it... it's actually kind of cute. Kousei: Well, I'll take \"cute\" over \"grotesque\" or \"alien-like\" any day of the week. Natsume: Ah... I guess I can see why some people would say those too. Kousei: Hey, listen, Natsume. Can I be frank with you? Natsume: Sure, I guess? Kousei: The way you're stopping every time I twitch... is killing me. Natsume: Oh, really? That desperate look on your face is pretty cute too. Kousei: C'mon... Natsume: Okay, okay. I get the message. Here I go... Mhh. Kousei: Ahh! Natsume: Pfft. That's some noise you let out just now. This is getting kind of fun... *giggle* Kousei: ...... Natsume: Okay, okay. I'll keep going. Now hold still... Nhh... *smooch* *smooch*... *smack*... Natsume: *kiss*... *smooch* *smooch*... *giggle* You're really starting to moan now. Kousei: No shit I am. Kousei: Ahh... Natsume: *lick* *lick*... Ahhh... *smooch* *smack*... *slurp*... Kousei: N-Natsume... Natsume: I've gotten a bit more used to it now... *slurp* *kiss* *smack*... Nh, ngh... Nhh?! Kousei: Wh-What?! Natsume: Well, something bitter's coming out... Is this poison? Kousei: The hell?! What am I, a scorpion?! Natsume: What? But it's so bitter... Natsume: And the tip is getting all wet too. What is this? Kousei: It's pre-cum, Cowper's fluid, whatever you want you want to call it. It's not poison. Just a normal bodily reaction. Natsume: Oh... So this is pre-cum. Is it supposed to be this bitter? Kousei: I guess it probably depends on your overall health? I'm really not sure, though. Kousei: Can't say I've ever tasted my own pre-cum before. Natsume: Well, as long as it isn't poisonous... *lick* *slurp* Kousei: I know you don't like bitter things, Natsume. You don't have to force yourself to taste it. Natsume: What? I'm not forcing myself. It might be bitter, but it's nowhere near as bad as coffee. I can handle this. Natsume: *lick* *lick* *slurp*... *pant* *pant*... *smack* *smooch* *slurp* Kousei: Kgh... Ahh... "

            "Kousei: Oh, right. It stands for Social Networking System, I think? Natsume: Isn't it Social Networking Service? Kanna: Hmm... Kanna: Ah! Social Networking Service, huh? I get that! Natsume: You have no idea what that is, do you? Kanna: How am I supposed to? You used way too many English words! My area of expertise is Japan only! Kousei: I mean, it's used frequently enough these days that it's basically Japanese. Natsume: In short, it refers to sites such as Facehook or Instogram, which allow you to communicate with people all over the world. Natsume: Do you ever see people fiddling with their smartphones while they're walking down the street? They're probably browsing their social media feed. Kanna: There you go again, using all these obscure words. What the heck is a smart phone? Natsume & Kousei: What? Kousei: You don't even know what a smartphone is? Natsume: Have you never used a mobile phone? Kanna: O-Of course I have! Um, the really heavy thing you put on your shoulder, right? And when you answer, you're like, \"Hullooo.\" Kousei: A brick phone? Kanna: Yeah, that's the one. Changing the subject--on the topic of new menu items, what do you think about tiramisu? Kousei: Wait, a brick phone? One of THOSE ancient things?! Natsume: I can't believe I'm asking this... but you DO know what the internet is, don't you? Kanna: The inter... net, you said? I know about local BBS systems, at least... Natsume: Huh? I'm confused now... What is a BBS? Kousei: Surely you know what the internet is if you know what BBS systems are. Mikado: It has never been necessary for Grim Reapers to communicate with the world at large. Mikado: They possess neither cellphones nor smartphones of any kind. Natsume: People like that actually exist in this day and age? Kanna: I-It's not my fault! Society evolves too quick for me! Kanna: Enough about me already! We were discussing the cafe, weren't we?! Natsume: I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but, umm... Natsume: If you don't even know what a smartphone is, did you even understand a word of our conversation earlier? Kanna: W-Well, more or less. Kanna: Basically, you were talking about using pictures of pancakes, strawberries, and cats to attract customers to our store, right? Kousei: That's the idea. Natsume: Speaking of cats... Mikado: Absolutely not. Kanna: Aww. Natsume: You didn't even let me finish. Mikado: I know what you were going to say. You wish to parade me around to our customers like some sort of... poster cat, don't you? Mikado: I refuse! I am a nobleman. I carry with me the pride of the Cat Sidhe. Mikado: I will not stoop so low as to toady myself to the likes of a mere human. Natsume: Pretty please? Mikado: Absolutely not. Natsume: I'll only feed you dry kibble for dinner from now on. Mikado: What?! H-How dare you, you scoundrel! Kousei: I can't believe a threat like that actually worked... Mikado: You do not understand the agony of eating dry kibble every single day, Takamine Kousei! Kousei: Well, yeah. I've never tried it. Kanna: Still, we've got a lot of work to do before we even get to asking His Excellency for help. Kousei: Actually, I've been thinking: why don't we hire another worker? Kousei: Of course, we'll have to warn them that there's a chance we won't ever open for business, but still... Natsume: Can we not handle this on our own? Kousei: Unlikely. You and I both have school, and our kitchen is understaffed as it is. Kousei: If we wanted to manage with just the four of us, we'd never be able to take time off. Natsume: Right... Kanna: Why don't we try putting up a few help-wanted posters and see what happens? Kanna: Oh, and before we forget--the pancakes. Natsume: I'll bet we can find plenty of recipes online. Kousei: We'll have to put our own spin on it, though. Especially if we want to make it our main item. Kousei: But to do that, we might want to consult someone with a decent amount of cooking experience. Natsume: ...... Kousei: Hmm... Nozomi: You don't often come all the way out here, though. Is it something urgent? Kousei: ...... Nozomi: Earth to Kousei-kun? Kousei: Oh, sorry. You just look so pretty. Nozomi: ...... Kousei: It's been a while since I've seen you in your miko outfit... I can't stop myself from staring. Kousei: Were you always this cute? Also--is it just me, or has your hair grown longer? Nozomi: O-Oh, yeah. They're just extensions. I thought I'd give long hair a try. What do you think? Kousei: Hmm. I like it. You look really cute with long hair. Nozomi: Aww, thanks. Ehehe. Nozomi: So--what are you after? Kousei: What do you mean? Nozomi: You're up to something. I can smell it. Kousei: How? I'm just complimenting your outfit... Nozomi: That's exactly what's so suspicious. Honestly, your compliments aren't even flattering. Kousei: Why not? Nozomi: You make it sound like I'm wearing a cosplay or something. It's embarrassing. Kousei: Why go through the effort of wearing hair extensions then? Nozomi: The tourists who visit the shrine like to take pictures of me in my shrine maiden outfit. I'm not complaining, though--they're always polite about it. Nozomi: I just wanna look good if I'm gonna have my picture taken. You know what I mean? Kousei: Guess I'm not the only one who thinks you're cute. All those tourists seem to think so too. Nozomi: I knew it. You're DEFINITELY up to no good, you creep. Kousei: Well, I want something, but it's nothing bad... Nozomi: See?! What did I say! Kousei: Look, just let me explain before you jump to conclusions! Nozomi: *sigh*... Can I put my broom away first, at least? Kousei: So in short, we're looking for someone who knows how to make pancakes. Kousei: And I was thinking you might be able to help. Nozomi: I've never made pancakes before. Kousei: Never? Nozomi: To me, pancakes are best enjoyed when someone else makes them for me. Nozomi: I mean, I could make them if I really wanted to... but I'd be so focused on making it perfect that it'd probably be an awful experience. Kousei: Oh... Kousei: Let me ask you this then: do you ever go to cafes and order pancakes? Nozomi: Not by myself, but I sometimes go with my friends on weekends. Nozomi: Sometimes it's just a quick stop while we're out, and sometimes we specifically go out to a fancy restaurant. Either way, they're always super delicious! Kousei: Well, if you go to fancy restaurants, surely you know how to make a good pancake, no? Nozomi: By that logic, anyone can be a good voice actor just by watching anime. Kousei: Touche... Kousei: Still, though, I'm sure anything you make would taste amazing. Nozomi: That's not very convincing coming from the person who always shovels down my cooking in complete and utter silence. Kousei: Only because it's so delicious. Nozomi: Well, I appreciate the kind words, even if you're just sweet-talking me... but I'm still not too confident it'd work out. Kousei: I'm not sweet-talking you; I'm serious. Nozomi: Well, the thing is... cooking and baking are two completely different disciplines. Nozomi: When cooking, you can usually get away with measuring things by eye, but with baking, every ingredient needs to be precisely the exact amount, or else it won't turn out right. Nozomi: It might not rise properly, or it might not harden enough. Or the surface might end up cracking. It's more like doing chemistry than anything. Nozomi: I wouldn't mind baking for you personally, Kousei-kun... but if this is something that's going to be sold at a restaurant, you're better off finding someone who knows what they're doing. Kousei: Ah... Well, if it's not that easy, I guess that's for the best. Nozomi: Hmm, do you need help with anything else? Nozomi: I'd be happy to do anything that's not the pancake-making. Or is that a prerequisite for the job? Kousei: Oh, you seem pretty interested? Nozomi: Well, I've always wanted to try working at a cafe! I'd love to give it a shot, if you'll have me. Nozomi: What? You don't seem too thrilled about the idea of me working there. Kousei: That's not true! Cute, cheerful, AND a great cook? Wow! We'd love to have you! Nozomi: You're obviously just messing with me. Kousei: We'd greatly benefit from you working there. You could lend us a hand in the kitchen when things get busy, right? Nozomi: Well, sure. As long as I have all the recipes. Kousei: Perfect. Kousei: But I should warn you, there's no guarantee we'll actually open for business. Kousei: Actually, before we get into anything... What about your shrine maiden work? Will it not be hard for you to juggle two jobs? Nozomi: I'm sure I can figure something out with my dad. Nozomi: Besides, I only work here 'cause I'm in the family. Did you know? I don't even get paid to do this. And my allowance isn't anything to brag about, either. Kousei: Well, your old man's not exactly rich. Nozomi: All the more reason for me to get my own job then. Girls my age need money. Kousei: Alright. I can't hire you on the spot, but I'll talk to my coworkers about it as soon as I can. Nozomi: Thanks! I really appreciate it. Nozomi: Just, uh... keep in mind that I've never had a real job before, so it might take me a while to get the hang of things. Kousei: That's fine. Kousei: I know you'll do great, Nozomi. I believe in you. Nozomi: ...... Nozomi: You know, Kousei-kun. I think you might be a natural-born gigolo. Kousei: What, because all I do is rely on others. Nozomi: No, 'cause you're good at buttering people up. Kousei: You think so? Nozomi: It's true. Kousei: Hmm... Well, I guess I better work on improving my domestic skills. Nozomi: If you're worried about your future, I suggest you look for a real job instead. Kousei: Hey, taking care of the house is a legitimate job. Nozomi: Ugh... This guy's actually considering becoming a gigolo. What a creep. Kousei: You know, that term doesn't sit right with me. I'd much rather be called a house-husband, or a stay-at-home dad. Nozomi: Now you're just arguing semantics. Whatever gave you that silly idea in the first place? Kousei: Don't worry about it. Anyway, are there any cafes in the area that you'd recommend? Nozomi: Cafes? Hmm... If you're looking for a place within walking distance... Wait, why do you ask? Kousei: While we were talking about you joining us, I realized something. Kousei: I've never actually been to a real fancy cafe before. Kousei: So I figure I should at least go and experience one for myself. Also, it should be a place that's popular among girls your age, if possible. Nozomi: Okay. Well, if that's what you're looking for... I just so happen to know a great place that sells pancakes a couple of stations from here. Kousei: Great. Kousei: Are you free after this? Nozomi: I've finished sweeping, so I'm free to go home once I change out of these clothes. Kousei: Wanna go there with me then? I'm kinda scared to go to one of those fancy places alone. Nozomi: Don't brazenly admit how much of a wimp you are. Kousei: Come on, please? I can't walk into a cafe full of girls by myself. Nozomi: *sigh*... Oh, alright. But you're paying. Kousei: Sure. Nozomi: Great! Wait one sec while I go get changed! Cafe Worker: Welcome! Party of two? Kousei: Yeah. Cafe Worker: Please follow me! Nozomi: Oh my God, it's SO hard to decide! Look, doesn't all of this stuff sound super delicious? Kousei: Hmm... I'll go with the basic pancakes. And a blend coffee. Nozomi: Alright... I think I'll go with the strawberry-chocolate pancake! Kousei: You love strawberries, don't you? Nozomi: Huh? Well, yeah. Both the tart autumn ones, and the sweeter variety they harvest in the winter! Kousei: Hmm. I guess my dad was right on the money with the strawberry thing. Nozomi: What is this? Kousei: Ah, nothing. Cafe Worker: Are you ready to order? Nozomi: Yes. I'll have the strawberry-chocolate pancakes, and an Assam tea. And for him, the regular pancakes and a blended coffee. Oh, and with butter, please! Cafe Worker: Alright. I'll have your food out to you in just a moment. "

            "Kousei: ...... Kousei: Speaking of which, it's almost White Day. Kousei: Thanks for the chocolate cake last time, everyone. Suzune: Speaking of which, we never heard what you thought of it, did we? Kousei: It was really good. Thanks for adding that hint of bitterness to it. Kanna: Nozomi-san told us you preferred it that way. Mei: Suzune-san was pretty much teaching us as we went along, but it really did turn out delicious! Suzune: You were sampling it way too much, though. Mei: Ahaha! Sorry about that. Kousei: Anyway, I wanted to give you guys these baked sweets as thanks. Nozomi: Very well. Nozomi: Wow, you got individual gifts for all of us? Thanks! Suzune: I kinda feel bad since we just gave you one thing from all of us. Kousei: It's fine. I just thought it'd look better if I wrapped everyone's gifts individually. Kousei: But seeing as I had to buy enough for all of you, the portions are a little small. Sorry. Mei: Oh, you don't have to worry about that. This is more than enough. Thank you. Kanna: Absolutely. It's the thought that counts, not the size of the gift. Nozomi: But speaking of size, that big gift you've got there must be for Natsume-san, right? Kousei: Well, yeah. Suzune: Are those baked goods as well? Kousei: Yeah. I also got her some tea leaves, and a couple other small accessories. Stuff like that. Kousei: She tends to dislike holidays that we're socially obliged to celebrate, see. Suzune: I doubt she'd be unhappy with a gift from her boyfriend. Kousei: Well, I hope so. Suzune: Honestly, she'd probably be MORE upset if you arbitrarily decided that she didn't want anything. Kanna: I agree. Mei: You have to be mindful of your girlfriend's feelings. Nozomi: No girl wants to think you've forgotten about her. Kousei: I'll take that advice to heart. Thanks. Natsume: I've got another order for you. A sandwich and a pancake with chocolate sauce, on the double. Kousei: Got it. Kousei: Can you make the sandwich, Suzune-san? Suzune: Sure. I'll get to it once I'm done cooking this. Kousei: Thanks. Kousei: Well, it is White Day. Suzune: Too bad you have to spend the day working, though. Kousei: No way around it, unfortunately. And I can always give Natsume her gift after work. Kousei: The stuff I got her isn't going to spoil anytime soon, so I'm in no rush. Suzune: Then how about this? As long as you keep up the good work, I'll handle the cleanup by myself so you can leave a little early. Kousei: ...... Suzune: What? Too grateful for words? Kousei: No. Just wondering if pigs are going to start flying. Suzune: Haha. Very funny, you little snot. Kousei: I'm just messing with you. No need to take it so seriously. Kousei: But are you sure about this? Suzune: Yeah, why not? It's not gonna kill me. And I'd hate to stand in the way of your relationship. Kousei: Thank you! Suzune: You scratch my back, I scratch yours; that's how it works. Anyway, get back to focusing on that frying pan. Kousei: Yes, ma'am! Nozomi: Order coming in! I need a strawberry pancake and a strawberry parfait, please! Kousei: Coming right up. Kousei: Thanks, boss. I'll leave the rest to you then. Kousei: My bad. I didn't think you were already changing. Natsume: You really need to be more careful. If another girl was changing in here, I would've crushed your eyeballs. Kousei: It's hard to tell if you're joking sometimes. Natsume: Anyway, the others insisted I go home early today. I think they were trying to be considerate of us. Natsume: Same thing happen to you, I assume? Kousei: I wouldn't say \"insisted\". Suzune-san just offered to take care of the cleanup for me. Natsume: Ah. Well, if they're willing to do all of this for us, I guess we might as well accept their kindness. Kousei: Yeah. Kousei: So, listen. I've got something for you, Natsume. Kousei: It's your White Day gift, but, umm... this is my first time giving my girlfriend anything like this. Kousei: So if you aren't happy with it, try not to get TOO upset at me. Natsume: Oh, relax. Don't start making excuses before I've even seen it. Kousei: Sure. Natsume: Let's see... Ohh, sweets. And tea leaves too? Wait, aren't these pretty expensive? Kousei: Well, it's a return gift. Kousei: White Day gifts are supposed to be three times the value of the gift received, right? Natsume: I hear people expect it to be five times, these days. Kousei: Seriously? Talk about greedy... Natsume: Well, some people, anyway. But I don't think an expensive gift necessarily makes for a better gift. Natsume: Rather than spending three times the money, I'd be happier if you spent three times as much time with me instead. Kousei: I'll remember that. Natsume: But that doesn't mean I'm not happy with this gift. Thanks. Natsume: Let's have some of this tea together next time. I'll brew it for you. Kousei: Sounds great. Natsume: Hm? There's something else in here... Natsume: ...... Natsume: What is this? A blindfold? Kousei: A little something extra. Natsume: Ahem. Kousei: I mean, you gave me an extra kiss with your chocolate too, remember? Kousei: And that meant I had to give you something worth three times as much. Kousei: So, after a lot of thinking, I came up with the idea of a blindfold... Do you like it? Natsume: What kind of question is that? Are you stupid? Kousei: Come on! How am I supposed to know what three times a kiss is worth?! Natsume: Well, yes, but a BLINDFOLD? Are you serious? Kousei: Doing it while blindfolded is pretty exciting, though. From what I've read, at least. Natsume: ...... Kousei: Hey, you promised you wouldn't get upset! Come on! Natsume: That's for me to decide, not you, Kousei. Kousei: Sorry. Natsume: *sigh*... Natsume: You really are a pervert. Kousei: ...... Natsume: So? When are we trying it out? Kousei: Wait. Really? Natsume: What? You don't want to? I thought you said it was... pretty exciting? Natsume: Oh, shut it. Kousei: Anyway... how about tonight? Kousei: ...... Kousei: O-Oh, sorry. I spaced out for a second there. Kousei: I gotta ask, though. Uhh, why are you wearing your uniform? Natsume: I thought you'd like it more if I did... Kousei: You must really think I'm some kind of pervert, Natsume. Kousei: I mean, I won't deny I like it. But still. Natsume: I'm starting to get kind of excited too. Kousei: I haven't even done anything yet, though. Natsume: It's pitch black in front of me, I can't see a thing, and my arms are tied too... Kousei: But you like it, don't you? Natsume: Well... I guess I do. Kousei: Natsume... Natsume: Don't worry. I can actually feel my way around... surprisingly easily. Kousei: Nhh... Ah... Natsume: *giggle*... You're already starting to moan. Kousei: Yeah, 'cause I'm ridiculously turned on right now. Natsume: I can see that. In fact... aren't you even bigger than usual? Kousei: I dunno... I can't really tell myself. Natsume: I can't believe seeing your girlfriend like this makes you this big... You really are a hopeless pervert. Kousei: Is it really that noticeable? Natsume: It is... See? Ahmph. Kousei: Ah... Ngh?! Natsume: Nh... My mouth's getting all sticky... Don't tell me you're leaking pre-cum already? Kousei: Y-Yeah... I don't know if I'm actually bigger than usual or not... Kousei: But I am incredibly aroused, I can tell you that much. Natsume: Are you gonna cum soon? Kousei: If I let my guard down, I just might. Natsume: *giggle*... Well, you'd better hold it in. I'm just getting started here. Nhhh... *lick* *lick*... Kousei: *gulp*... Kousei: Ngh! Kousei: You seem... eager. Natsume: Hmm? Do I? *lick*... *slurp* *slurp* *lick*... Kousei: The way you use your tongue... Kousei: Don't tell me you... actually want my cum? Do you... actually think it tastes good? Natsume: What? Please. How could something that smelly and sticky taste good? If anything, it's disgusting. Kousei: O-Oh. Natsume: How about I feed it to you mouth-to-mouth next time so you can see for yourself? Natsume: I never said that. Kousei: Huh? Natsume: It's smelly and goopy, and in a lot of ways, kind of gross. Natsume: But... I never said I hated it. *lick* *lick*... *slurp* *slurp*... *suck* Kousei: Ahh... Ngh... O-Oh. Kousei: In that case... please, keep going. Natsume: Nhh... *kiss* *kiss* *lick* *lick*... Kousei: Ahhh! You sure you've got that blindfold on properly? Natsume: Yeah, I think so... Why? Kousei: Because you're way too precise... Kousei: You shouldn't be able to do this if you can't see, right? Natsume: Of course I can. After all... how many times do you think I've been bullied by this dick of yours? Natsume: I've already memorized its shape... *lick* *lick*... *slurp* *slurp*... Kousei: Ngh, ah... *pant* *pant*... *pant*... Natsume: *giggle*... You're moaning so much. Does it feel that good? *slurp*... Nh... Natsume: Well, too bad... You can't cum yet. Not until I say so... Ahmph. Kousei: Ah, ahh! Natsume: *slurp*... Mhhh... Nhhh! Mhh, mngh... *slurp* *slurp* Kousei: Your mouth is so warm, Natsume... Ngh! Natsume: *slurp* *suck* *suck*... I'll warm you up even more... *slurp* *slurp* *slurp* Kousei: Ngh! Natsume: I don't need to see now that it's in my mouth, do I? Ngh, nhh... *suck* *suck*! Kousei: Still, though... Ngh... This feels even better than usual. Natsume: *slurp*... *slurp* *slurp*... Ahh! *pant*... *pant*... Natsume: Probably because you're turned on more than usual. Kousei: You're not giving me much of a choice! Natsume: You want to shoot out your thick, sticky loads, don't you? Ahmph... *slurp* *slurp* *suck* *suck* *suck*! Kousei: Ngh, ahh... If you suck that hard... Natsume: You can't cum yet, okay? Not yet... *suck*... *suck* *suck* *suck*! Kousei: Then please, slow down a little! Natsume: *giggle*... You're twitching so happily, though. But it doesn't matter how much you struggle... you're not getting away. Natsume: Nh... *suck* *suck* *slurp*... *suck* suck* *slurp*... Nghh! Kousei: Ahhhh! You're sucking so hard! Natsume: Nhh... Nhh *slurp*... *suck* *suck* *suck*... *slurp* *slurp* Kousei: Natsume, that... that feels amazing... And your expression too... It's so lewd... Natsume: *suck* *suck*... Nhhh... *lick* *lick* *lick*... Natsume: Shut up... You can't even see my face with this blindfold on... *slurp* *suck* Kousei: Even with the blindfold, I can tell how excited you're getting. Kousei: You're enjoying this, aren't you? Natsume: *suck* *suck*... *suck* *suck* *slurp*... Natsume: This lewd taste and smell... it's getting even thicker... Mghh... Nh, nhhh... Nhh! Kousei: Ahhhhh?! Kousei: Natsume, that... A-Ahh... If you suck me like that, I'm gonna--! Natsume: Nhh... Nh, nhh... *suck* *suck* *slurp* *slurp*! Kousei: Wait! Ahh! Kousei: You say that, but... Ahh, I can't! Natsume: *suck* *suck* Fine... You can cum. I want you to cum... Shoot out your hot, sticky stuff... *slurp*... Kousei: Ahh, Natsume! I'm gonna cum... I can't hold it anymore! Natsume: Mhhh? Nh... Nh... *suck*! Kousei: W-Wait, let go! If you don't let go I'm gonna--! Natsume: It's fine, do it... I'll swallow it for you again... Mhhhh *suck*! Kousei: You said it was... Ngh... Gross, didn't you? Don't... Ah... Force yourself... Natsume: I'm not... I'll swallow it... I wanna drink... your freshly-squeezed cum... Can't I? Kousei: N-Natsume! Kousei: A-Ahh! I'm gonna cum... I'm gonna cum, Natsume! Natsume: Nhhh, nghh... Ngh... Mhhh... *suck* *suck* *slurp*! Natsume: *slurp* *slurp* *suck* *suck* *suck*... *suck*! Kousei: Ahhhh! Nggghhhhhh! Natsume: Mhhh?! Hngh, nhh, nhhh... *pant* *pant*... Nh, nhhh... Natsume: Ngh... *gulp*... *gulp*... *gulp*... Kousei: Ngh! Natsume: Nghhhh... Ahh! *cough* *cough*! *pant* *pant* *pant*... Natsume: It's so thick... *cough* *cough*! I-I thought was going to die... choking to death on your cum... *pant* *pant*... Kousei: I want to mark you as mine. Natsume: Mhh? Nhh... Nhhh... Ahh! *pant* *pant*... *pant*... Natsume: Well, if you put it that way... Fine... *lick* *smack* *slurp*... *lick* *lick*... Kousei: Ah, right there... That's the spot... Natsume: *lick* *slurp*... *lick* *lick* *suck*... *slurp* *slurp* *smack* Kousei: Nhh... Ngghhhhh! Natsume: *gasp*?! Nhh, ngh, nhh! Ahhh! Nghhh! Natsume: Ahhh! *pant* *pant*... Kousei: Who wouldn't, after all that? *pant* *pant*... Natsume: You're all out of breath too... Here, let me clean you up... Mhh *lick* *lick*... *pant* *pant*... Natsume: Actually... it's kind of hard to clean you properly with the blindfold on. Can I take it off yet? Kousei: ...... Kousei: No, not yet. Natsume: What? Why not? Kousei: Because... I'm the only one who's been feeling good so far. Now it's my turn to return the favor--three times as much. Natsume: What are you--? Kousei: C'mon... Up you go. Natsume: Huh? A-Ahh, wait! Kousei: Here we--go! Natsume: Ahhh?! Kousei: ...... Natsume: What? Why aren't you saying anything? Stop it, you're making me nervous... Kousei: Your boobs are crazy soft... Natsume: Nhh, ah... W-Well... They are natural... Kousei: There is one spot... that's rather hard, though. Natsume: Ahh! Ah, ah... Nhh... Not my nipples... *pant*... Ahh... Nghh... Natsume: Why is it so thrilling... being touched like this? Kousei: I love you, Natsume... Natsume: Nh, nhh?! Don't whisper in my ear like that... You're making my heart race... *pant* *pant* *pant*... Kousei: You're even hornier than usual today. Natsume: That's because... the blindfold... It's getting me so excited... Kousei: Are you that eager to do it already? Kousei: You like it, don't you? Natsume: Ahh?! Nhh, nh, nhh... Hngh! Kousei: You're already so hot and wet down here. Natsume: Because... Ah, ahh, ngh... Ngh... *pant* Ahh... Ahhh! Natsume: Don't tease me like this... *pant*... *pant*... *pant*... *pant*... Kousei: You gotta let me recover. I just came a little while ago, you know... Kousei: *pant*... *pant*... I'm sorry, Natsume. Natsume: Huh? What are you--? Kousei: I can't hold back any longer. Natsume: Ahhh?! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh! Ngghhh! Kousei: I wanted to surprise you. The truth is, I wanted to keep teasing you some more... Kousei: But you just looked so sexy, I couldn't help myself. Kousei: Are you mad? Natsume: Ah, ahhh... Nh, nhh... I don't like it when you lie... but I'm not mad. Natsume: Ahhhhhhh... Your dick... is finally... *pant* *pant*... *pant*... Kousei: Does it really make things that different? Natsume: It feels like... my other senses are becoming more sensitive... since I can't see... Kousei: Ngh... That feels good. Kousei: The way your pussy wraps around me... Natsume: I can feel your dick so clearly... bucking around inside me... Ah! Ah, ah, ah, ahhhhh! Natsume: Nhh, ahh! It feels so good... I'm going crazy! Kousei: Me too... It's like I'm losing my mind. Natsume: You were already an idiot from the start, though... *pant* *pant* *pant*... Kousei: Oh, yeah? I'm gonna make you regret saying--that! Natsume: Nhh, eek?! Ah, agh... Ahh... Right there! Kousei: Here? Natsume: Ngh, ahh! Y-Yes... I love it when you pound me there! Natsume: Huh? In a bad way? Kousei: No way. It mind-blowing. Natsume: Ah, ah... Ah, ah, ah! If you grind that spot... I'm gonna melt! Natsume: If you keep grinding me there, my heads gonna meeelt! Natsume: Ahh! Ah, ahhhh... You're digging so deep... Nhh! Kousei: I love you... I love you, Natsume... I love you, I love you, I love you... Natsume: Ah, ah, ah! Don't whisper like that... It tickles! Natsume: But... it makes me so happy... It's making me feel even better... Ah, ahh, ahhhhhhh! Kousei: Your tits are so soft... and your moans are so lewd... I love how cute you are. Natsume: Ahhhhh... I'm so happy... Ah, ah, ahh... I love you... I love you too! Kousei: Natsume, Natsume! Natsume: Ah! Ah! Ah, ah, ah! That... That feels amaziiiinggg! Natsume: Nooo! I'm really gonna turn into a pervert... If you rub me there, I'm really gonna turn into a pervert! Kousei: *pant* *pant* *pant*... Natsume... Can I take off your blindfold? Natsume: Ahh, *pant*! Wuh? Wh-Why now? Kousei: Because you sound like you're losing your mind. Kousei: I love listening to you moan... but I want to see what kind of expression you're making right now too. Natsume: N-Nooooo... You can't, you can't! Natsume: I'm making a really naughty expression right now! Ah, ahh, ahh... You can't, you can't, you can't! Natsume: Nooo, don't looook... You idiot... Kousei: I love seeing you feeling so good... It's turning me so much. Kousei: Nothing wrong with that. Go crazy. Natsume: My body's going numb... I don't know what's happening anymore! Natsume: Ah, ahhhhhh... Don't look! Don't look at my face! Kousei: You look adorable, Natsume. I love you. Kousei: Your insides feel amazing too! Your pussy feels so good... way too good! Natsume: *pant* *pant* *pant* *pant*... I'm so happy... So happy! Kousei: Me too. I love you! I love you, Natsume! Natsume: M-Me too... I love you! This is pure bliss... Ah, ah, ah, ah! Natsume: I l-love you... I love having s-sex with you! Ah, ahhh! Kousei: Natsume... Natsume! Kousei: Natsume, me too! Natsume: Nhh! Cum! Cum inside me! Natsume: Ahh! Ahhhh! I'm cumming... I'm cumming, I'm cumming! Natsume: I'm cumminnngggggg! Natsume: Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Kousei: *pant*... *pant*... Kousei: N-Natsume, I'm gonna cum... I'm gonna cum! Natsume: Do it... H-Hurry... Ahhh... Hurry, hurry! Nghh! Natsume: Ngh, ahh! I'm c-cumming... I'm cumming... Ahhhhhh... I'm cumming! Natsume: Nggghhhhhhhhhh! Kousei: *pant*... *pant*... Natsume: You came... so much... Kousei: I can't move... Feels like my whole body's gone numb... *pant* *pant* *pant*... Natsume: Me too... This felt... way better than I expected... *pant* *pant* *pant*... Kousei: Yeah... I don't think I've ever been this sensitive before. Natsume: Blindfolds are... amazing... *pant*... *pant*... *pant*... Kousei: We should use it again sometime. Natsume: I'll have to think about it. Kousei: Aww. Why do you say that? Natsume: Because... it felt way too good. I was gonna go crazy. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Well, at any rate, you don't have any complaints about it being your White Day gift anymore, right? Natsume: I... guess not. Not anymore. Kousei: Thank goodness. "

            "Kousei: I didn't expect you to actually accept my invitation today, Shiki-san. Natsume: I was on the fence, to be honest. If you'd suggested this takoyaki party out of pity for me or something, I probably wouldn't have come. Natsume: But since it seemed like you were asking more out of personal desire, I thought: \"Sure, why not?\" Kousei: Personal desire? I didn't have any ulterior motives or anything. Natsume: Is that the truth? You weren't expecting anything to happen? Not even a little? Kousei: Well... maybe a little. A man can dream, can't he? Kousei: But I'm well aware of the difference between fantasy and reality, so please, don't call the police. Natsume: I won't, relax. If I really thought you were that untrustworthy, I wouldn't have come in the first place. Kousei: Well, thanks. Natsume: Did you have fun today, Takamine-kun? Kousei: Yeah. I had fun. Natsume: How much fun? Kousei: How much? I'm not sure how I'd quantify it... Kousei: Best day of my life, maybe? I've never spent time alone with a girl during Christmas time before, after all. Kousei: But, yeah, I guess that sounds a little overly-dramatic. Still, I don't think I'll ever forget today. Natsume: Yeah. I feel that way too. Natsume: But... not everyone is the same. Kousei: Well, yeah. Fun is subjective. Natsume: It was the same back then, when I missed my friend's takoyaki party because I was in the hospital. That itself, I didn't mind. There was nothing I could have done about it, after all. Natsume: But once I got out of the hospital and went back to school... Natsume: What do you think bugged me the most? Take a guess. Kousei: The fact that everyone else was talking about how fun the party was? Natsume: Wrong. Natsume: What really bugged me was how quickly they'd forgotten about it. They said it was fun, sure, but by the time we were back in school, they were already reminiscing about New Year's and looking forward to Valentine's Day. Kousei: Hmm... Kousei: You're saying you felt like you were left behind? Natsume: That's not it either. Well, you're not exactly wrong, per se. It's a bit hard to explain, to be honest. Natsume: But either way, I didn't feel like I was part of their group anymore. And eventually, we drifted apart... Natsume: ...... Natsume: Sorry. That was a stupid thing to say. Guess I drank too much. Kousei: It's all good. I'm the one who asked in the first place. Kousei: But honestly, I feel like the alcohol just makes you a lot more talkative. Or at least, a lot more honest. Natsume: Shut up. Natsume: *sigh*... The inside of my mouth's still tingling. Kousei: Want some ice cream? I've got vanilla. Natsume: Sure, I guess. Kousei: Thanks for hanging out with me today. Kousei: It was fun. I don't get to eat takoyaki all that often, and you even ate my share of the \"surprises\" for me. Natsume: Seriously, why was I the only one who kept getting the spicy ones? Kousei: Probably because you're the one who made them. Natsume: *sigh*... Okay, I'm good from here. Thanks for walking me home. Kousei: Alright. See you tomorrow then. Natsume: See you tomorrow. Natsume: Um... I had fun today too. Thanks for inviting me over. Kousei: Glad you had fun. And glad I worked up the courage to ask. Natsume: Have a good night. Kousei: Night. "

            "Kousei: But if you're still not feeling well, we'll do a U-turn and take you right back home. Nozomi: I'm okay, really. You have class to attend too. I can make it there myself. I'll be fine, I promise. Kousei: I'm not taking no for an answer. I have a responsibility to look after you, since I'm older. I owe that much to your parents. Nozomi: F-Fine. Kousei: Could be. Natsume: Ack... You really do go to my college. Kousei: Oh, Shiki-san. Natsume: And you're even in my class... I had no idea. Kousei: Only this one. I don't know anyone else in our class, so I usually sit at the back. Natsume: Well, I don't really look around the lecture hall during class time either. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Err, um... Talk to you later. Kousei: What? Natsume: O-Oh, nothing. I wasn't going to say anything... Natsume: I just didn't expect you to go out of your way to sit somewhere else. Kousei: Err, well... You probably wouldn't appreciate me acting all chummy with you, would you? Natsume: Well, I would prefer you maintain a reasonable distance. Natsume: But we're supposed to be coworkers. If you act like we're strangers... it'll confuse me and I won't know how to act around you. It makes me feel a little awkward. Natsume: It makes me wonder if you hate me or something--you know what I mean? Kousei: Well, of course I don't hate you... Kousei: You're not gonna accuse me of being a creep for sitting next to you, though, are you? You kind of groaned when you saw me. Natsume: I didn't mean for it to sound that way. I was just surprised, is all. Kousei: Well, alright then... if you insist. Mind if I sit beside you? Natsume: You asked that in a really creepy way... but go ahead. Kousei: (Is this what all girls smell like?) Kousei: (Crap. My thoughts are actually getting kinda creepy now. Get your mind out of the gutter, you virgin.) Kousei: ...... Kousei: ...... Kousei: ... Kousei: Ahhh! I can't stand this! Kousei: I always clam up 'cause I have no idea what the heck to talk about. Kousei: But that only makes the silence more awkward... which only makes it harder to say anything, let alone open my mouth... Natsume: I get what you're saying, but I'm not sure clamming up completely is the best approach either. Kousei: I know. You're probably thinking, \"Man, he's boring. Go away if you aren't gonna talk,\" or \"Get away from me, loser.\" Natsume: You're just being paranoid. Clamming up and giving up leaves an even worse impression, if you ask me. Kousei: You think so? Natsume: If you don't make an effort to learn how to talk to girls, you might go your whole life without ever being able to. Kousei: Well, I wouldn't want that. Kousei: I know I need to work on my social skills. Kousei: If I'm going to be working at a cafe, those will be indispensable. Kousei: I doubt I'll have to act as cheery as I had to at the pub I worked at. Natsume: It's... not going to be too much of a burden for you, is it? Kousei: Well, either way, I'm the one who decided to take the job. Kousei: Plus, it's not all bad. There are a couple of perks. Natsume: Such as? Kousei: Umm... being able to spend time with a pretty girl like you. Natsume: ...... Natsume: Pfft! What kind of answer was that? I hope you realize you're red from ear to ear. Are you stupid or something? How are you not embarrassed? Kousei: Of course I'm embarrassed. Natsume: Obviously. Kousei: I just figured most normies regularly compliment girls on their looks. Natsume: I'd say less so \"normies\" and more so \"womanizers.\" Kousei: Seriously? Well, there goes that theory... Kousei: This is all so confusing. Natsume: You sound like you might seriously be socially challenged. Kousei: I wouldn't be surprised. Natsume: Though, if you want my personal opinion, I'd take your current personality over the personalities of those loud, obnoxious chads any day. Kousei: Really? Natsume: Yeah. You're very funny, dude. Kousei: Are you ever gonna let that go?! Natsume: Sorry. Kousei: Did I fall asleep? Natsume: You conked out about three minutes into the lecture. Natsume: Though you weren't snoring, so I don't think the professor noticed. Or maybe he was just pretending not to. Kousei: Ah, good. Nhh... Nghhh! "

            "Kousei: It's a bit late, but I'm thinking of trying bookkeeping. Kousei: I'm also planning to take a few courses in business management too, though. Hiroto: Uh, wouldn't it be an easier idea to just renroll into the College of Business? Kousei: I thought about that, but I decided to just study the basics, then pick up the rest as I go along. Kousei: I think I'll learn a lot more that way, rather than just sitting in school. Hiroto: Hmm... Where are you gonna work then? Kousei: Probably... not at some big company. Kousei: I'm trying to learn a bit more about accounting and that sort of stuff at the cafe. And after that... Kousei: I'm thinking of asking my dad to teach me a few things too. Hiroto: Didn't you say your dad was a painter or something? Kousei: Yeah, but he also does some other consulting work on the side. Hiroto: Huh... Okay. Kousei: What about you? What are you planning on doing? Hiroto: Still trying to figure that out. Hiroto: I'm jealous as hell, though. You don't have to job hunt like the rest of us. Kousei: I mean, I'm basically just postponing it till later. Kousei: I pretty much still haven't decided anything about my future yet. Hiroto: Guess that's true... Hiroto: Welp, good luck in your future endeavors. Hope you earn lots of money, brother-in-law. Kousei: I'll try to, Hiroto-kun. Hiroto: ...... Kousei: ...... Hiroto & Kousei: Blllaaarrrggghhh! Hiroto: Calling you that makes me wanna puke... Kousei: Yeah, same for me. Seriously, please don't call me that ever again. Hiroto: But you ARE going out with my sister, aren't you? Kousei: Yeah. Hiroto: Well, I'm glad. By all means, take that worthless baggage off my hands. Kousei: Hey. Don't go calling my girlfriend worthless. I'll beat your ass. Hiroto: My bad. Kousei: If I wasn't serious about your sister, I wouldn't be going out with her. Hiroto: Yeah, I know. Despite all her flaws, I guess she is pretty devoted, for what it's worth. Hiroto: When she decided to become a pastry chef, she threw herself body and soul into that too. Kousei: It's that passion that got her to where she is today. Hiroto: Yeah, I guess so. Hiroto: Just try not to get yourself stabbed, alright? Kousei: I doubt that's gonna happen. Hiroto: Well, if you say so. Hiroto: But I gotta ask... What the hell do you find attractive about her? Kousei: What do you mean? Hiroto: Is it the whole \"jailbait\" thing she has going on? Kousei: No, not really. In fact, I'm actually more of a fan of big tits. Hiroto: Yet you're going out with a girl that's got none? Kousei: Yeah, well... I'm more attracted to who she is on the inside. Hiroto: I don't get it... To me, she's a total menace. Kousei: Don't say that. She can be cute too, you know. Hiroto: Her? Cute? Honestly... I just don't get your tastes, man. Suzune: Gnhrgghhh... Natsume: Order coming in. I need two plates of pancakes, one with strawberry syrup and one with chocolate syrup. Suzune: A-Alright... Natsume: Hmm? Natsume: Is something the matter? Suzune: Sorry, my chest just hurts a little... Natsume: What? That sounds serious! You should go to the hospital! Suzune: Uhh, it's not the kind of chest pain you're thinking of. Natsume: But you're still in pain, aren't you? Suzune: Yes, I am.. Suzune: These wires... are really digging into my skin... Grngh... Natsume: Come again? Natsume: Ahh... Your skin's already turning red. Suzune: How the hell does wearing a bra hurt this much... Natsume: That's just how underwire bras are, I'm afraid. Suzune: I've heard the stories, but I didn't think it'd be THIS bad. Natsume: You normally wear more comfortable ones, don't you? Suzune: Yeah. I don't really need that much support, given my cup size. Natsume: You shouldn't force yourself to wear them. If they chafe too much, you might even start bleeding. Suzune: Ngh... Natsume: Why are you grimacing? Suzune: Because of that little shit, Kousei... Do you know what he said to me the first time he saw me undress? Kousei: It's hard to see you as an adult, wearing that kind of underwear... Suzune: Can you believe that? Natsume: Yes... I actually can... Suzune: Well, anyway, I figured it couldn't hurt to wear something a little more my age. Suzune: Also, I think he's a tits kind of guy, so I thought I'd throw him a bone and try on a push-up bra. Natsume: Ah, so that's why you're wearing a wire bra. Suzune: Still... pushing them together hasn't done anything except make them look like two identical acorns. Suzune: Hey, shuddup! My nipples ain't acorns, dammit! Natsume: I didn't say that. Natsume: Nobody said a single thing about your nipples. Please stop trying to use raunchy jokes to escape from reality. Suzune: Sorry... Natsume: In any case, there are plenty of nice-looking bras out there that don't have wires in them. Suzune: Would you be willing to come help me pick? Natsume: What, you mean underwear shopping? Suzune: Yeah. I've only ever worn the most comfortable bras I could find... so I don't how to find anything else. Natsume: Ah... Well, sure. I guess I don't mind. Suzune: Really?! Thank you so much! Suzune: I'll show you who's an adult woman, Kousei. Hehehe... Just you wait. Suzune: Kousei. Kousei: Yeah? What's up? Suzune: Mind if I take a break? A bit of a long one, actually. Suzune: In fact... I might not be back until closing. Kousei: Alright. That's fine. Kousei: I imagine you have some sort of reason for doing so. Suzune: Yeah. Thanks. Suzune: Don't worry, you won't regret it. Anyway, take care of things here for me. Kousei: Can do. Kousei: \"I won't regret it\"? Natsume: Suzune-san sure is cute, isn't she? It's kind of surprising how devoted she is. Kousei: What are you talking about? Natsume: Nothing. Natsume: Anyway, I'm going to be taking a rather long break as well. Don't wait up. Kousei: Oh, okay. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Both of them are taking an extended break at the same time? Kousei: Well, whatever. Kousei: Oh, well. It's just for one day, so I don't really mind. Kousei: Still... where on earth did Suzune-san go off to? Kousei: Or maybe I should just mind my own business. Kousei: Hrmh... Honestly, the subtleties of the female mind are far beyond me. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Well, at least I'm done cleaning now. Kousei: Hm? Suzune: Oh? You're finished already? Kousei: Yeah. Suzune: Damn... Sorry. I tried to hurry back as soon I could. Kousei: It's fine. Kousei: ...... Suzune: Phew... That feels so much better. Wish I would've gone with this first. Kousei: What are you talking about? Suzune: Nothin'. Don't worry about it. Kousei: Er... by the way. You don't have to answer if you don't want to, but I'm curious. Kousei: Where exactly did you go? Suzune: Where? Do you really wanna know? Kousei: Well, yeah. Suzune: Heh... *giggle*... You little horndog. Kousei: What does that have to do with anything? Suzune: Good question... *giggle* Kousei: Did you not want me asking about it? Suzune: No, that's fine. But, hmm... Suzune: Let's see. I suppose you DO deserve a reward for holding down the fort on your own... *giggle* Suzune: Is that all you want? Kousei: Well, if you're offering me something... even more appetizing, I certainly wouldn't say no. Suzune: I knew you'd say that. You're such a little perv, you know that? Kousei: Excuse me. All I said was \"something more appetizing.\" You're the perv for immediately assuming I meant something sexual. Suzune: Oh-ho? So my assumption was wrong? Kousei: Well, no. It wasn't. Suzune: That's what I thought. *giggle* Kousei: So... are you gonna tell me what you were doing that was so important you needed to skip work for? Suzune: Hmph... Feast your eyes. Kousei: *gulp*... Suzune: *giggle*... I like that reaction. Suzune: This is a little... no, very embarrassing... but seeing you make that face makes it all worth it. Kousei: Well, your underwear is just... that cute and sexy. Suzune: Does it turn you on? Kousei: You have no idea. Hell, there's no way I wouldn't be turned on. Suzune: Looks like it... *giggle* You're hard as a rock. Kousei: I had no idea you were into this... Suzune: Actually, what I'm \"into\" is making my boyfriend happy. Kousei: Well, I'm really happy. That erotic lingerie looks amazing on you. Suzune: Oh, come on. It's not THAT erotic. Kousei: I mean, compared to the pairs you usual wear... it definitely is. Suzune: Is it, though? I don't have any boobs. Kousei: It still turns me on. Suzune: *giggle*... You perv... Kousei: I don't wanna hear that coming from someone wearing sexy underwear. Suzune: Yeah, I guess... Even I'm surprised at how dirty a girl I've become... Suzune: It's all your fault. Suzune: All your reactions are just too cute... way too cute. Kousei: Well, you say you like them. Suzune: Yeah, but, like... Actually, wait. Aren't you staring a little TOO much? Kousei: It's not my fault... I can't stop myself. Kousei: You went through the trouble of buying a pair of sexy lingerie for my sake, after all. Suzune: I told you, stop calling it that. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Just out of curiosity... What do your panties look like? Suzune: They came in a set, obviously... Do you want to see them? Kousei: Absolutely. Suzune: Geez, you really are a perv. Suzune: *giggle* I like that reaction. It's nice and honest. Kousei: What, and yours isn't? Kousei: I've been staring at you this whole time. Suzune: Well... yeah... It's been flipped a little bit, I guess. Kousei: Only a little? Suzune: Yes... Kousei: You did buy these specifically to show me... Suzune: Well, if you're that crazy about me... I guess I kinda have to. Kousei: Well, I won't deny that I'm crazy for you... Kousei: I knew you were turned on. You're ridiculously turned on. Suzune: Ugh... I can't believe I'm getting these wet on the very day I bought them. Kousei: Don't worry. Mine are just as wet. Suzune: That doesn't make me feel any better... Wait. They are? Kousei: Yep. They're sticky with cum. Suzune: Then why don't you take them off? Kousei: Huh? Suzune: I mean, you don't want them getting any more dirty, so why not just take your dick out? Suzune: Plus it's embarrassing for me to be the only one doing this... Hurry up and show me your body too. Kousei: This all is your fault, just so you know. Suzune: It's so hard... and stiff... *pant* *pant*... It's hard not to remember... Suzune: But if I take them off, how are you gonna get a good look at them? I bought them for you, remember? Kousei: Well, do you want them to get dirty? Suzune: N-No. I just bought them... It'd be a shame if they got any dirtier than they already are. Kousei: You're totally soaked. Suzune: This is... the first time I've ever gotten this wet without touching it... Kousei: Don't you normally get this wet when you touch it? Suzune: I mean... You'd know more about that than me. Kousei: I guess so. Kousei: I was just wondering if you've ever masturbated... Suzune: Why do you want to know? Kousei: Well... I kinda want to see how you do it. Suzune: How I do it? *pant* *pant*... I just do it normally, I guess... Kousei: That's my point. I don't know what \"normally\" means. Kousei: I'm a guy. Suzune: I mean, I don't know what to tell you... It's not like I masturbate THAT often... Suzune: *pant*... *pant*... *inhale*... *pant*... Kousei: ...... Suzune: *pant*... Gosh, could you not stare so much? Kousei: I'm just curious. So this is how you do it... Right there's your clit, right? Suzune: *pant* *pant*... Y-Yeah. This is the spot I usually like to touch... Nhh?! Mhh, mhh! Kousei: You really like playing with your clit, huh? Kousei: You seem like you'd enjoy fingering yourself too, though. Suzune: Mhh! Ah, ah! Nh... It doesn't feel as good... when I do it myself... *pant* *pant*... Suzune: I think I like it better when you do it instead... Nh, nhhh! Kousei: That makes me... ridiculously happy to hear. Suzune: Gosh... It's your fault I've become such a dirty girl. Kousei: That's supposed to be a compliment, right? Suzune: Yeah... Nhhh! My fingers won't stop... *pant* *pant* *pant*... *pant*... Kousei: C'mon. Let me get a better look. Suzune: Nooo... *pant* *pant*... *pant* *pant*... Kousei: You're not about to cum already, are you? Kousei: Judging my how much you're twitching, though... it looks like you are. Suzune: I don't know! I don't know, but... Suzune: Ah, ah, ahhh! This feels so good... It really turns me on, being watched while I do this... Ahhhh! Kousei: *pant*... *pant*... *pant*... Suzune: W-Wow... Your dick is so stiff it's almost touching your stomach... and it's leaking so much too... Kousei: I feel like I'm about to explode just from watching you masturbate... Suzune: You sure have a spunky dick, don't you? Kousei: Don't act like you don't love it. Suzune: Yeah, I do... I love your hard dick... Just remembering how good it felt last time is enough to make me... Ahh! Ahhhh! Kousei: That's fine. Do it. Show me how you cum. Suzune: *pant*... *pant*... So do you... Kousei: I can't hold back anymore. You'll take responsibility for making me so horny... won't you? Kousei: I'd expect a proper adult woman to. Suzune: You're right. I am an adult woman... *giggle* Suzune: Ahh! H-Hold on... You want to do it like this? Kousei: You don't? Suzune: Well, the problem is... my feet can't even touch the ground. Kousei: Don't worry. I'll support you. Kousei: I'll support you no matter what, Suzune-san. Suzune: I thought you said you wanted ME to take responsibility... I can't do anything like this. Kousei: Come on... Please? Suzune: There you go, giving me those puppy-dog eyes again... You just wanted to give this a try, didn't you? Suzune: Fine. Have it your way. Kousei: That's why I love you. Suzune: Yeah, yeah... But if I tell you it hurts, then you'd better pump the brakes, mister. Kousei: Hmm... I'll try my best. No guarantees, though. Kousei: It feels way too good inside you. My brakes might end up malfunctioning. Suzune: Why am I not surprised? In fact, it feels like you're on the verge of losing control already... Suzune: Well... that's because I already came once... Kousei: I take it you're more than ready then? Suzune: You don't need to ask. Kousei: You're right. Sorry. Kousei: This where I'm supposed to take the initiative, right? Suzune: A-Ah, ahhh! Nghhh?! Kousei: Doesn't seem like it hurt, though. Kousei: Your body's gotten so greedy. Suzune: Who's fault do you think that is? Ah, ahh, ah, ahh! Kousei: Huh? Suzune: Urk! Nhhggghhhhhh! Kousei: Ngh... You're tightening up so much... Kousei: Did you just cum again? Suzune: Ahh! *pant* *pant*... *pant*... *pant*... Kousei: All I did was put it in, you know? Suzune: I couldn't help it, okay? I'm still sensitive from cumming earlier... *pant*... *pant*... Suzune: Are you saying I wasn't cute at first? Kousei: I'm saying your cuteness has skyrocketed. You were cute at first, but now you're ridiculously cute. Kousei: I love you... so much... Suzune: Ahhh?! Kousei: It feels amazing for me too. Kousei: You're so hot and sticky... I don't think I can control myself. Suzune: You perv... Kousei: Right back at ya. Suzune: Yeah, you're right... We're both huge perverts. Kousei: Agreed. Kousei: Especially... this dirty pussy of yours. Kousei: See? Look how tightly it's gripping me. Suzune: Y-Yeah... because you're rubbing me with something so thick... Nghh! Ah?! Ah, ah?! Suzune: W-Wait, wait! You're rubbing me too much! Ahhhhhh! Kousei: That's only because you're clamping down so tightly... Nhh... Kousei: You're squeezing all my sensitive spots... Ngh... Suzune: Ahhh, ah! Ah, ah! You're hitting all my weak spots too! Ah, ah, ah! Kousei: You mean... right here? Suzune: Ahhhhhh! Yes, right there! That feels amazing! Nhhhhhhh! Kousei: You like this spot, don't you? Suzune: Ahh! Yes, yes, yes! Ah, ahhh! Oh god! I'm going crazy! Ahhhhhh! Kousei: You look so cute right now... So sexy. Suzune: *pant* *pant*... *pant*... Your dick is so hot and hard... It feels so good! Kousei: S-Suzune-san! Kousei: I'm sorry, but I can't stop... I can't stop myself anymore! Suzune: Your switch is totally flipped! Ahhhh! Nhhh, ack... Ahhhh! Kousei: I'm way past my tipping point... Your pussy feels way too good! Suzune: Ah, ah, ah, ah! Ngh... Nghh?! Kousei: I can keep grinding you like this, right? Suzune: Nhhhh! Y-Yes, keep going! Ah, ahh! Ahh! Kousei: I'll do what I can! Suzune: Nh, ahh, ahhhhhh! *pant* *pant* *pant*! I love that, I love that! Kousei: Suzune-san, Suzune-san! Suzune: *pant* *pant* Ahhh!

You're getting so big... swelling up inside me so much! Nh, ahhhh! Kousei: I can keep going, can't I? I can, right? Actually, I'm sorry--I can't stop myself anymore. Suzune: Nh, nhh! It's okay... You can cum... Just please, keep grinding... Ah, ah, ahhh! Suzune: I've never! I've never felt this good befoooore! Kousei: You're making such a dirty face... Suzune: I can't control it! Ah! Ah! Ahhhhhhhh! Suzune: No, wait! Wait! Just a little longer! Ahh! Kousei: Ngh, hngh! Kousei: Suzune-san, Suzune-san! I'm cumming! Suzune: Nhh, nghh! Me too! Ahh! Me too! I'm cumming... I'm cumming, I'm cumming, I'm cumming! Suzune: Ngh, ahhhhhhhhh! Suzune: Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh! Suzune: *pant* *pant*... Getting creampied... feels amazing... Kousei: Ngh... Your pussy's wringing me dry... Kousei: *pant*... *pant*... This seems a little uncomfortable for you, though. Kousei: I'm gonna let you down, okay? Suzune: O-Okay... But if you take it out right now... Nghh?! Kousei: S-Suzune-san, I'm cumming... I'm gonna cum, okay? Kousei: I-I'm cumming! Suzune: Ah, ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Suzune: Gosh, you cum too much... *pant*... *pant*... But it felt amazing. Kousei: It felt amazing for me too... Suzune: I can hardly stand... Kousei: Don't worry. I've got you. Suzune: Thanks... but no round two, okay? I seriously can't. Kousei: ...... Suzune: Oh, come on. Don't pretend like you cant hear me, you little perv. Suzune: Seriously, though. You got way too carried away. Kousei: Only because you were showing off your bra and panties to me. Suzune: So I take it they were to your liking? Kousei: Do you really need to ask? Suzune: I guess not. *giggle* Kousei: They got me super horny. Kousei: Almost TOO horny... After all that, my body feels kinda drained. Suzune: Well, good. If I'm being honest, though, I wanted something that would make my boobs a little bigger. Kousei: Don't worry. It would be all the same, either way. Suzune: Wow. You want an ass-beatin'? Kousei: Sorry, I didn't mean it like that. Kousei: I just meant I'm happy you went out of your way to pick these for me. That's all that matters. Suzune: Really? Kousei: Yeah. Suzune: Well, the truth is... I actually bought a couple other bras as well. Kousei: Lemme see! Suzune: Whoa, whoa. I thought you said you were already drained? Kousei: I'm not saying we have to do it today. Kousei: We'll have plenty of opportunities in the future to put them to good use. Suzune: Yeah, you're right. Suzune: After all, you promised you'd continue supporting me forever, didn't you? Kousei: That I did. Suzune: Perfect! I'm gonna hold you that. "

            "Kousei: Wh-What? Are you angry or something? Natsume: Not really... Kousei: Y-You sure? Well, if you say so. Kousei: Hey, uh, isn't it about time you started calling me by my first name? Kousei: We're in a relationship now, and it's not like we're strangers anymore, especially after what we just did. Natsume: Wait, or was it because you wanted to become more of a chad? Kousei: Ahh, right. Kousei: Yeah, those were definitely regrets that I had. But only now that I've experienced it do I understand what it was I really wanted. Kousei: I wanted to fall in love, be together with that person... and experience things I'd never experienced before. It was never really about wanting to have sex, specifically. Kousei: Honestly, I think I found what I was looking for the moment you agreed to be my girlfriend, Natsume. Natsume: Oh. Well, if you're satisfied already... Natsume: Then I won't have sex with you anymore. Kousei: What?! Why?! Natsume: Well, you know... Kousei: Was it that--well, of course it was painful... but was it really that bad? Kousei: I didn't hurt you, did I? I-If I did, I'm sorry! It was my first time, so I went a little... actually, a lot overboard. Kousei: I just got so excited because I love you so much that I couldn't help myself and-- Natsume: ...it... Kousei: Huh? Natsume: No... That's not what I meant... Kousei: You're not mad because of how rough I was? Natsume: Not really. I don't think you were too rough. Kousei: Oh, well that's a relief. But then why don't you wanna do it with me anymore? Kousei: Did you not enjoy it? Natsume: I did. Kousei: Then why? Kousei: Can you at least tell me that? Natsume: Because... Natsume: It felt... good. Kousei: I'm sorry? Natsume: It felt good, okay? Way too good--so good that I felt like I was going crazy! Kousei: Oof. Kousei: What's wrong with that? Natsume: I just... don't like it. The way I lose control of myself, and say all those embarrassing things... Kousei: Uhh... Yeah, I guess I can see where you're coming from. Kousei: But if you ask me, you were incredibly adorable. Natsume: Still, it's too embarrassing for me. I don't want you seeing me like that, so... I don't want to do it anymore. Kousei: ...... Natsume: What are you smirking about? Kousei: I dunno, to be honest. But I'm really happy for some reason. Kousei: What? No! No, I'm not! Not at all! Natsume: ...... Natsume: Are you only with me for sex? Kousei: Of course not. Kousei: But I'm a young man with a healthy sex drive, so, you know... Kousei: Maybe you're just not used to it? That might be why it feels like you're going crazy... Kousei: Once you get used to the stimulation, though, I'm sure you'll be able to keep yourself under control. Natsume: Well-- Natsume: Honestly, it feels like you're trying to trick me. Kousei: Would it hurt to give it a try? Natsume: Um... W-Wait, why are you getting closer? Kousei: Well, I can't touch you from over here, can I? Natsume: What? But you just ejaculated a minute ago. I thought it was over, once guys... you know, finished. Kousei: Normally, maybe. Kousei: But after what you just told me, I'm ready to go again. Kousei: Don't worry. I'll hold on to you tight. You won't fall over. Natsume: That's not the problem here-- Kousei: I want to keep having sex with you, Natsume. Kousei: Not just because it feels good, but because all five of my senses yearn for you. Kousei: I love you with every fiber of my being. Kousei: So, please... Natsume: Ah! Ngh...

Kousei: If you're really that interested, I don't mind making it for you. You'll probably have to wait until tomorrow to drink it, though. Mei: Are you sure? Kousei: It's not a big deal, really. Like I said, it's pretty much just soaking the beans in water. Mei: You wouldn't mind making me some then? I really wanna try it! Kousei: Alright. I'll get started on it. Mei: Woohoo! I can't wait! You'd better not forget, Senpai! Kousei: I'll try not to. But if I do, I apologize in advance... Mei: Bleh. Fine, then let's make a promise right now. Kousei: With ice? Mei: Nope. Hot. Kousei: Oof, that's pretty brutal. My nostrils would burn. Mei: Then you'd better not break our promise, Senpai. Kousei: Alright, alright. I'll do my best to remember. Kousei: But if I do forget... I'll weep tears of coffee for you. Mei: Black tears, eh? I kinda want to see that. Mei: On second thought, you can go ahead and break our promise. Kousei: Huh. I didn't peg you for a sadist, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Hey, you're the one who added that last part, Senpai. Not me. Kousei: Well, a promise is a promise. I'll bring you a nice cup of cold-brew tomorrow. Mei: Thank ya kindly! Suzune: You sure? Well, alright then. Suzune: Ah--but if you need any help, come let me know. Kousei: I will. Thanks. Kousei: But it is Sunday, so this might be it for today... Natsume: Order coming in. Two plates of pancakes. Kousei: Sure. I'll get those done. Natsume: It's just you in here? Where's Suzune-san? Kousei: She's taking her break right now. Kousei: Pancakes ready! Natsume: Thanks. I'll bring them out. Kousei: Were you watching me the whole time? Kousei: Relax, I'm a Suzune-certified pancake chef now. Kousei: Show a little trust in me, will you? Natsume: ...... Natsume: *sigh*... Kousei: Why the sigh? Natsume: Because I'm exasperated. Kousei: Yeah, but why? Natsume: Sorry, but I need to take these out. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Pardon me? Kousei: Nope. Natsume: Good. Alright, let's get going. Kousei: ...... Kousei: So, uhh, is this a date? Natsume: No, nothing like that. Kousei: A toast to what? Natsume: To the cafe finally opening, I guess. Or to getting off to such a good start. Something like that. Kousei: You don't sound too enthused. Natsume: Well, you know, we're also bound to be a lot busier from now on. Natsume: So here's to a bright future of non-stop work and unpaid overtime. Kousei: Not sure I want to toast to that at all. Natsume: Oh, lighten up. C'mon, cheers. Kousei: Cheers. Natsume: I'm not sure. Probably, if I had to say. I'm not very good with cocktails that have a high alcohol percentage. Natsume: What about you? Kousei: Average, I guess. I'm not a heavy drinker by any means, but I can hold my liquor decently--I think. Kousei: I've only ever gone drinking with certain people I know, so I've never gotten blackout drunk. I'm not sure how high my tolerance goes. Natsume: Oh. Ah--I'll take a Valencia, please. Kousei: ...... Kousei: I've never been to a high-class bar before. Kousei: It seems, err... a little expensive. Kousei: I'd feel bad making you pay for me. Natsume: I'm the one who invited you here, aren't I? It's fine. Kousei: Still, I--wait, I don't think I ever asked. Why DID you invite me here? Kousei: Are you trying to get me drunk?! Natsume: If anyone should be worrying about that, it's me. Bartender: Here you are, miss. Kousei: Why not invite everyone else then? Natsume: ...... Natsume: Because I want to show you that I trust you... Kousei: Huh? Natsume: Do you not remember what you said in the kitchen earlier? Kousei: ...... Kousei: Ohh, when Suzune-san was taking her break. Natsume: You've done a lot for me, Takamine-kun. If it weren't for you, we wouldn't have found the success that we have. Natsume: You convinced both Sumizome-san to work for us and Suzune-san to bake for us. Natsume: I'm grateful. And I do trust you. I just wanted you to know that. Kousei: Oh, okay. Natsume: I thought it'd sound more sincere to tell you over some drinks, rather than at work. Natsume: Even though I know this isn't my style. Natsume: They're pretty low in alcohol, so I can handle it. Kousei: Well, anyway... thanks for saying all that. Kousei: People rarely ever thank me directly, so I appreciate it. Natsume: Oh. Well, I'm glad I invited you out then. Ah--I'd like another cocktail, please. Something with pineapple. Kousei: I'll have a highball. Something easy to drink. Kousei: Do you drink often, Shiki-san? Natsume: Once in a while. At first, I was only really interested in seeing what alcohol tasted like. Natsume: I don't drink at home, but I do visit this place from time to time. The atmosphere in here makes it easy to drink alone. Kousei: So do you usually come here to celebrate? Natsume: Yeah. Bartender: Here you are, miss. Kousei: Out of curiosity, do you drink beer? Natsume: Urk... No. Kousei: Too bitter for you? Kousei: Not at all. Sweet cocktails taste great too. Kousei: Here, let's do another toast. Cheers. Natsume: Cheers. Natsume: Hey, Takamine-kun. Kousei: Yeah? Natsume: It's... past time for the last train. Kousei: What, you're calling it quits already? The night's still young! Kousei: First of all, it's not even eleven o'clock yet. The trains have to still be running. Natsume: Pfft. I know. Kousei: Where do you even live anyway? Is it far from here? Natsume: It's less than a ten minute walk from here. Kousei: Then why'd you even mention the last train? Natsume: I just thought it'd get you all hot and bothered. Natsume: Did it work? Kousei: You're drunk, aren't you? Natsume: I am no--Hggrk! Kousei: Are you feeling sick? About to puke? Do you need to go to the bathroom? Natsume: Got you! I feel completely fine. In fact, I'm feeling a pretty good buzz right about now. *giggle*! Kousei: That's not much different. Natsume: I'm not going to puke. And I won't get a hangover either, so don't worry about me. Natsume: I just wanted to try saying one of those cliche pick-up lines about the last train and whatnot. Kousei: You sure you haven't had too much to drink? Natsume: Well, maybe a little. I might've paced myself too quickly. Sorry. Kousei: Guess we better call it a night soon. Natsume: Umm... Natsume: I don't want to go home today. Kousei: Sh-Shiki-san... Kousei: You're just going to wait till midnight, then say \"Welp, it's not 'today' anymore!\" aren't you? Natsume: Wow, what a party-pooper. Saw right through me. Kousei: I've got class early tomorrow anyway. Plus I gotta bake cakes before that. Kousei: Excuse me, sir, could we get the bill? Oh, and a glass of water for her. Natsume: I don't need water. I'm fiiine. Kousei: Want me to walk you home? Natsume: Thanks, but I'll be alright. Kousei: Come on, just let me? Letting a girl walk home alone at night is rude. Natsume: Pretending to be nice so you can push your way up to my room, eh? Natsume: Officer, help! Kousei: Wha--?! Keep your voice down! I haven't even done anything yet! Kousei: Wait--I didn't mean \"yet\" as in I was planning to, okay?! Anyway, stop making a scene! Natsume: Relax, I'm just kidding. Kousei: You said you trusted me, no? Kousei: Or do you not trust me enough to bring you home? Natsume: That has nothing to do with this. Natsume: How dare you use my own words against me. That's cheap. Natsume: *sigh*... Fine. I'll let you walk me home. Natsume: That's where I live. Natsume: After all that fuss you made, I thought for sure you were going to try and come up to my room. Kousei: I wouldn't want to betray your trust. Natsume: Well, not that I'd ever let you in. Kousei: I figured. Natsume: If I invited a guy into my room, I'd pretty much be asking for it, no? Kousei: No, not-- Kousei: Okay, I guess you are kind of right. Natsume: Exactly. Natsume: See you tomorrow. Kousei: Mhm. Night. Kousei: Pheeeeew... My heart's pounding like crazy. Kousei: I know she was only teasing me, but still... Kousei: I was trying my damnedest to play it cool. I hope she bought it. Kousei: Crap! I gotta get changed quick! Kousei: Good morning. Suzune: Oh, there you are. Managed to make it on time, eh? Kousei: Yeah, thankfully. Suzune: Well, good morning to you. Now let's get to work. Kousei: Since it's a weekday, how many cakes are we making? Suzune: I wrote all that info down. See for yourself. Kousei: Hmm. That's definitely a lot fewer than last time. Are you sure that'll be enough? Suzune: I know it seems pessimistic, but let me explain. Suzune: Even the most popular bakeries only have about half the number of customers on weekdays compared to weekends. Suzune: So reducing our quota's only the smart thing to do. Kousei: Huh. I didn't know that. Suzune: Ready to get started? Kousei: Yep. Kousei: Oh, look at the time. Kousei: Sorry. I gotta go soon. Suzune: Hm? Oh, right, you have class. Alright. We should be good to go. Thanks for the help. Kousei: No problem. I'll see you later today. Suzune: Sure. See you then. Kousei: Hey... Acquaintance A: Hey. What's up with you, man? You look kinda tired. Kousei: Yeah. I have to get up pretty early for my new part-time job, see. Acquaintance A: My condolences. "

Kousei: Err, not quite... Kousei: I was just wandering around, looking for somewhere to eat. Mei: I don't blame you for wanting to take a break from cooking for once. It is New Year's Eve. Kousei: Yeah. Too bad most restaurants are closed, though. Kousei: But those bags look pretty heavy. Do you need a hand? Mei: Oh, no. I'm fine. My house isn't too far from here. Mei: What about you, Senpai? Aren't you planning to visit your family too? Kousei: The only family I've really got is my dad, and he's overseas. Kousei: Ah?! Mei: I heard she had to go back home because of some family matters, and apparently, she doesn't know when she'll be back. Kousei: Where'd you hear that? Mei: Mikado-san told me. Kousei: Oh. Mei: H-Huh? What is it? Was there some kind of serious accident or something? Kousei: No, nothing like that... but whatever it was, it was pretty sudden. Mei: Yeah. I hope she comes back soon. Kousei: Yeah... me too. Mei: She still hadn't finished teaching me how to brew coffee. Kousei: Coffee? Mei: For a while now, her coffee has been getting quite a reputation for its flavor, you see. Kousei: Oh. Now that you mention it... Mei: I can make a cup of coffee the way I learned before... but there's just something missing when I do it. Mei: Maybe it's just because I don't like bitter drinks. But that's why I've been practicing with Kanna-san's advice. Kousei: I can't wait. Mei: Anyway, I'd better get going. Have a happy new year, Senpai! Kousei: You too. Kousei: ...... Natsume: Ah. Kousei: Shiki-san. Out shopping? Natsume: Yeah... I'd ask how you're doing, but I think I already know the answer to that. Kousei: I guess that means you already know what happened to Kanna? Natsume: His Excellency told me that she'd gone on to be reincarnated. Kousei: Yeah. Natsume: What's on your mind, Takamine-kun? Kousei: Hmm. Kousei: I was just thinking about what kind of coffee beans to buy. Natsume: Coffee, huh? Natsume: I still can't say I understand the appeal. Any way you look at it, no one needs bitter coffee. Kousei: You don't like bell peppers either, do you? Natsume: Oh, shut up. Kousei: Out of curiosity, what kind of coffee beans do you think I should buy, Shiki-san? Natsume: Why are you asking me? I can't drink coffee unless I add enough milk and sugar to drown out the flavor. Kousei: I dunno. That's just the way the conversation was going. Natsume: What's the best-tasting coffee bean you've had up until now? Kousei: Hmm... Blue Mountain, I guess. Natsume: Oh, the really expensive one. Kousei: There's really nothing else like it. Kousei: You know what? It might be expensive, but it doesn't hurt to indulge every once in a while. Natsume: Maybe I should splurge a little and buy myself some expensive tea leaves too. Landlady: Oh, my! If it isn't Natsume-chan. Natsume: Oh! Hello, ma'am. Landlady: It's nice to see you. Oh, my. On a date, are you? Is this your boyfriend? Natsume: Absolutely not. Landlady: No? Ah, wait a moment. I remember you... Kousei: Hello. I work at Cafe Stella too. Shiki-san and I are coworkers. Landlady: Ah, of course. You're the one who works in the kitchen. Kousei: Thank you for your continued patronage. Landlady: It's my pleasure. Thank you for always making such delicious food. Kousei: My pleasure. Landlady: Not that we ever had customers lining up outside our door back then. *giggle* Landlady: I'm sorry I didn't have more faith in you from the start. Natsume: Don't be. It's only because you were reluctant to rent out the cafe to us that we all tried our hardest to change your mind. Natsume: If you'd rented it out to us without a second thought, I don't think we'd be nearly as popular with customers as we are now. Landlady: That's very kind of you to say. Landlady: But your food truly is delicious. Not only do you serve a wonderful cup of tea, but lately, I get the feeling the taste of your coffee has improved even more. Landlady: I'll be visiting you all next year as well. Natsume: Of course. We'll be waiting for you. Landlady: Well then, I'd best be going. I'd hate to interrupt your date any longer. Natsume: I told you we're not dating. Landlady: *giggle* Have a happy new year, you two. Natsume & Kousei: You too. Kousei: ...... Kousei: The landlady might be rather let down next year... when she realizes Kanna isn't here anymore. Kousei: You're right. If the cafe were to go out of business the minute she left, I'd never be able to face her again. Kousei: Besides, I've got to keep my promise to her. Natsume: What promise? Kousei: I promised her I'd keep on smiling. Natsume: Ah. Kousei: It's a pretty hard promise to keep... but we can't just let these butterflies roam free, can we? Kousei: Anyway, you don't have to worry about me, Shiki-san. Natsume: Alright. Still, if you ever need my help, just let me know. Kousei: Thanks. I will. Nozomi: Hm? Ah, Kousei-kun! Kousei: Oh? Didn't expect to see you here too, Suzune-san. Suzune: 'Sup. Kousei: What are you doing here? Suzune: I came to offer the gods a quick prayer before going back to my parents' house. Then I bumped into Nozomi-san here. Nozomi: What about you, Kousei-kun? What are you doing here? Kousei: It'd be a pain in the ass to visit the shrine later on if I want to spend my New Year's chilling, so I thought I'd drop by now since I was already out. Kousei: Is it weird, visiting in the middle of the day on New Year's Eve? Nozomi: Not at all. New Year's Eve is when we give thanks for the previous year. And the new year is when we pray for the year to come. That's all that matters. Kousei: I see. Nozomi: Oh, but don't forget to toss some cash into the offering box. Kousei: Trying to guilt me into making a donation, huh? That's not very shrine maiden-like. Nozomi: Well, I'm only a part-time shrine maiden. Ehehe. Nozomi: If you want, you're welcome to try on my outfit too, Suzune-san. Suzune: No, thanks. I'm not falling for that one. I've already decided I'm not working on New Year's. Nozomi: Aww. Well, it was worth a shot... Suzune: The holidays are all about lazing around under the kotatsu for me. Kousei: I'd have to agree. Nozomi: I don't think you should be lazing around too much, though, Kousei-kun. Kousei: Come on, it's New Year's. Besides, I've been getting up so early for work lately. It's not like I'm leading an unhealthy lifestyle. Nozomi: I know, but you've got a girlfriend now. Kousei: Kanna isn't... Nozomi: Oh, wait. She had to go home because of some family matters, didn't she? Suzune: Oh, that's right... Guess that means you're going to be by yourself for New Year's. Kousei: Yeah, probably. Suzune: That's a shame. On New Year's, of all days. Kousei: Well, it is what it is. Kousei: It would've been too selfish of me to ask her to stay. Nozomi: Well, I hope she comes back soon. Nozomi: We should totally have a New Year's party when she does! Kousei: A New Year's party? Nozomi: Yeah, like that time we all had yakiniku together! That was really fun. Kousei: Yeah. It really was. Kousei: It sure would be nice to do that again... if everyone had the time. Kousei: But even I don't know when Kanna will be back, so... Suzune: Hmm... Maybe we could all go cherry-blossom viewing? That's still a ways off, though. Nozomi: Oh, that's a great idea! Kousei: We can just have a New Year's party with those who can make it, though. Nozomi: Don't be silly. Parties are meant to be celebrated with everyone. Suzune: Yeah. What she said. Nozomi: You too! Happy New Year! Kousei: Happy New Year. Kousei: I don't want to keep you for too long either, so I'll just say my prayers then go home. Nozomi: You'd better be eating properly, you hear? If you feel too lazy to cook, I can bring you some osechi later. Kousei: Nah, that's okay. You don't need to do that. Kousei: You're gonna have your hands full helping out at the shrine for the next few days, aren't you? If I really have nothing to eat, I'll give you a call and come over instead. Nozomi: Well, alright. Kousei: You sure have it tough, though. Kousei: Normally you have to work part-time at the cafe, and now you have to help out at the shrine for New Year's. Nozomi: That's just how it is. I've accepted it as my fate for being born a Shinto priest's daughter. Still, it's not like I don't want to help at all. Nozomi: And besides, working at the cafe is fun. I doesn't feel much like a job to me. Kousei: You're always a huge help to everyone, Nozomi. In a lot of ways. Kousei: Thanks for everything you do. Nozomi: Someone's awfully honest today... You didn't eat some weird garbage off the ground, did you? Kousei: Well, it's New Year's Eve. Kousei: You're pretty much like a guardian deity to me, so I'm expressing my gratitude to you for the past year. Thank you. Nozomi: You're free to thank me any other day of the year as well, you know. Kousei: C'mon. I'm trying to be sincere here. Nozomi: Well, your delivery needs some work. Nozomi: I appreciate your gratitude, but you don't need to make up some weird excuse to say thank you. I'm sure you'd make Mom and Dad happier that way too. Kousei: Yeah, you're right. I'll stop by and say hello to them before I leave. "

Kousei: Err, not quite... Kousei: I was just wandering around, looking for somewhere to eat. Mei: I don't blame you for wanting to take a break from cooking for once. It is New Year's Eve. Kousei: Yeah. Too bad most restaurants are closed, though. Kousei: But those bags look pretty heavy. Do you need a hand? Mei: Oh, no. I'm fine. My house isn't too far from here. Mei: What about you, Senpai? Aren't you planning to visit your family too? Kousei: The only family I've really got is my dad, and he's overseas. Kousei: Ah?! Mei: I heard she had to go back home because of some family matters, and apparently, she doesn't know when she'll be back. Kousei: Where'd you hear that? Mei: Mikado-san told me. Kousei: Oh. Mei: H-Huh? What is it? Was there some kind of serious accident or something? Kousei: No, nothing like that... but whatever it was, it was pretty sudden. Mei: Yeah. I hope she comes back soon. Kousei: Yeah... me too. Mei: She still hadn't finished teaching me how to brew coffee. Kousei: Coffee? Mei: For a while now, her coffee has been getting quite a reputation for its flavor, you see. Kousei: Oh. Now that you mention it... Mei: I can make a cup of coffee the way I learned before... but there's just something missing when I do it. Mei: Maybe it's just because I don't like bitter drinks. But that's why I've been practicing with Kanna-san's advice. Kousei: I can't wait. Mei: Anyway, I'd better get going. Have a happy new year, Senpai! Kousei: You too. Kousei: ...... Natsume: Ah. Kousei: Shiki-san. Out shopping? Natsume: Yeah... I'd ask how you're doing, but I think I already know the answer to that. Kousei: I guess that means you already know what happened to Kanna? Natsume: His Excellency told me that she'd gone on to be reincarnated. Kousei: Yeah. Natsume: What's on your mind, Takamine-kun? Kousei: Hmm. Kousei: I was just thinking about what kind of coffee beans to buy. Natsume: Coffee, huh? Natsume: I still can't say I understand the appeal. Any way you look at it, no one needs bitter coffee. Kousei: You don't like bell peppers either, do you? Natsume: Oh, shut up. Kousei: Out of curiosity, what kind of coffee beans do you think I should buy, Shiki-san? Natsume: Why are you asking me? I can't drink coffee unless I add enough milk and sugar to drown out the flavor. Kousei: I dunno. That's just the way the conversation was going. Natsume: What's the best-tasting coffee bean you've had up until now? Kousei: Hmm... Blue Mountain, I guess. Natsume: Oh, the really expensive one. Kousei: There's really nothing else like it. Kousei: You know what? It might be expensive, but it doesn't hurt to indulge every once in a while. Natsume: Maybe I should splurge a little and buy myself some expensive tea leaves too. Landlady: Oh, my! If it isn't Natsume-chan. Natsume: Oh! Hello, ma'am. Landlady: It's nice to see you. Oh, my. On a date, are you? Is this your boyfriend? Natsume: Absolutely not. Landlady: No? Ah, wait a moment. I remember you... Kousei: Hello. I work at Cafe Stella too. Shiki-san and I are coworkers. Landlady: Ah, of course. You're the one who works in the kitchen. Kousei: Thank you for your continued patronage. Landlady: It's my pleasure. Thank you for always making such delicious food. Kousei: My pleasure. Landlady: Not that we ever had customers lining up outside our door back then. *giggle* Landlady: I'm sorry I didn't have more faith in you from the start. Natsume: Don't be. It's only because you were reluctant to rent out the cafe to us that we all tried our hardest to change your mind. Natsume: If you'd rented it out to us without a second thought, I don't think we'd be nearly as popular with customers as we are now. Landlady: That's very kind of you to say. Landlady: But your food truly is delicious. Not only do you serve a wonderful cup of tea, but lately, I get the feeling the taste of your coffee has improved even more. Landlady: I'll be visiting you all next year as well. Natsume: Of course. We'll be waiting for you. Landlady: Well then, I'd best be going. I'd hate to interrupt your date any longer. Natsume: I told you we're not dating. Landlady: *giggle* Have a happy new year, you two. Natsume & Kousei: You too. Kousei: ...... Kousei: The landlady might be rather let down next year... when she realizes Kanna isn't here anymore. Kousei: You're right. If the cafe were to go out of business the minute she left, I'd never be able to face her again. Kousei: Besides, I've got to keep my promise to her. Natsume: What promise? Kousei: I promised her I'd keep on smiling. Natsume: Ah. Kousei: It's a pretty hard promise to keep... but we can't just let these butterflies roam free, can we? Kousei: Anyway, you don't have to worry about me, Shiki-san. Natsume: Alright. Still, if you ever need my help, just let me know. Kousei: Thanks. I will. Nozomi: Hm? Ah, Kousei-kun! Kousei: Oh? Didn't expect to see you here too, Suzune-san. Suzune: 'Sup. Kousei: What are you doing here? Suzune: I came to offer the gods a quick prayer before going back to my parents' house. Then I bumped into Nozomi-san here. Nozomi: What about you, Kousei-kun? What are you doing here?

I thought you enjoyed the reunion. Natsume: I did. Natsume: It was a relief to find out I wasn't the only one, honestly... After all these years, it feels like a weight's been lifted off my chest. Natsume: So thank you. Kousei: Glad I could help. Natsume: But that still doesn't mean I forgive you for surprising me. Kousei: I thought not. Natsume: I wish you would've just told me you were planning this from the start. Kousei: I did consider it, of course. Kousei: But if I did that, I feel like you would've chickened out. Natsume: Ngh... I guess I can't deny that. Natsume: Actually, come to think of it, didn't you say there were two more people coming to the reunion? Kousei: Well, now that you mention it... Natsume: This better not be another surprise. Kousei: Wait. I really don't know what's happening this time. Kousei: They said they were going to come, I swear. Natsume: Just who else did you invite? Kousei: Err-- Natsume's Father: Natsume. Natsume: Dad? Mom? Natsume's Mother: Hi! Natsume: Don't tell me they were who you were referring to... Natsume's Mother: We were watching you the whole time. Seeing you work, chatting happily with your friends. Natsume's Mother: You looked like you were having so much fun, though, so we didn't want to interrupt. Natsume: ...... Natsume's Father: You had the biggest smile on your face, Natsume. Natsume: I-I was just-- Natsume's Father: It feels like it's been a while since we've seen you smile so brightly. Natsume's Father: Somewhere along the way, we started seeing less and less of that beautiful smile of yours. Natsume's Mother: As you've gotten older, all you've been doing is apologize to us. Natsume: I guess... Kousei: Sorry, I hate to interrupt. Kousei: But why don't we move this conversation inside? No reason to stand around out here. Natsume's Father: Yes, let's do that. Natsume's Mother: I'd love to try some of your tea, Natsume! Natsume: Here is your Darjeeling tea. Natsume's Mother: Thank you. Natsume's Father: Now then, let's give this a try. Natsume: Huh? Wh-What is it? Did I get something wrong? Natsume's Mother: Oh, not at all, dear. Just the opposite, in fact. This is delicious. Natsume's Father: Such wonderful flavor and aroma. This tastes wonderful. Much better than anything I could ever make, at least. You did an amazing job. Natsume: That's ridiculous. You're the one who taught me everything I know, Dad. Natsume's Father: All I taught you were the basics. Natsume's Father: But the tea you're making now goes way beyond \"basic.\" Natsume's Father: You know, when the landlady first told us what you were doing, we had half a mind to stop you... but I feel silly for worrying now. Natsume's Mother: Absolutely. Natsume's Father: Listen, Natsume. There's something we've been meaning to say to you. Natsume's Mother: About this cafe. Natsume: Y-Yes? Natsume's Mother: I'll be blunt. Have you been under the impression that it's your fault that your father and I gave up on the cafe? Natsume: I mean, that's the truth, isn't it? Natsume's Father: It wasn't you. Natsume: But it had to be... Natsume's Father: Sure, we did have to put our plans of opening a cafe on hold. Natsume's Father: But that had nothing to do with your your health, Natsume. Natsume's Mother: Our dream was to quit the white-collar working life and open our own cafe. Natsume's Mother: In fact, we were more than ready to do so. Natsume's Father: But then all of a sudden, the global financial crisis hit. Natsume: Ah... I guess the timing does line up. Natsume's Mother: In other words, given our finances, we just decided it wasn't a very good time to start a new business. Natsume's Mother: Whether you were hospitalized or not, we would have given up on it either way. Natsume's Father: So because of that, we stayed at our jobs. But after a while, our minds began to clear. Natsume's Father: We realized that, truth be told, there wasn't any real need to rush into this cafe thing. Natsume's Mother: Exactly. We decided that we'd take it slow and save up more money. Nothing said we couldn't open the cafe after we retire. Natsume's Father: What we're trying to say is--while it was something we always wanted to do, it was also something we could give up on without hesitation. Natsume's Father: So you have nothing to blame yourself for, Natsume. Besides, we've never regretted our decision at all. Natsume's Mother: If anything, we might've actually regretted opening the cafe back then, instead of giving it more thought. Natsume's Father: Looking back, I'm honestly relieved we didn't act on the spur of the moment. Natsume: Oh... you are? Natsume: I never realized... Natsume: ...... Natsume: *sigh* Great... Then I guess this was all pointless, in the end. Just what have I been doing? Natsume's Father: How is this pointless? You've been working hard to make this dream of yours a reality, haven't you? Natsume: No, you don't understand. This cafe-- Natsume's Father: Is your dream, Natsume. You didn't do all of this for our sake. Natsume's Father: I can tell from the taste of your tea. You've put your heart and soul into this. Natsume's Mother: We understand better than anyone how tough it is running a cafe. Natsume's Mother: If this weren't really your dream, you wouldn't be working this hard. Natsume's Mother: Besides, didn't you see how much fun your guests were having today? Natsume: That's only because... they were my friends. Natsume's Father: Your regular customers enjoy themselves just as much, don't they? Natsume's Mother: Well, of course they do. Otherwise this place wouldn't be so bustling all the time. Natsume: Huh? Wait a second. Have you two been here before? Natsume's Father: Well, of course we have. Although, this is the first time we've ever actually come inside. Natsume's Mother: We were worried about you, so we came to see how you were doing, but one peek was all we needed. Natsume's Father: You were smiling so happily while you worked. Natsume: ...... Natsume's Mother: Opening this cafe may have been our dream, at first. Natsume's Mother: But now, it's yours. Natsume's Father: You made this a reality. Natsume's Father: You're amazing. Honestly, the truth is--we were afraid. That's why we were able to give up on it so easily. Natsume's Mother: While the recession was definitely a factor, in retrospect, we only used it as an excuse. Natsume's Father: But through your own hard work, you've turned this place into the best cafe ever, Natsume. Natsume: I... didn't really... Natsume's Father: As your parents, we couldn't be more proud of what you've achieved. In fact, we even admire you. Natsume's Mother: You worked hard, Natsume. Natsume: I didn't do it on my own, though... Natsume's Father: Maybe, but you managed to succeed at something we never could. Have some more confidence in yourself. Natsume's Father: And please, stop thinking that you need to atone for anything. Natsume's Father: You should be enjoying yourself more, working here. Like you were today. Natsume's Mother: We much prefer seeing you smile, after all. Natsume's Father: And we really are incredibly proud of you. Natsume's Mother: We're couldn't be more glad to have you as our daughter, Natsume. From the bottom of our hearts-- Natsume's Father & Mother: We love you. Natsume: ...... Natsume: Yeah... I know. Natsume: I love you too. Natsume: So? Natsume: How exactly are you going to compensate me for today? Kousei: Well, I'll let you cry into my chest if you want. Natsume: I'm not crying. Kousei: You sure? Looked like you were on the verge of tears earlier. Natsume: Shut up, and give me my compensation already. Kousei: ...... Kousei: I'm sorry. I'm sorry for keeping this a secret from you. I apologize. Please forgive me. Natsume: If you want me to forgive you, then close your eyes. And grit your teeth. Kousei: Okay. Natsume: I can't stay mad at you, after everything that happened. Even if you DID surprise me. Kousei: So you're not breaking up with me, after all? Natsume: I'll let you off the hook. This time. Kousei: Phew. I appreciate it. Natsume: Thank you for today. Really, I mean it. Natsume: I feel a weight's been lifted off my shoulders. Natsume: Knowing that everyone remembered the time we shared together, all those meaningless chats we had when we were kids... It feels good. Kousei: Looks like you weren't so insignificant to them after all. Natsume: I guess not. Kousei: So no more of that self-deprecation, alright? You'll make your parents sad too. Natsume: Yeah, I know. Natsume: Well, at least, now I do. Today, for the first time in my life, I learned just how much my mom and dad care about me. Natsume: Somewhere along the way... I started to think that it would have been better if someone else, someone healthier, had been born instead of me. Natsume: That's why I was always prepared to hear my parents say that about me. Kousei: But that wasn't the case. Natsume: They really do love me, don't they? Kousei: More than you know. Natsume: I thought I was prepared for anything they might say to me. Natsume: But this was... something I wasn't expecting at all. Natsume: Hearing how important I am to them made me really, really happy. Natsume: Yeah. I think it's the fragment of my soul that parted from me... Kousei: You're welcome. Natsume: Thank you for falling in love with me. Natsume: And thank you for being my boyfriend. Kousei: Does this mean I was able become a boyfriend you can be proud of? Natsume: Well, I don't know if I'd go THAT far. Kousei: Is it because of the surprises? Natsume: No. Because other women will start flirting with you if I start bragging about how great you are. Kousei: ...... Kousei: I'll take that as a compliment, I guess. Natsume: It was. Kousei: Ah. Kousei: Well, that's fine. As long as you're happy with me. Natsume: I am. Natsume: To be honest, I've fallen for you all over again. So from now on, I'm going to make sure that I'm the only woman who satisfies you. Kousei: You mean... sexually? Natsume: Well, in that sense too, I suppose. Kousei: ...... Natsume: What? Is that not what you want? Kousei: Oh, no, it is. Just busy imagining all the ways I'll have you \"satisfy\" me later. Natsume: *giggle* You're such an idiot. Natsume: But idiot or not, I still love you. "

I recognized you the moment I saw you! Kirigaya?: Hah! Says the guy who thought my name was \"Kirigaya\"! Man 1: I didn't forget your name, man. I just misspoke. Natsume: Wait... Ooyama-kun... and Kinugasa-kun? Ooyami: Yep, that's us! Kinugasa: Long time no see. Woman 1: Hey there, Natsume-chan! Woman 2: Wow, you're right! She's so pretty!

I feel light as a feather today. Nozomi: Sleep really IS important, huh? Nozomi: My own body feels totally different from usual. In fact, it almost feels a little weird. Nozomi: Alrighty then.

Don't tell me you gave into your lust and violated her?! Mei: Oh God... Mei: Ahhh! Mei: Senpai, y-y-y-you animal! Natsume: Ugh. What a scumbag.

Natsume: It didn't sound like she was in danger or anything... I wonder what happened? Kousei: I'd better go check it out. Natsume: Hold it. Where do you think you're going? Sumizome-san's in the middle of changing right now. Are you trying to peep on her, you damned pervert? Mei: Senpai... To think I trusted you! Kousei: Ouch... It's hard to tell if you're serious. Kousei: I'm kidding, alright? You guys can go check on her. I'm going back to the kitchen. Kanna: Come on. Let's go see if she's okay. Mei: R-Right! Mei: Nozomi-chan, what happened?! Are you hurt?! Nozomi: Huh?! Oh, no, I'm fine! It's... It's nothing. Natsume: Looks like you've finished changing without issue. Kanna: But then what was that scream about? Nozomi: Sorry! I got a little spooked, that's all. My, um, my backpack suddenly fell onto the floor, you see! Kanna: Oh, did it? Natsume: Well, I'm glad there's no emergency. Nozomi: Of course there's no emergency! Aha! Ahaha! Nozomi: (Th-This is way too embarrassing to say. I can't... I can't believe...) Nozomi: (I can't believe I forgot to wear a bra today!) Nozomi: (No WONDER my body feels so light! I wasn't wearing a bra! I was going commando! THAT'S why something seemed off!) Nozomi: (That's what I get for oversleeping... But I much rather would've left my sleeping bra on than go braless!) Nozomi: (U-Urk... Maybe I should just fess up so I can go home to get my bra... But I'm too embarrassed to say anything!) Kanna: It's about that time. Natsume: We'd better open the cafe.

If you'd suggested this takoyaki party out of pity for me or something, I probably wouldn't have come. Natsume: But since it seemed like you were asking more out of personal desire, I thought: \"Sure, why not?\" Kousei: Personal desire? I didn't have any ulterior motives or anything. Natsume: Is that the truth? You weren't expecting anything to happen? Not even a little? Kousei: Well... maybe a little. A man can dream, can't he? Kousei: But I'm well aware of the difference between fantasy and reality, so please, don't call the police. Natsume: I won't, relax. If I really thought you were that untrustworthy, I wouldn't have come in the first place. Kousei: Well, thanks. Natsume: Did you have fun today, Takamine-kun? Kousei: Yeah. I had fun.

Kousei: Well, yeah. Fun is subjective. Natsume: It was the same back then, when I missed my friend's takoyaki party because I was in the hospital. That itself, I didn't mind. There was nothing I could have done about it, after all. Natsume: But once I got out of the hospital and went back to school... Natsume: What do you think bugged me the most? Take a guess. Kousei: The fact that everyone else was talking about how fun the party was? Natsume: Wrong. Natsume: What really bugged me was how quickly they'd forgotten about it. They said it was fun, sure, but by the time we were back in school, they were already reminiscing about New Year's and looking forward to Valentine's Day. Kousei: Hmm... Kousei: You're saying you felt like you were left behind? Natsume: That's not it either. Well, you're not exactly wrong, per se. It's a bit hard to explain, to be honest. Natsume: But either way, I didn't feel like I was part of their group anymore. And eventually, we drifted apart... Natsume: ...... Natsume: Sorry. That was a stupid thing to say. Guess I drank too much. Kousei: It's all good. I'm the one who asked in the first place. Kousei: But honestly, I feel like the alcohol just makes you a lot more talkative. Or at least, a lot more honest. Natsume: Shut up. Natsume: *sigh*... The inside of my mouth's still tingling. Kousei: Want some ice cream? I've got vanilla. Natsume: Sure, I guess. Kousei: Thanks for hanging out with me today. Kousei: It was fun. I don't get to eat takoyaki all that often, and you even ate my share of the \"surprises\" for me. Natsume: Seriously, why was I the only one who kept getting the spicy ones? Kousei: Probably because you're the one who made them. Natsume: *sigh*... Okay, I'm good from here. Thanks for walking me home. Kousei: Alright. See you tomorrow then. Natsume: See you tomorrow. Natsume: Um... I had fun today too. Thanks for inviting me over. Kousei: Glad you had fun.

            "Kousei: Nhh? Ngh? Kousei: Pastry chefs... really have early starts, huh? Suzune: Don't worry. This is far easier compared to working at a bakery. Kousei: Well, good luck. *yaaawn*... Suzune: Quit acting like this doesn't concern you. Starting today, you're going to be my assistant. Suzune: So you'd better shape up, because I'm going to punish you for any mistakes. Kousei: Oh? I might actually enjoy that. Suzune: I can see why you and Hiroto are friends. Kousei: Quit giving me that disgusted look. I was kidding. It's a joke. Suzune: I didn't get up this early to listen to your stupid jokes. Now come on, let's get pumped up for a nice, long day of work! Kousei: *yaaawn*... Kanna: Good morning, Takamine-san. Kousei: Hey, Akizuki-san. Kanna: Rather early today, aren't you? Kousei: We've got some prep work to do in the kitchen. Kousei: You're pretty early yourself, for that matter... Ah, right. I forgot you were renting a room here. Kanna: If you need an extra hand, I'd be happy to help. Kousei: That's fine. Suzune-san and I are the ones responsible for the kitchen. We might get really busy sometimes, but we're fine for today. Kousei: I'm sure there'll be plenty of things that I'll need your help with later, though. Kanna: Alright. Kanna: I'll leave you to it then. But if there's anything you need, don't hesitate to let me know. Kousei: I will. Thanks. Suzune: Phew. That doesn't look too bad. Kousei: Wow... Suzune: They don't LOOK delicious; they ARE delicious. Kousei: I admire your confidence. Suzune: Well, I'm a professional. I wouldn't serve something if I wasn't confident in the taste. Kousei: Fair point. Kousei: Mind if I try one? Suzune: Go ahead. They're still hot, though, so be careful. Kousei: Don't worry, I--Ahh?! Suzune: What did I just say? Suzune: Piece of cake. Kousei: These are going to be a hit for sure. Phew... Suzune: I hope so. But they're definitely a lot better when they're fresh out of the oven. Suzune: Wrap them up for me once they've cooled down a bit, will you? Kousei: Uh-huh. Suzune: So make sure each person gets a free sample too. Kousei: I'm sure they'll garner us a lot of attention. Kanna: We've got our flyers ready, and our complimentary madeleines. Natsume: I guess we're all set then. Let's go hand them out. Mei: What? We're just gonna go and hand 'em out? That feels kinda weird. Natsume: Isn't that why we printed them out? Mei: Not the flyers. Mei: If we're going to be advertising the cafe, shouldn't we be wearing something more appropriate? Nozomi: Ohh, I see what you're saying. Nozomi: It'd make a lot more sense than handing out flyers in our regular clothes. Natsume: Wait, you don't mean... Natsume: You want me to go outside wearing THIS?! Kanna: Well, people are going to see you in it either way once the cafe opens. Natsume: I know that, but I can't... This skirt is just way too short. Mei: You're fiiine. If anything, you look even sexier when you squirm with embarrassment like that. Nozomi: Yeah, it kind of only attracts attention instead. Natsume: I really don't want people to think I'm cosplaying, though. Kanna: But the more we stand out, the more customers we're likely to attract. Don't you want that? Natsume: I know. I'll do it. Complaining won't do anything. Suzune: That's the spirit. Kousei: Alright. I'm gonna go put these flyers in the neighborhood mailboxes. Kanna: The rest of us will be handing out flyers and madeleines at the station. Nozomi: Got it! Mei: Aye, aye, captain. Suzune: Ah, actually, I'll go help him with the mailboxes. Mei: Are you sure? Don't you want to come with us and see how people react to your pastries? Suzune: I am a bit curious, I'll admit... but I'll pass this time. Kanna: That's fine. I doubt Takamine-san would be able to handle all of it on his own anyway. Natsume: Alright. Let's get going, everybody. Everyone: Okay! Suzune: Pretty much. If anyone saw me advertising for my new workplace right in front of the place I just quit, they'd think I was picking a fight or something. Suzune: Not that I particularly care what they think, but that's no reason to purposely go looking for trouble, you know? Kousei: You still hold a grudge against them, don't you? Suzune: ...... Suzune: Did Hiroto tell you? Kousei: Well, it wasn't from him, but I more or less heard the whole story. Suzune: I don't who told you what, but from what Hiroto told me, I don't think he was given an accurate account of what really went down. Kousei: You had a bad experience at your old workplace, didn't you? Suzune: Work is work. It's not always fun and games. Of course I had some bad experiences. Suzune: Especially in the beginning--it felt like less of a job and more of a boot camp. Suzune: Still, the only reason I can call myself a pastry chef is because they hired me. So, in that sense, I don't really resent them or anything. Kousei: I heard the owner was treating you unfairly. Something about a patissier competition? Suzune: Urgh, that. Suzune: You see, we originally held our own baking contests in-house. The goal was to make an item that could be sold for 500 yen, and I ended up losing. Suzune: I clearly won in terms of taste, but I only lost because the judgment criteria included the cost-to-sales ratio as well. Suzune: Obviously mine was the better tasting one. Like, why should I even lose to something that tastes worse? Keep all that other stupid crap out of it. Kousei: If you're so convinced, then why'd you quit? Suzune: I guess in the end, it was due to all the corner-cutting they were doing. Of course, I fully understand that a business has to make a profit. Suzune: But still, I can't just abandon my principles as a baker for that crap. Suzune: I couldn't accept that we weren't selling our best to the customers. That was the last straw for me, so I quit. Suzune: After that, I couldn't find a job anywhere else. Maybe it's the job market these days, or maybe rumors spread about me being a bossy person who'll butt heads with whoever's in charge. Kousei: You sure it wasn't your old boss trying to sabotage you? Suzune: I don't know about that. He could have badmouthed me behind my back, sure. We did bicker and feud a lot. Suzune: In retrospect, though, I WAS pretty stuck-up back then. Honestly, who did I think I was, arguing with a veteran with years more experience than me? Hahaha. Suzune: But even though I got on his nerves a lot, I doubt he sincerely hated me or anything. Suzune: My job was tough, sure, but he never did anything to me that could qualify as harassment... at least, I don't think so. Suzune: For one thing, I doubt he'd have the time to single me out, even if he wanted to. Kousei: Ah, okay. Suzune: Even if he did hate me, he didn't have the kind of clout to prevent me from getting hired literally anywhere. Suzune: In fact, if he tried something like that, it'd probably only give me more sympathy points. Suzune: Ahem. This is not the time to be standing around chatting. We're supposed to be handing out flyers. Kousei: Right. Sorry for dragging all that stuff up. Suzune: It's alright. Now let's get to working, kiddo. Suzune: We should split up to save time. You go that way. I don't wanna see a single flyer in your hand when you come back. Suzune: I'll go this way. See you back in a bit, okay? "

            "Kousei: It's a bit late, but I'm thinking of trying bookkeeping. Kousei: I'm also planning to take a few courses in business management too, though. Hiroto: Uh, wouldn't it be an easier idea to just renroll into the College of Business? Kousei: I thought about that, but I decided to just study the basics, then pick up the rest as I go along. Kousei: I think I'll learn a lot more that way, rather than just sitting in school. Hiroto: Hmm... Where are you gonna work then? Kousei: Probably... not at some big company. Kousei: I'm trying to learn a bit more about accounting and that sort of stuff at the cafe. And after that... Kousei: I'm thinking of asking my dad to teach me a few things too. Hiroto: Didn't you say your dad was a painter or something? Kousei: Yeah, but he also does some other consulting work on the side. Hiroto: Huh... Okay. Kousei: What about you? What are you planning on doing? Hiroto: Still trying to figure that out. Hiroto: I'm jealous as hell, though. You don't have to job hunt like the rest of us. Kousei: I mean, I'm basically just postponing it till later. Kousei: I pretty much still haven't decided anything about my future yet. Hiroto: Guess that's true... Hiroto: Welp, good luck in your future endeavors. Hope you earn lots of money, brother-in-law. Kousei: I'll try to, Hiroto-kun. Hiroto: ...... Kousei: ...... Hiroto & Kousei: Blllaaarrrggghhh! Hiroto: Calling you that makes me wanna puke... Kousei: Yeah, same for me. Seriously, please don't call me that ever again. Hiroto: But you ARE going out with my sister, aren't you? Kousei: Yeah. Hiroto: Well, I'm glad. By all means, take that worthless baggage off my hands. Kousei: Hey. Don't go calling my girlfriend worthless. I'll beat your ass. Hiroto: My bad. Kousei: If I wasn't serious about your sister, I wouldn't be going out with her. Hiroto: Yeah, I know. Despite all her flaws, I guess she is pretty devoted, for what it's worth. Hiroto: When she decided to become a pastry chef, she threw herself body and soul into that too. Kousei: It's that passion that got her to where she is today. Hiroto: Yeah, I guess so. Hiroto: Just try not to get yourself stabbed, alright? Kousei: I doubt that's gonna happen. Hiroto: Well, if you say so. Hiroto: But I gotta ask... What the hell do you find attractive about her? Kousei: What do you mean? Hiroto: Is it the whole \"jailbait\" thing she has going on? Kousei: No, not really. In fact, I'm actually more of a fan of big tits. Hiroto: Yet you're going out with a girl that's got none? Kousei: Yeah, well... I'm more attracted to who she is on the inside. Hiroto: I don't get it... To me, she's a total menace. Kousei: Don't say that. She can be cute too, you know. Hiroto: Her? Cute? Honestly... I just don't get your tastes, man. Suzune: Gnhrgghhh... Natsume: Order coming in. I need two plates of pancakes, one with strawberry syrup and one with chocolate syrup. Suzune: A-Alright... Natsume: Hmm? Natsume: Is something the matter? Suzune: Sorry, my chest just hurts a little... Natsume: What? That sounds serious! You should go to the hospital! Suzune: Uhh, it's not the kind of chest pain you're thinking of. Natsume: But you're still in pain, aren't you? Suzune: Yes, I am.. Suzune: These wires... are really digging into my skin... Grngh... Natsume: Come again? Natsume: Ahh... Your skin's already turning red. Suzune: How the hell does wearing a bra hurt this much... Natsume: That's just how underwire bras are, I'm afraid. Suzune: I've heard the stories, but I didn't think it'd be THIS bad. Natsume: You normally wear more comfortable ones, don't you? Suzune: Yeah. I don't really need that much support, given my cup size. Natsume: You shouldn't force yourself to wear them. If they chafe too much, you might even start bleeding. Suzune: Ngh... Natsume: Why are you grimacing? Suzune: Because of that little shit, Kousei... Do you know what he said to me the first time he saw me undress? Kousei: It's hard to see you as an adult, wearing that kind of underwear... Suzune: Can you believe that? Natsume: Yes... I actually can... Suzune: Well, anyway, I figured it couldn't hurt to wear something a little more my age. Suzune: Also, I think he's a tits kind of guy, so I thought I'd throw him a bone and try on a push-up bra. Natsume: Ah, so that's why you're wearing a wire bra. Suzune: Still... pushing them together hasn't done anything except make them look like two identical acorns. Suzune: Hey, shuddup! My nipples ain't acorns, dammit! Natsume: I didn't say that. Natsume: Nobody said a single thing about your nipples. Please stop trying to use raunchy jokes to escape from reality. Suzune: Sorry... Natsume: In any case, there are plenty of nice-looking bras out there that don't have wires in them. Suzune: Would you be willing to come help me pick? Natsume: What, you mean underwear shopping? Suzune: Yeah. I've only ever worn the most comfortable bras I could find... so I don't how to find anything else. Natsume: Ah... Well, sure. I guess I don't mind. Suzune: Really?! Thank you so much! Suzune: I'll show you who's an adult woman, Kousei. Hehehe... Just you wait. Suzune: Kousei. Kousei: Yeah? What's up? Suzune: Mind if I take a break? A bit of a long one, actually. Suzune: In fact... I might not be back until closing. Kousei: Alright. That's fine. Kousei: I imagine you have some sort of reason for doing so. Suzune: Yeah. Thanks. Suzune: Don't worry, you won't regret it. Anyway, take care of things here for me. Kousei: Can do. Kousei: \"I won't regret it\"? Natsume: Suzune-san sure is cute, isn't she? It's kind of surprising how devoted she is. Kousei: What are you talking about? Natsume: Nothing. Natsume: Anyway, I'm going to be taking a rather long break as well. Don't wait up. Kousei: Oh, okay. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Both of them are taking an extended break at the same time? Kousei: Well, whatever. Kousei: Oh, well. It's just for one day, so I don't really mind. Kousei: Still... where on earth did Suzune-san go off to? Kousei: Or maybe I should just mind my own business. Kousei: Hrmh... Honestly, the subtleties of the female mind are far beyond me. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Well, at least I'm done cleaning now. Kousei: Hm? Suzune: Oh? You're finished already? Kousei: Yeah. Suzune: Damn... Sorry. I tried to hurry back as soon I could. Kousei: It's fine. Kousei: ...... Suzune: Phew... That feels so much better. Wish I would've gone with this first. Kousei: What are you talking about? Suzune: Nothin'. Don't worry about it. Kousei: Er... by the way. You don't have to answer if you don't want to, but I'm curious. Kousei: Where exactly did you go? Suzune: Where? Do you really wanna know? Kousei: Well, yeah. Suzune: Heh... *giggle*... You little horndog. Kousei: What does that have to do with anything? Suzune: Good question... *giggle* Kousei: Did you not want me asking about it? Suzune: No, that's fine. But, hmm... Suzune: Let's see. I suppose you DO deserve a reward for holding down the fort on your own... *giggle* Suzune: Is that all you want? Kousei: Well, if you're offering me something... even more appetizing, I certainly wouldn't say no. Suzune: I knew you'd say that. You're such a little perv, you know that? Kousei: Excuse me. All I said was \"something more appetizing.\" You're the perv for immediately assuming I meant something sexual. Suzune: Oh-ho? So my assumption was wrong? Kousei: Well, no. It wasn't. Suzune: That's what I thought. *giggle* Kousei: So... are you gonna tell me what you were doing that was so important you needed to skip work for? Suzune: Hmph... Feast your eyes. Kousei: *gulp*... Suzune: *giggle*... I like that reaction. Suzune: This is a little... no, very embarrassing... but seeing you make that face makes it all worth it. Kousei: Well, your underwear is just... that cute and sexy. Suzune: Does it turn you on? Kousei: You have no idea. Hell, there's no way I wouldn't be turned on. Suzune: Looks like it... *giggle* You're hard as a rock. Kousei: I had no idea you were into this... Suzune: Actually, what I'm \"into\" is making my boyfriend happy. Kousei: Well, I'm really happy. That erotic lingerie looks amazing on you. Suzune: Oh, come on. It's not THAT erotic. Kousei: I mean, compared to the pairs you usual wear... it definitely is. Suzune: Is it, though? I don't have any boobs. Kousei: It still turns me on. Suzune: *giggle*... You perv... Kousei: I don't wanna hear that coming from someone wearing sexy underwear. Suzune: Yeah, I guess... Even I'm surprised at how dirty a girl I've become... Suzune: It's all your fault. Suzune: All your reactions are just too cute... way too cute. Kousei: Well, you say you like them. Suzune: Yeah, but, like... Actually, wait. Aren't you staring a little TOO much? Kousei: It's not my fault... I can't stop myself. Kousei: You went through the trouble of buying a pair of sexy lingerie for my sake, after all. Suzune: I told you, stop calling it that. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Just out of curiosity... What do your panties look like? Suzune: They came in a set, obviously... Do you want to see them? Kousei: Absolutely. Suzune: Geez, you really are a perv. Suzune: *giggle* I like that reaction. It's nice and honest. Kousei: What, and yours isn't? Kousei: I've been staring at you this whole time. Suzune: Well... yeah... It's been flipped a little bit, I guess. Kousei: Only a little? Suzune: Yes... Kousei: You did buy these specifically to show me... Suzune: Well, if you're that crazy about me... I guess I kinda have to. Kousei: Well, I won't deny that I'm crazy for you... Kousei: I knew you were turned on. You're ridiculously turned on. Suzune: Ugh... I can't believe I'm getting these wet on the very day I bought them. Kousei: Don't worry. Mine are just as wet. Suzune: That doesn't make me feel any better... Wait. They are? Kousei: Yep. They're sticky with cum. Suzune: Then why don't you take them off? Kousei: Huh? Suzune: I mean, you don't want them getting any more dirty, so why not just take your dick out? Suzune: Plus it's embarrassing for me to be the only one doing this... Hurry up and show me your body too. Kousei: This all is your fault, just so you know. Suzune: It's so hard... and stiff... *pant* *pant*... It's hard not to remember... Suzune: But if I take them off, how are you gonna get a good look at them? I bought them for you, remember? Kousei: Well, do you want them to get dirty? Suzune: N-No. I just bought them... It'd be a shame if they got any dirtier than they already are. Kousei: You're totally soaked. Suzune: This is... the first time I've ever gotten this wet without touching it... Kousei: Don't you normally get this wet when you touch it? Suzune: I mean... You'd know more about that than me. Kousei: I guess so. Kousei: I was just wondering if you've ever masturbated... Suzune: Why do you want to know? Kousei: Well... I kinda want to see how you do it. Suzune: How I do it? *pant* *pant*... I just do it normally, I guess... Kousei: That's my point. I don't know what \"normally\" means. Kousei: I'm a guy. Suzune: I mean, I don't know what to tell you... It's not like I masturbate THAT often... Suzune: *pant*... *pant*... *inhale*... *pant*... Kousei: ...... Suzune: *pant*... Gosh, could you not stare so much? Kousei: I'm just curious. So this is how you do it... Right there's your clit, right? Suzune: *pant* *pant*... Y-Yeah. This is the spot I usually like to touch... Nhh?! Mhh, mhh! Kousei: You really like playing with your clit, huh? Kousei: You seem like you'd enjoy fingering yourself too, though. Suzune: Mhh! Ah, ah! Nh... It doesn't feel as good... when I do it myself... *pant* *pant*... Suzune: I think I like it better when you do it instead... Nh, nhhh! Kousei: That makes me... ridiculously happy to hear. Suzune: Gosh... It's your fault I've become such a dirty girl. Kousei: That's supposed to be a compliment, right? Suzune: Yeah... Nhhh! My fingers won't stop... *pant* *pant* *pant*... *pant*... Kousei: C'mon. Let me get a better look. Suzune: Nooo... *pant* *pant*... *pant* *pant*... Kousei: You're not about to cum already, are you? Kousei: Judging my how much you're twitching, though... it looks like you are. Suzune: I don't know! I don't know, but... Suzune: Ah, ah, ahhh! This feels so good... It really turns me on, being watched while I do this... Ahhhh! Kousei: *pant*... *pant*... *pant*... Suzune: W-Wow... Your dick is so stiff it's almost touching your stomach... and it's leaking so much too... Kousei: I feel like I'm about to explode just from watching you masturbate... Suzune: You sure have a spunky dick, don't you? Kousei: Don't act like you don't love it. Suzune: Yeah, I do... I love your hard dick... Just remembering how good it felt last time is enough to make me... Ahh! Ahhhh! Kousei: That's fine. Do it. Show me how you cum. Suzune: *pant*... *pant*... So do you... Kousei: I can't hold back anymore. You'll take responsibility for making me so horny... won't you? Kousei: I'd expect a proper adult woman to. Suzune: You're right. I am an adult woman... *giggle* Suzune: Ahh! H-Hold on... You want to do it like this? Kousei: You don't? Suzune: Well, the problem is... my feet can't even touch the ground. Kousei: Don't worry. I'll support you. Kousei: I'll support you no matter what, Suzune-san. Suzune: I thought you said you wanted ME to take responsibility... I can't do anything like this. Kousei: Come on... Please? Suzune: There you go, giving me those puppy-dog eyes again... You just wanted to give this a try, didn't you? Suzune: Fine. Have it your way. Kousei: That's why I love you. Suzune: Yeah, yeah... But if I tell you it hurts, then you'd better pump the brakes, mister. Kousei: Hmm... I'll try my best. No guarantees, though. Kousei: It feels way too good inside you. My brakes might end up malfunctioning. Suzune: Why am I not surprised? In fact, it feels like you're on the verge of losing control already... Suzune: Well... that's because I already came once... Kousei: I take it you're more than ready then? Suzune: You don't need to ask. Kousei: You're right. Sorry. Kousei: This where I'm supposed to take the initiative, right? Suzune: A-Ah, ahhh! Nghhh?! Kousei: Doesn't seem like it hurt, though. Kousei: Your body's gotten so greedy. Suzune: Who's fault do you think that is? Ah, ahh, ah, ahh! Kousei: Huh? Suzune: Urk! Nhhggghhhhhh! Kousei: Ngh... You're tightening up so much... Kousei: Did you just cum again? Suzune: Ahh! *pant* *pant*... *pant*... *pant*... Kousei: All I did was put it in, you know? Suzune: I couldn't help it, okay? I'm still sensitive from cumming earlier... *pant*... *pant*... Suzune: Are you saying I wasn't cute at first? Kousei: I'm saying your cuteness has skyrocketed. You were cute at first, but now you're ridiculously cute. Kousei: I love you... so much... Suzune: Ahhh?! Kousei: It feels amazing for me too. Kousei: You're so hot and sticky... I don't think I can control myself. Suzune: You perv... Kousei: Right back at ya. Suzune: Yeah, you're right... We're both huge perverts. Kousei: Agreed. Kousei: Especially... this dirty pussy of yours. Kousei: See? Look how tightly it's gripping me. Suzune: Y-Yeah... because you're rubbing me with something so thick... Nghh! Ah?! Ah, ah?! Suzune: W-Wait, wait! You're rubbing me too much! Ahhhhhh! Kousei: That's only because you're clamping down so tightly... Nhh... Kousei: You're squeezing all my sensitive spots... Ngh... Suzune: Ahhh, ah! Ah, ah! You're hitting all my weak spots too! Ah, ah, ah! Kousei: You mean... right here? Suzune: Ahhhhhh! Yes, right there! That feels amazing! Nhhhhhhh! Kousei: You like this spot, don't you? Suzune: Ahh! Yes, yes, yes! Ah, ahhh! Oh god! I'm going crazy! Ahhhhhh! Kousei: You look so cute right now... So sexy. Suzune: *pant* *pant*... *pant*... Your dick is so hot and hard... It feels so good! Kousei: S-Suzune-san! Kousei: I'm sorry, but I can't stop... I can't stop myself anymore! Suzune: Your switch is totally flipped! Ahhhh! Nhhh, ack... Ahhhh! Kousei: I'm way past my tipping point... Your pussy feels way too good! Suzune: Ah, ah, ah, ah! Ngh... Nghh?! Kousei: I can keep grinding you like this, right? Suzune: Nhhhh! Y-Yes, keep going! Ah, ahh! Ahh! Kousei: I'll do what I can! Suzune: Nh, ahh, ahhhhhh! *pant* *pant* *pant*! I love that, I love that! Kousei: Suzune-san, Suzune-san! Suzune: *pant* *pant* Ahhh! More! More, more! Ah, ah, ah, ahhhhhhh! Suzune: I can't help iiitttt... Ahhhhhhh! You're gonna make me cum... You're making me cum! Kousei: I'm... about to cum too! Suzune: Ah, ah, ahhh! You're getting so big... swelling up inside me so much! Nh, ahhhh! Kousei: I can keep going, can't I? I can, right? Actually, I'm sorry--I can't stop myself anymore. Suzune: Nh, nhh! It's okay... You can cum... Just please, keep grinding... Ah, ah, ahhh! Suzune: I've never! I've never felt this good befoooore! Kousei: You're making such a dirty face... Suzune: I can't control it! Ah! Ah! Ahhhhhhhh! Suzune: No, wait! Wait! Just a little longer! Ahh! Kousei: Ngh, hngh! Kousei: Suzune-san, Suzune-san! I'm cumming! Suzune: Nhh, nghh! Me too! Ahh! Me too! I'm cumming... I'm cumming, I'm cumming, I'm cumming! Suzune: Ngh, ahhhhhhhhh! Suzune: Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh! Suzune: *pant* *pant*... Getting creampied... feels amazing... Kousei: Ngh... Your pussy's wringing me dry... Kousei: *pant*... *pant*... This seems a little uncomfortable for you, though. Kousei: I'm gonna let you down, okay? Suzune: O-Okay... But if you take it out right now... Nghh?! Kousei: S-Suzune-san, I'm cumming... I'm gonna cum, okay? Kousei: I-I'm cumming! Suzune: Ah, ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Suzune: Gosh, you cum too much... *pant*... *pant*... But it felt amazing. Kousei: It felt amazing for me too... Suzune: I can hardly stand... Kousei: Don't worry. I've got you. Suzune: Thanks... but no round two, okay? I seriously can't. Kousei: ...... Suzune: Oh, come on. Don't pretend like you cant hear me, you little perv. Suzune: Seriously, though. You got way too carried away. Kousei: Only because you were showing off your bra and panties to me. Suzune: So I take it they were to your liking? Kousei: Do you really need to ask? Suzune: I guess not. *giggle* Kousei: They got me super horny. Kousei: Almost TOO horny... After all that, my body feels kinda drained. Suzune: Well, good. If I'm being honest, though, I wanted something that would make my boobs a little bigger. Kousei: Don't worry. It would be all the same, either way. Suzune: Wow. You want an ass-beatin'? Kousei: Sorry, I didn't mean it like that. Kousei: I just meant I'm happy you went out of your way to pick these for me. That's all that matters. Suzune: Really? Kousei: Yeah. Suzune: Well, the truth is... I actually bought a couple other bras as well. Kousei: Lemme see! Suzune: Whoa, whoa. I thought you said you were already drained? Kousei: I'm not saying we have to do it today. Kousei: We'll have plenty of opportunities in the future to put them to good use. Suzune: Yeah, you're right. Suzune: After all, you promised you'd continue supporting me forever, didn't you? Kousei: That I did. Suzune: Perfect! I'm gonna hold you that. "

            "Suzune: Yep. Good job. Phew! I'm glad that's over with. Kousei: Thanks for the help. Kanna: We were pretty busy today, huh? The afternoon tea set seemed to be even more popular than we anticipated. Kousei: Thank goodness for that. Mikado: I wonder what our guests will be saying about the event today? Hopefully they'll be back again next week as well. Mikado: At the very least, it didn't seem unpopular. Kousei: I hope you're right. Suzune: I had a little peek outside, earlier... and I gotta say, you were doing much a better job than I thought. Kousei: Really? Well, I'm glad you thought so. Suzune: Let me apologize for what I said. I'm sorry I underestimated you. Suzune: You actually make a pretty impressive butler. All calm and civilized--you almost seemed like a different person. Kousei: I'm deeply honored by your praise, milady. Suzune: Knowing how you usually act, it does feel a teensy bit pretentious, though. Mikado: At any rate, as long as there are no major problems or complaints from our customers, we shall continue holding this event every Tuesday for the rest of the month, and see how things go. Kousei: Sure. Sounds good to me. Kousei: Is that okay with you too, Suzune-san, Akizuki-san? Suzune: Sure. Kanna: Of course. Suzune: Welp, guess we'd better start cleaning up. Kousei: Oh, before I forget... there's something I need to take care of after this. Kanna: What's that? Kousei: I want to work on correcting a couple mistakes I made today while they're still fresh in my mind. Kanna: Is there anything I can help with? Kousei: Thanks, but I can handle it on my own. I just wanted to practice my tea-pouring technique a little more. Kanna: Alright. I understand. Mikado: Now then, time to clean up. Natsume: What? Kousei: Would you mind staying behind for a bit later? I want you to help me with my practice. Natsume: Didn't you just finish saying you could handle it yourself? Kousei: Yeah, I know... but please? Natsume: Well, I guess I can. Kousei: You've been acting weird ever since this afternoon, so I thought I should talk to you about it. Natsume: ...... Kousei: Did I do something to upset you during the event? Natsume: No... not really... Kousei: What do you mean, not really? Natsume: ...... Natsume: It's not what you're thinking. I think the event today went really well too. Kousei: Did I make you proud, as your boyfriend? Natsume: Well... Yeah, you did... Natsume: You made Suzune-san eat her words, just like you promised. Kousei: Oh. Well, I'm glad I did something right. Kousei: But why does it feel like you're not happy about something? Natsume: Um... Kousei: Was there some kind of problem with the event? Natsume: Yes, there was. A much more serious problem than I expected. Kousei: Seriously?! Is it bad enough that it'll stop us from continuing the event? Natsume: Possibly... Kousei: Nobody said a word, though... and I didn't notice anything myself. What was the problem? Natsume: The problem is... my stress levels. Kousei: Say what? Natsume: You were charming and dapper today... So much so that watching you made me realize all over again why I love you so much... Kousei: What? M-Me? Um... Thanks? Kousei: Wait, why am I suddenly being buried in compliments? What does this have to do with this serious problem you mentioned? Natsume: The point is, you were acting TOO cool. That's the issue. Natsume: Didn't you notice the way some customers were flirting with you? Kousei: Flirting? With me? Natsume: That girl kept asking for your number, asking you to be her personal butler, and so on and so on. Don't you remember? Kousei: Well, yeah... I guess she did. Kousei: But she was just teasing, wasn't she? I thought maybe her friends dared her or something. Natsume: Only little kids do stuff like that. Kousei: Oh, uh... really? Kousei: So then she really was... Natsume: Yes. She was seriously flirting with you. If you'd given her your number, she'd probably have you going to a hotel with her by now. Kousei: What? Come on. She wouldn't do that with a guy she just met. Natsume: That's the kind of girl she is. Plus, a lot of those older women were ogling you too. Kousei: ...... Kousei: So what you're saying is, everyone else thought I was boyfriend material too. Natsume: Well... I suppose you could put it that way. Kousei: That's what has you so stressed you're thinking about canceling the event? Kousei: Look, you have nothing to worry about. You're the only girl for me, Natsume. Kousei: Case in point, I didn't give that girl my number when she asked. Natsume: Only because you didn't even notice she was hitting on you. Kousei: Well, maybe not. Kousei: But even if I had noticed, I would've turned her down, all the same. Kousei: There's only one girl I love. And that's you. Natsume: Ah... Nh... Natsume: N-Nhhh... Nhh... Mhhh... Kousei: Mhh... *kiss* *kiss*... Kousei: I love you, Natsume... Only you... *smooch*... Natsume: Nhh! *kiss* *smack*... You're my only one... I love you too... Nhh... *kiss* *smooch*... Natsume: Ahh! *pant* *pant*... *pant*... Kousei: The only reason I'm doing this event is for the cafe. Not so I can make you worry, Natsume. Natsume: I know. I'm sorry for being so annoying. Kousei: Don't be. You're always so cool and composed... It's nice to see you let your emotions out for a change. Even jealousy. Natsume: I really do love you, you know? That's why I felt so anxious... and jealous. Natsume: But it's your fault for being so damn charming. Even I was swooning just watching you. Kousei: Really?! Kousei: That makes the whole event worth it for me. Natsume: It made me really happy, seeing you work so hard for my sake. Kousei: O-Okay. Natsume: You're the only one I'd ever do this for... and don't you forget it. Natsume: Wow... You're already rock hard. *giggle*... So this turns you on, does it? Kousei: Err... Natsume: I always knew you were a pervert. Kousei: This is hardly anything unusual, is it? Kousei: Any healthy guy would pop a boner when a girl's flashing her panties and touching him... Natsume: So you're fine with anybody, as long as they show you their panties? Is that it? Kousei: I'm only this hard because they're your panties, Natsume. Natsume: You're this hard just from seeing my panties? Are you sure? Kousei: Urk... Natsume: Oh, is it? You seem to be twitching rather gleefully, though, considering. Kousei: Only because you're the one humiliating me, Natsume. Natsume: Pfft... You're honest, at least. Just like your body. Kousei: No, I'm not that backed up... Natsume: But if it's gotten this hot--How about this! Kousei: Eek! Natsume: What's the matter? You're letting out some pathetic whimpers. Kousei: I can't help it... when you grind on it like that... Ngh! Natsume: You're so cute... as is the way you moan... Kousei: Is that supposed to be a compliment? Natsume: Of course. This is my way of rewarding you for working so hard today. Kousei: If this is a reward, then why am I getting my cock stepped on? Natsume: Judging from your previous reactions, I was under the impression you rather liked this sort of humiliation. Natsume: Was I wrong? Kousei: %123;Thank you for stepping on me! Natsume: That's what I thought. I'm glad you're being honest... That's what I love about you. *giggle* Kousei: I'm not trying to hide it. Kousei: It feels amazing. Having you step on my cock is actually... incredibly arousing. Natsume: *giggle*... That's a good boy. Kousei: No... If anything, it feels better than words can describe. Natsume: I can tell. Look how much you're twitching... At this rate, you're going to blow in no time at all. Natsume: Well... I'll leave it to your imagination. But don't worry, I haven't been unfaithful. Kousei: I know. I wasn't worried about that... but seriously, you're way too good at this. Natsume: The head's getting all slippery now. Plus... *sniff*... it smells really lewd too... Kousei: Oh, come on. It doesn't smell. Natsume: Sure it does. Here, what if I do this? Now it's easier to tell, right? Kousei: Ahh... Kousei: It doesn't smell like anything to me. Natsume: Hmm... Still being stubborn, I see. Natsume: That's what you get for lying. Kousei: I wasn't lying. First of all, pre-cum doesn't even have a smell. Natsume: But... Kousei: Maybe what you're smelling is... pheromones? Kousei: Getting stepped on by you is really turning me on. Natsume: Oh. Maybe you're right; you are leaking a lot... *pant*... *pant*... Kousei: It looks like you're pretty aroused yourself, Natsume... Natsume: Why do you say that? Kousei: Your breathing's getting really erotic. Also, I can see it from here. Kousei: A small stain is starting to form on your panties. Natsume: Urk... Um... Kousei: So this is turning you on too, huh? I can't believe you're getting wet just by rubbing me with your foot. Natsume: That's because you look like you're enjoying this so much. Natsume: Seeing you make that face, letting out such sweet moans... It's hard to not get aroused. Natsume: And your cock... it's so hot and stiff and leaky... *pant*... *pant*... "

The way you use your tongue feels incredible... Kousei: Have you practiced this a lot? Natsume: *lick* *slurp* *lick*... Well, a little. Natsume: Only with my friends, though. Girl friends, that is. And I only practiced with their fingers. Kousei: I'm not doubting you. I'm just wondering what the hell they're teaching you. Natsume: Stuff like this... *lick* *lick*... How to move my tongue... Natsume: Ahmph, *suck*... *suck*... *slurp* *smack*... And this too... Natsume: Ahh! *pant* *pant*... Also, how... talking dirty... makes guys happy... Kousei: What sort of stuff? Natsume: You know, like... \"Your c-cock tastes amazing\"... or something. Kousei: Ngh?! Natsume: Wh-Why are you looking at me like that?

I didn't think it'd taste so bad you'd want to gag... Natsume: That's not it... It's just a little hard to swallow, since it sticks to my throat... But as for the taste, well... *lick*... It's not awful. Kousei: N-Natsume! I can't-- Natsume: Mhh?! *plop*--Ahh, *pant*... Kousei: Kgh--ahh! Natsume: Ah! Ahhhhhh?! Natsume: So this is what semen tastes like... *lick* *lick*... *slurp*... I don't think I hate it. Kousei: R-Really? Well, I'm glad to hear it... Natsume: But I'm surprised how much there is. I had no idea... *pant* *pant*... I had no idea you could let out so much. Kousei: That's 'cause you wouldn't slow down, even though I begged you to. Natsume: You didn't like it? Kousei: No, I loved it. It felt amazing.  Natsume: That's a relief... *pant* *pant*... You looked really cute when you were cumming. Kousei: Natsume... Remember what you said earlier? Kousei: You said you'd show me how wet you were down there after I came... Natsume: You still haven't had enough? Kousei: Hell no. Your blowjob felt incredible, sure... Kousei: But I won't be satisfied unless I put it in you. Natsume: *giggle*... Oh, alright. I guess I did promise. Natsume: There we... go. Kousei: I'm not put off. Kousei: I'm just... surprised at how wet you are. Natsume: I was just as wet last time too, wasn't I? Kousei: Yeah, but that's because I was the one licking you. This time, you were the one licking me. Kousei: It's hard to believe you got this wet... just from sucking my cock. Natsume: Something wrong with that? Kousei: Not at all. If anything, it makes me really happy. Kousei: How could I not be? Seeing your pussy gets me unbelievably excited. Natsume: Then... do you want to do it? Kousei: I do! Kousei: O-Okay. Take it slow. Natsume: Ngh... Natsume: I'm not doing it on purpose. But for some reason, I can't--Huh? Kousei: Ahhh... N-Natsume... Natsume: I know it feels good, but if you don't stay still, I won't be able to put it in. Kousei: But I'm not moving... Natsume: Now, here's a question for you. Are you inside me now? Kousei: Yeah. One hundred percent. Natsume: Nhh, correct. Ahh... You can feel it that clearly, can you? Kousei: I mean, it's in plain view. And more importantly... it's incredibly warm and slippery inside you. Kousei: I can't believe you got this wet from giving me a blowjob... Natsume: You're one to talk... Look how stiff you are even after cumming once already... Ahh?! Ahh! Nhh! Natsume: H-Hey! I told you not to move! *pant*... *pant*... Kousei: It's so hot inside you too... Shit... Natsume: Nh, ah... I can't... I'm losing strength... Ah, ah... I can't... Ahhhhh! Kousei: Hold on, that... Shit... That feels so good, it's like I'm melting... Natsume: Huh? But I haven't even started moving yet... Kousei: You're moving plenty. Kousei: The way you slide your hips back and forth like that... is turning my head to mush... Natsume: Oh? Is it now? *pant*... *pant*... Natsume: *giggle*... Looks like you can hardly stand it. Kousei: You're not wrong... This feels mind-blowingly good... Natsume: Hmm. So this is already enough to drive you crazy? Natsume: *giggle* Can't get enough, can you? Don't worry... I'm just getting started. Ah, ah, ah, nhh! Kousei: Natsume, your pussy... feels amazing! Natsume: Your cock too... It's so stiff and so hot... Ah, ah, ahh, ahh! It's stirring me up so much... Ahh! Natsume: *giggle* You're too adorable... *pant* *pant*... I'll do it even more, okay? Nh, ahhh... Kousei: Y-Yeah... It won't be much longer, at this rate. Natsume: Nhh... Okay. Then let's take a little break. Natsume: Because your face looks so adorable when you're drowning in pleasure. Kousei: You're killing me, you know that? Natsume: C'mon, you can hold out a little longer... If you do, it'll feel even better. Kousei: This is torture! Natsume: I know. It looks like you're in a lot of pain... *pant*... *pant*... Natsume: But judging by how much you're twitching inside me... I'm guessing it feels pretty good too... Ngh?! See? Kousei: Ngh... Kgh... Ahh... Natsume: Not yet. Hold it in. Kousei: I can't... It feels too good. Natsume: If you don't hold it in, you're going to end up being a daddy. Is that what you want? Kousei: Ngh! Natsume: Ahh?! Nhh, nhh! You're twitching inside me again... Hngh! Natsume: You're so adorable... Do you really want to cum that badly? Kousei: Well, yeah... Argh, seriously, I can't... Natsume: Ahh... Nh! Nghhh! Kousei: Kgh! Natsume: Ahhhhh... I love you... Eek?! Nhh, ah! Ahh, *pant* *pant*... Nhhhh! Kousei: The way your pussy's coiling around me... It's feels even better than before. Natsume: That's because--! Ahh?! Ah, ah, ah... I'm feeling so g-good too! Ahhhhhh! Kousei: So you're enjoying this too, Natsume... Natsume: Of course I am! I love you... It makes me so happy seeing how good I make you feel... Kousei: I love you too. More than anything... Natsume: *pant* *pant*... Hngh! Ah, ah, ah! It's getting even bigger... Ahh! Kousei: I-I can't... I can't hold it any more! Natsume: Nhh, I know... I know! I'm gonna be a mommy too! Ahh! Ngh! Kousei: Kh! Ahh! N-Natsume! I love you! I love you! Natsume: Me too! I love you, I love you, I love you! Ahh, ahh?! Natsume: Ah, ah, ah, ah... Ahhhhhhhhhhh! Kousei: Natsume... Kgh! Natsume: Did you want to become a daddy that badly? Kousei: With you, I do. And I really wanted to make you a mom too. Natsume: Ah... *giggle*... Nh, nhhh... Natsume: Don't look so put off. It's your cum... I'm the one who should be embarrassed. Kousei: My bad. I'm not put off; I'm just surprised at myself. Kousei: N-Natsume, I'm gonna--! Natsume: Huh? Ah, ahh! Wait, don't--ahhhhhhhhn! Kousei: Sorry, but I can't wait any more! Kousei: I love you... I love you, Natsume! Natsume: Me too! I love you too! Ah, ah, ahhhh! But you can't--not there! Eek?! Natsume: Ah, ah, ah, ahhhhhhhhhhh! Kousei: That's what happens when you make me hold it in for so long. Natsume: I just wanted to make you feel good. But then you started moving on your own... Kousei: Couldn't help myself... Kousei: But still... I only let out so much because of how good you made me feel, Natsume. Natsume: Nhh... Well, fine. Kousei: Man, though. I seriously let out a lot. Natsume: It's okay. This is what I wanted. Natsume: Besides, I got to see all those cute, desperate faces you were making. So I guess we're even. Kousei: Ah... Now I kinda get why you felt so embarrassed about having sex before. Kousei: I'll admit, I went a little crazy back there too. And having the person I love see me like that is... pretty embarrassing. Natsume: Right? Kousei: Still, the happiness I feel more than makes up for it. Natsume: Well... I can't argue with that. Kousei: I gotta say, though, I'm a little surprised. Kousei: I never expected you to be so aggressive today. Natsume: Well, I love you... a whole, whole lot. Natsume: Isn't it normal to want to get down and dirty with the person you love? Kousei: I'm not complaining. I liked it a lot. Natsume: I mean... there are plenty of other cute girls at the cafe that I have to worry about. Natsume: And I've got a needy personality to boot...　So if you were to leave me for some other girl... I might just die. Kousei: Don't say that, even as a joke. Natsume: I'd kill you, and then I'd kill myself. Kousei: %123;Seriously, stop! That's not funny! Natsume: Not that I'm saying I don't trust you, but it's hard to get rid of that little worry in the back of your mind sometimes. Natsume: So that's why I tried to think of something I could do to make you happy... Kousei: And this is what you thought of? Sex? Natsume: Don't you love sex? Kousei: Well... I won't deny that. Kousei: Having sex with you fills me with joy. Natsume: So did I make you happy? Kousei: Of course you did. Just knowing that you think about me is enough to make me happy. Kousei: The sex is just a bonus. Natsume: Well, in that case, I'm glad. Kousei: I'm a simple man. Kousei: Anything and everything my girlfriend does for me makes me happy. Kousei: I love you, Natsume... from the bottom of my heart. I'd never leave your side. Natsume: Mhm... Thanks... Kousei: And since I'll never leave your side... that means we're gonna have to shower together too. Natsume: Oh, come on. I bet you just want to use that as an opportunity to fool around some more, don't you? Kousei: %123;Absolutely. Natsume: You're not supposed to say yes. Kousei: C'mon. We're at a love hotel, for crying out loud. Kousei: Might as well make the most of this huge room and bathtub, don't you think? Natsume: Well... I get your point, but still... *sigh*... Natsume: Fine. Let's shower together. Kousei: Yes! Natsume: But you'd better keep your hands to yourself, alright? I'm too drained for another round right now. Kousei: Yes, ma'am! Natsume: You're way too enthusiastic. Natsume: Alright, come on. Let's go. Natsume: What? Kousei: I just love how you always end up giving in with a big smile on your face. Natsume: Shut up, you dummy. "

Suzune: I'm flattered, but I doubt anyone's waiting in line for us to open. We're not offering any limited-time promotions or anything. Suzune: I'm hoping we get a lot of customers too, but let's not bite off more than we can chew. Suzune: No matter how much we've practiced things, the real deal won't be the same. Kousei: Still, we've reached over 500 followers on Instogram now, so I'd say we've garnered some attention. Mikado: Is that high? Kousei: Well, Hiuchidani-san said it was pretty amazing. It has only been less than a month since we started, and we've only just opened. Mikado: I see. In that case, perhaps we can raise our expectations a little. Kousei: Apparently, our follow count experienced a sudden surge these past few days. Kousei: All thanks to those pictures of you we posted, I'm sure. Mikado: Y-You don't say? Heh. I must say, I did not expect so many people to appreciate my sophistication. Suzune: Even so, our followers could be from anywhere around the globe. There's no guaranteeing they all live in the area. Suzune: If you get yourself too excited, you're just asking to be let down. Kousei: Not very optimistic, are you? Suzune: Ah, sorry. I didn't mean to be a wet blanket. Suzune: I just know how cruel reality can be from personal experience, so I guess I've gotten into the habit of thinking pragmatically. Sorry. Natsume: You don't have to apologize for that. You made a valid point. Natsume: Reality can certainly be unforgiving. But that's why we need to be focused on putting a smile on the face of everyone who walks through our door! Natsume: Once we can do that, people will be lining up outside our cafe in no time at all. Suzune: Yeah, that's exactly what I was trying to say! Kousei: Feels like you're just piggybacking on what she said, though. Suzune: Look, I'm just trying to pep everyone up! Mikado: In any case, both Sumizome-kun and Hiuchidani-kun have classes all morning, so we will be somewhat short-staffed for the time being. Best to keep that in mind. Kousei: Right. The last thing we want to do is inconvenience our customers. Mikado: It is approaching ten now, is it not? Kanna: I'll go flip the door sign to \"Open.\" Natsume: Ah--let me do that. I want to be the one to open the cafe today. Kanna: Of course. By all means. Natsume: *sigh*... We're really open. The day's finally here. Natsume: No, now's not the time to be getting sentimental. This is where the real challenge begins. Let's do this. ???: Finally open, are you? Natsume: Yes! Please, come in! Natsume: We have a customer! Kanna & Suzune & Kousei: Welcome to Cafe Stella! Kazufumi: Oh, it definitely has gotten brighter in here. Both the place and the people. Kazufumi: Hey, guys! I'm here for the big day. Kousei: Welcome. Please, have a seat. Kazufumi: Thanks.

Kanna: And we probably want to do a bit of advertising beforehand too. Kanna: The more promoting we do, the more buzz I think we'll generate on opening day. Natsume: I agree. Suzune: We could stick up posters in front of the shop, hand out flyers... maybe make a website too? Kousei: Don't forget social media. Kousei: We could take some fancy photos of Suzune-san's cakes and post them on Instogram. Kousei: Hiuchidani-san, you and Nozomi use Instogram, don't you? Mei: I have an account, but I don't really post much. Nozomi: Same here. I mostly just use it to chat with my friends. But I'll try to get the word out to my classmates! Nozomi: Shirotaki Academy's not too far from here, so I can see a lot of them coming. Mei: Makihata's a bit further away, but I'll do my best to tell everyone there too! Kousei: Nice. That'd be great. Kousei: I suppose that means we'll need to make an official account for the cafe. Kousei: I've never used Instogram before. Is making an account easy? Mei: Yep! It's super easy. In fact, we could go ahead and do it right now. Kousei: Sure, let's do that. The sooner we set it up, the better. Mei: Speaking of, it might be a good idea to make a Facehook account too. Nozomi: Ohh, yeah. With a Facehook account, we can use it to connect to other sites as well. Mei: Whose e-mail address should we use to register? Kousei: Hmm... Nozomi: Can't we just use the cafe's one? Kousei: We have one? Mikado: Indeed. Allow me to borrow your phone for one moment. Mei: Sure. Here you go. Kousei: Wait, we actually have one?! Mikado: Naturally. I use it to exchange e-mails with our suppliers, for instance. Kanna: What?! That's the first I've heard of this! Mikado: You wouldn't know how to send an e-mail anyway. Kanna: Urk... E-Even if that's true, I think it's a little rude to assume things. Kanna: If I put my mind to it, I'm sure I could figure it out... Mei: Thanks. Now then, let's see. I'll put \"Cafe Stella\" as the name. Wait, or should it be in English? Nozomi: I think it's better to register in English. We can always write the description in Japanese later. Mei: Alright. Let's do that. Natsume: I guess I could try advertising the news around campus too. Kousei: I asked Hiroto to do the same, but I bet you'd attract a lot more attention. Suzune: I've printed flyers at my old workplace before. We can print quite a number of copies with just a few thousand yen. Suzune: But I'm not going to have to pay out of my own pocket, am I? Mikado: We can cover all the necessary costs, provided it isn't anything too unreasonable. Suzune: Great. In that case, I have one more idea. "

It's seriously delicious. Kousei: The aroma and flavor are really well balanced. Even better than it was before, and that's saying something. Natsume: Well, thanks. Natsume: But please forget about the whole moe moe kyun thing, and don't bring it up again. Kousei: And if I do? Natsume: I'll spank you. Natsume: Have you really forgotten? You and your dad were the ones who suggested I greet customers like this. Kousei: Hey, that was him, not me. Kousei: But, like, I thought you were totally against this cafe being a maid cafe. Natsume: I was at first, but after what you both said, I thought it wouldn't hurt to give it a try. Natsume: But on second thought, I really can't do this. It's almost like there's a second me standing behind my back, staring at me in contempt. Kousei: Yeah, I know that feeling. Natsume: I feel like a complete and utter idiot. Makes me want to crawl into a hole and die... Kousei: Well, it was pretty cute. Natsume: ...... Kousei: Okay, okay. I'm sorry. I wasn't trying to make fun of you, I swear, but I'll drop the subject. Kousei: Still, why are you wearing that outfit specifically? Kousei: Are you not happy with our current uniforms? I know they're a bit of a departure from the old ones... Natsume: I mean, it's tolerable... Natsume: To be honest, I hate how my legs are so exposed in it, but I don't regret changing the uniforms in and of itself. Natsume: It brightens up the atmosphere in the place, and we're drawing in more customers than I ever thought possible. I'm happy we did that, and I'm grateful to you for the idea. Kousei: But there's still some reason you wanted to wear that outfit over it, no? Natsume: Well, I guess... It's just a selfish desire... Kousei: Okay? Natsume: I want to wear something that'll make our customers happy, of course--but this is something I wanted to wear personally. Natsume: Anyway, this was just a little experiment. Forget about it, will you? Kousei: Easier said than done. Natsume: Alright, Master. It's time to add the final ingredient--moe! Please join me. Natsume: Now, together--moe, moe, kyun! Kousei: You know, the more you tell me to, the harder it is to erase from my mind... Natsume: Want me to forcibly erase it for you? Kousei: No, thank you. Please stop threatening to knock me in the head. Natsume: *sigh*... It feels like you've seen me doing the last thing I'd ever want you to see me doing. Kousei: Well, that was all you. Kousei: Just your imagination. Kousei: Anyway, back to what we were talking about--the whole moe moe kyun thing. Natsume: Did you literally not hear a word I said? Kousei: Wait, I'm not teasing you. I'm being serious here. Kousei: That whole maid cafe shtick honestly wasn't half-bad. Natsume: Then why'd you have such a lukewarm reaction when I did it... Kousei: Well, that's 'cause you wanted me to do it WITH you. Kinda took me out of the moment and made me ask myself what the hell we're doing. Kousei: Still, I can't say I didn't like it. I actually thought it was pretty cute.  Kousei: But then again, I am a guy. Natsume: Yeah, I know. Most of our customers are women anyway. So, with that in mind... Natsume: As of today, Cafe Stella's maid service will be shut down, terminated, and discontinued. Thank you for your patronage. Natsume: We will be resuming regular waitress operations from now on, but we hope you'll keep visiting us, Master. Natsume: There you have it. Kousei: Man, that's a shame. Kousei: I think you were onto something. It had a certain... charm to it. Natsume: No need to spare my feelings. Sorry you had to go along with this silly idea of mine. Kousei: That's okay. I asked you to go to the bar with me, so we're even. Natsume: I know; I haven't forgotten. Still, we probably shouldn't drink on an empty stomach. Why don't we have dinner together first? Kousei: Wait, what? D-Dinner? T-Together? Really? Kousei: I mean, I don't mind. At all. Sure. Yes. I would very much like to. Natsume: Urk. Why are you talking like that? It's honestly gross. Kousei: What do you want? I wasn't expecting a dinner invitation. Of course I sound nervous. Natsume: You're never going to be a chad at this rate, dude. Kousei: Stop bringing that up! Natsume: Well, now we're even. Kousei: Is it really that much fun, humiliating me? Natsume: Pretty fun, yeah. Natsume: Anyway, I'm going to get changed first. Kousei: Alright. I'll wait here. Kousei: ...... Kousei: This... isn't a dinner date. We're just a pair of friends eating together. Totally normal. Natsume: It's kind of a habit. I always go home, take a bath to relax, climb into bed to sleep--then it hits me. Natsume: \"Wait, did I remember to lock the door?\" Kousei: Yeah, I can relate. And once the thought gets into your head, it won't stop nagging at you. "

Seeing you work, chatting happily with your friends. Natsume's Mother: You looked like you were having so much fun, though, so we didn't want to interrupt. Natsume: ...... Natsume's Father: You had the biggest smile on your face, Natsume. Natsume: I-I was just-- Natsume's Father: It feels like it's been a while since we've seen you smile so brightly. Natsume's Father: Somewhere along the way, we started seeing less and less of that beautiful smile of yours. Natsume's Mother: As you've gotten older, all you've been doing is apologize to us. Natsume: I guess... Kousei: Sorry, I hate to interrupt. Kousei: But why don't we move this conversation inside? No reason to stand around out here. Natsume's Father: Yes, let's do that.

This tastes wonderful. Much better than anything I could ever make, at least. You did an amazing job. Natsume: That's ridiculous. You're the one who taught me everything I know, Dad. Natsume's Father: All I taught you were the basics. Natsume's Father: But the tea you're making now goes way beyond \"basic.\" Natsume's Father: You know, when the landlady first told us what you were doing, we had half a mind to stop you... but I feel silly for worrying now. Natsume's Mother: Absolutely. Natsume's Father: Listen, Natsume. There's something we've been meaning to say to you. Natsume's Mother: About this cafe. Natsume: Y-Yes? Natsume's Mother: I'll be blunt. Have you been under the impression that it's your fault that your father and I gave up on the cafe? Natsume: I mean, that's the truth, isn't it? Natsume's Father: It wasn't you. Natsume: But it had to be... Natsume's Father: Sure, we did have to put our plans of opening a cafe on hold. Natsume's Father: But that had nothing to do with your your health, Natsume. Natsume's Mother: Our dream was to quit the white-collar working life and open our own cafe. Natsume's Mother: In fact, we were more than ready to do so. Natsume's Father: But then all of a sudden, the global financial crisis hit. Natsume: Ah... I guess the timing does line up. Natsume's Mother: In other words, given our finances, we just decided it wasn't a very good time to start a new business. Natsume's Mother: Whether you were hospitalized or not, we would have given up on it either way. Natsume's Father: So because of that, we stayed at our jobs. But after a while, our minds began to clear. Natsume's Father: We realized that, truth be told, there wasn't any real need to rush into this cafe thing. Natsume's Mother: Exactly. We decided that we'd take it slow and save up more money. Nothing said we couldn't open the cafe after we retire. Natsume's Father: What we're trying to say is--while it was something we always wanted to do, it was also something we could give up on without hesitation. Natsume's Father: So you have nothing to blame yourself for, Natsume. Besides, we've never regretted our decision at all. Natsume's Mother: If anything, we might've actually regretted opening the cafe back then, instead of giving it more thought. Natsume's Father: Looking back, I'm honestly relieved we didn't act on the spur of the moment. Natsume: Oh... you are? Natsume: I never realized... Natsume: ...... Natsume: *sigh* Great... Then I guess this was all pointless, in the end. Just what have I been doing? Natsume's Father: How is this pointless? You've been working hard to make this dream of yours a reality, haven't you? Natsume: No, you don't understand. This cafe-- Natsume's Father: Is your dream, Natsume. You didn't do all of this for our sake. Natsume's Father: I can tell from the taste of your tea. You've put your heart and soul into this. Natsume's Mother: We understand better than anyone how tough it is running a cafe. Natsume's Mother: If this weren't really your dream, you wouldn't be working this hard. Natsume's Mother: Besides, didn't you see how much fun your guests were having today? Natsume: That's only because... they were my friends. Natsume's Father: Your regular customers enjoy themselves just as much, don't they? Natsume's Mother: Well, of course they do. Otherwise this place wouldn't be so bustling all the time. Natsume: Huh? Wait a second. Have you two been here before? Natsume's Father: Well, of course we have. Although, this is the first time we've ever actually come inside. Natsume's Mother: We were worried about you, so we came to see how you were doing, but one peek was all we needed. Natsume's Father: You were smiling so happily while you worked. Natsume: ...... Natsume's Mother: Opening this cafe may have been our dream, at first. Natsume's Mother: But now, it's yours. Natsume's Father: You made this a reality. Natsume's Father: You're amazing. Honestly, the truth is--we were afraid. That's why we were able to give up on it so easily. Natsume's Mother: While the recession was definitely a factor, in retrospect, we only used it as an excuse. Natsume's Father: But through your own hard work, you've turned this place into the best cafe ever, Natsume. Natsume: I... didn't really... Natsume's Father: As your parents, we couldn't be more proud of what you've achieved. In fact, we even admire you. Natsume's Mother: You worked hard, Natsume. Natsume: I didn't do it on my own, though... Natsume's Father: Maybe, but you managed to succeed at something we never could. Have some more confidence in yourself. Natsume's Father: And please, stop thinking that you need to atone for anything. Natsume's Father: You should be enjoying yourself more, working here. Like you were today. Natsume's Mother: We much prefer seeing you smile, after all. Natsume's Father: And we really are incredibly proud of you. Natsume's Mother: We're couldn't be more glad to have you as our daughter, Natsume. From the bottom of our hearts-- Natsume's Father & Mother: We love you. Natsume: ...... Natsume: Yeah... I know. Natsume: I love you too. Natsume: So? Natsume: How exactly are you going to compensate me for today? Kousei: Well, I'll let you cry into my chest if you want. Natsume: I'm not crying. Kousei: You sure? Looked like you were on the verge of tears earlier. Natsume: Shut up, and give me my compensation already. Kousei: ...... Kousei: I'm sorry. I'm sorry for keeping this a secret from you. I apologize. Please forgive me. Natsume: If you want me to forgive you, then close your eyes. And grit your teeth. Kousei: Okay. Natsume: I can't stay mad at you, after everything that happened. Even if you DID surprise me. Kousei: So you're not breaking up with me, after all? Natsume: I'll let you off the hook. This time. Kousei: Phew. I appreciate it. Natsume: Thank you for today. Really, I mean it. Natsume: I feel a weight's been lifted off my shoulders. Natsume: Knowing that everyone remembered the time we shared together, all those meaningless chats we had when we were kids... It feels good. Kousei: Looks like you weren't so insignificant to them after all. Natsume: I guess not. Kousei: So no more of that self-deprecation, alright? You'll make your parents sad too. Natsume: Yeah, I know. Natsume: Well, at least, now I do. Today, for the first time in my life, I learned just how much my mom and dad care about me. Natsume: Somewhere along the way... I started to think that it would have been better if someone else, someone healthier, had been born instead of me. Natsume: That's why I was always prepared to hear my parents say that about me. Kousei: But that wasn't the case. Natsume: They really do love me, don't they? Kousei: More than you know. Natsume: I thought I was prepared for anything they might say to me. Natsume: But this was... something I wasn't expecting at all. Natsume: Hearing how important I am to them made me really, really happy. Natsume: Yeah. I think it's the fragment of my soul that parted from me... Kousei: You're welcome. Natsume: Thank you for falling in love with me. Natsume: And thank you for being my boyfriend. Kousei: Does this mean I was able become a boyfriend you can be proud of? Natsume: Well, I don't know if I'd go THAT far. Kousei: Is it because of the surprises? Natsume: No. Because other women will start flirting with you if I start bragging about how great you are. Kousei: ...... Kousei: I'll take that as a compliment, I guess. Natsume: It was. Kousei: Ah. Kousei: Well, that's fine. As long as you're happy with me. Natsume: I am. Natsume: To be honest, I've fallen for you all over again. So from now on, I'm going to make sure that I'm the only woman who satisfies you. Kousei: You mean... sexually? Natsume: Well, in that sense too, I suppose. Kousei: ...... Natsume: What? Is that not what you want? Kousei: Oh, no, it is. Just busy imagining all the ways I'll have you \"satisfy\" me later. Natsume: *giggle* You're such an idiot. Natsume: But idiot or not, I still love you. "

The dough and fillings strike the perfect balance between sweet and savory! Visitor C: Pfft. What? Since when did you become some food connoisseur? Visitor D: Trust me. They're just that good.

Nozomi: Yeah. I'm ready. Kousei: I apologize in advance if I'm not very good at this, or I end up hurting you. Nozomi: I-It's okay. I'll try my best too. Let's do it. Kousei: So why don't I be bottom this time? Nozomi: O-Okay. Let's try that. Nozomi: This is what your thing looks like... Nozomi: It's so warm. Kousei: If you're too tense, it's only going to hurt more--or so I hear. Nozomi: Urk... How am I supposed to relax? It's my first time... Kousei: I know. To be honest, I'm kinda freaking out here too. Kousei: Sorry I don't know how to take the lead. Nozomi: Don't worry. Like I said, I'm glad you don't have a lot of experience with other girls.

So this is what happens when guys cum... Nozomi: I had no idea... Kousei: Don't stare at it so much. It's kind of embarrassing. Nozomi: Says the guy who wouldn't stop touching and playing with my boobs this whole time. Kousei: Heh. I guess you're right... Nozomi: Still... We've actually went all the way today... Kousei: Yeah.

Nozomi: Sorry. I just wanted to see how you'd react. Kousei: Hmph. Fine, I forgive you. But only because it's you. Nozomi: Ehehe. Thanks. You really do love me, don't you? Nozomi: Ah. It's the New Year's Bell. Kousei: Oh, wow. It's later than I thought. Kousei: Happy New Year, Nozomi. Nozomi: I feel so peaceful, hugging you like this... Nozomi: I think I might just fall asleep. Kousei: I'd like to sleep together tonight, but then your parents would definitely find out about us... Nozomi: Yeah. But honestly, I don't mind if they find out. Kousei: Do you think they'll approve of me dating you? Nozomi: I'm sure they will. But they'll probably end up asking you to take over the shrine, though... Nozomi: *yawn* I'm so tired... Kousei: Come on. You'll catch a cold if you sleep without any clothes on. Nozomi: Zzz... Zzz... Kousei: That was quick. Kousei: Phew... What a day. Kousei: It feels like I'm forgetting something important, though... Mei: *slurp*... Mhh! Soo good! That's Suzune-san's cooking for ya! Suzune: Thanks. There's plenty more if you want, so don't be afraid to ask for seconds. Kanna: Still, Takamine-san and Nozomi-san sure are running late. *slurp* Natsume: I sent both of them a message, but neither of them read it. Kanna: Wait. Do you think the two of them are doing, nihihi... \"you-know-what\"... right now? Suzune: Ahaha! Getting it on while listening to the New Year's Bell banishing the 108 worldly desires? Now wouldn't THAT be ironic! Kanna: Well, I doubt that's what they're actually doing! Ahaha! "

Kanna: And having said that, I am very happy to be dating you as well. However, I think it's important that we set down a few guidelines. Kousei: Good idea. Suzune-san might seriously get angry with us if we keep this up everyday. Kanna: Right. So let's decide on some ground rules first. Kousei: I guess the most important rule should be to prioritize our jobs while at work, including our morning prep and after-closing cleanup. Kousei: I know we can both agree on that much... but is there anything else you'd like to add, Kanna? Kanna: This is the first time you've ever dated a girl, isn't it? Kousei: Yeah. Why? Kanna: It's my first relationship too, so, to be perfectly honest, I have no idea how to actually \"date\", either. Kanna: Thus I'm worried that even though we see each other every day, we might not necessarily be spending that time as a couple. Kanna: So I was thinking... we could agree to set aside a certain amount of time when we can be together, just the two of us. Kousei: Yeah, that sounds good. I think that'd help me focus more while I'm at work too. Kanna: Okay. Why don't we make some time in the mornings before work to spend together? Kousei: The morning? Kanna: Is that a problem? Kousei: Well, not per se... but honestly, I don't know if I can wake up any earlier than I already do. Kanna: I thought you said you loved me. Is that all your \"love\" really amounts to? Kousei: Urk... No, I really do love you, I do, but... Kanna: But? Kousei: If I wake up any earlier than I do now, I'd be waking up before sunrise... so I'm not sure I'd be able to fully enjoy our time together. Kanna: ...... Kanna: Pfft. I'm only kidding. Nihihi. Kanna: To be honest, I'm not very good at waking up early either. If we want to spend time together, after work would be best. Kousei: Starting today... right? Kanna: Of course. Kousei: Alright. Any other rules we should decide on? Kanna: Hmm... I'm sure we'll think of more, the more time we spend with each other, so let's just cross that bridge when we get to it. Nozomi & Mei: Have a good night! Nozomi: The holiday season really is an absolute nightmare. Mei: Yeah. I'm about ready to pass out. Nozomi: At least we made it through Christmas. Mei: Yeah. We sold tons of cakes, and our customers all seemed super satisfied too. I think it's safe to say today was a success. Nozomi: Yep. Good job hanging in there, Mei-chan. Mei: You too, Nozomi-chan. Nozomi: Phew... Oh, I almost forgot. We'd better clean up before we get distracted. Suzune: Hold up. Before you go do that... Mei: Huh? What's that cake for? Nozomi: That's... not a leftover cake, is it? I thought we sold out today. Suzune: We did. This one's for us, though. Natsume: Even if we're working, it is still Christmas. We deserve to taste a bit of holiday cheer too. Mei: Is this really okay? Suzune: Of course. That's what I baked it for. Nozomi: But... won't you get in trouble for using ingredients without permission? Mikado: Hrmm. Mikado: I suppose it is fine every once in a while. Mei: Woohoo! Mikado: I must go see to the day's accounts. Try not to let your celebrations get out of hand. No doubt your families would be worried if you were to get home too late. Nozomi: Aren't you going to join us, Mikado-san? Mikado: I am not very fond of sweet desserts. Do not mind me, though. Go ahead and enjoy yourselves. Nozomi: Oh... Well, okay. Nozomi: Thanks for letting us do this, though. Natsume: He's right, though. We've still got to clean up, so we can't drag this out for too long. Suzune: Plus, we've got a couple of us here who are just dying to get out of here so they can spend some alone time on Christmas. Natsume: Very true. Mei: Oh, yeah. I hadn't thought of that. Nozomi: We wouldn't want to keep them. Ehehe. Kanna: ...... Kousei: That's okay. You don't have to-- Natsume: Come on. No need to beat around the bush. Nozomi: What she said, Kousei-kun. At times like this, it's best to be upfront with your desires. Mei: Yeah. Don't lie to yourself, Senpai! Kousei: Well, obviously we'd like to spend some time alone. Kousei: But we've already made those arrangements. Nozomi: Oh? That's unexpected. Kanna: You don't have to worry so much about us. Kanna: Enough of that--let's all have some cake! Mei: Don't mind if I do! Everyone: Merry Christmas, everyone! Kousei: Pardon me. Kanna: Yeah. I doubt there are many places open this late anyway. Kanna: Besides, it's a TGIF Christmas. Anywhere still open is bound to be completely full. Kousei: ...... Kanna: Hm? What's the matter? Kousei: TGIF? Kousei: Oh, I remember now. That's supposed to mean \"Thank God it's Friday,\" right? Kanna: Huh? Wait... Ah! Kanna: Urk... Kousei: You really do talk like a boomer, Kanna. Kanna: S-So what if the slang I use is a bit outdated? You still understood me, didn't you? Isn't that all that matters? Kousei: Took me a second, though. Kanna: Urk... Kousei: But yeah, it is a TGIF Christmas. I'm sure everyone's out there celebrating the end of the workweek, so it'll probably be crowded anywhere we go. Kanna: Why do you always make fun of me... Kousei: I'm not. It does kind of have a nice ring to it. TGIF Christmas. Kanna: Shut up. Kanna: I've got my own smartphone now. If you think I'm going to be stuck an out-of-touch boomer forever, then you've got another think coming! Kousei: Oh, come on. I never called you out-of-touch. But speaking of which-- Kousei: How's the phone going for you? Having any problems? Kanna: Not particularly. That being said, I only use it for a select few things. Kanna: Not that I regret buying it, though! I'm having a lot of fun using it to take pictures. Kousei: Oh, yeah. I noticed you using it today to take pictures of the cake Suzune-san made for us. Kanna: Would you like to see them? Kanna: Here! What do you think? They turned out quite well, if I do say so myself. Also, I've got some more too. Kousei: You're right. It looks delicious. Kousei: I-I really like this photo. The timing of the shot is pretty amazing. Kanna: Hehehe. What you're witnessing is the result of my daily progress. Kousei: Yeah, it was great. This was the first Christmas I've ever spent like that. Kousei: Well, when I was a kid, I'd either celebrate it at Nozomi's house or on my own. Kousei: These days, I guess I usually just celebrate with other guy friends. Which is still pretty fun, in its own way. Kousei: But because of that... Kanna: Hm? Kousei: Truth be told, I have no idea how I should celebrate Christmas with a girlfriend. Kanna: Well, you're not the only one. I have no clue what we're supposed to do either. Kanna: But we can just do whatever we're comfortable with, right? I don't think there's any need to copy what other people do.  Kousei: Yeah... I guess you're right. Kousei: This is only our second day dating, after all. It wouldn't make sense to compare ourselves to... other couples. Kanna: Exactly. If we wanted to do what everyone else was, then we'd be... Kanna: ...... Kousei: Ah. You were thinking about something sexual, weren't you? Kanna: No, I was no--well... I guess I can't deny it. Kanna: We are in fact a couple now. Kousei: Yeah, we are. It's only natural to think about those sorts of things... when you start dating someone. Kousei: I'd be lying if I said I wasn't having those thoughts either. Kousei: You don't want to? Kanna: Well. I think we should sit down and discuss this, first and foremost. Kousei: Discuss... what? Kanna: How do I say this... It... scares me, I think. Kousei: That's understandable. It's not easy for girls. Kanna: No, that's not what I mean. Urgh, how to best explain this... Kanna: I want to see you smiling while we're going out together, Kousei-san. And even when we have to part ways, I want you to be happy. Kanna: But... Kousei: You think it won't be in my best interest? Kanna: At the very least, I'm not confident it'll be a pleasant experience for you, since I'm a virgin. Kousei: I mean... I don't have any confidence in that area either. Kanna: I've just heard countless horror stories about people's first sexual experiences. Kousei: Well... Yeah, I'm sure you can find plenty of stories like that if you look for them. Kanna: So, well... hmm... what I'm trying to say is, like... Kanna: I'm just worried about... what kind of impression I'm going to leave you with, Kousei-san. Kousei: ...... Kanna: That being said... a part of me is scared about losing my virginity too, plain and simple. Kousei: Yeah, I get it. Kousei: Sort of. Kinda. Kanna: You do or you don't? Kousei: I can't say I can empathize with you completely. Kousei: But I do at least understand where you're coming from. Kousei: Basically... you're worried about the limited amount of time we have together. Kousei: If it ends up being a bad experience, that could sully the memories of our time together that I'm left with after you're gone. Kanna: Yes, exactly. Kousei: Then the answer's simple: we'll just make tons and tons of happy memories. Kousei: That way, even if there are a few unpleasant ones in the mix, I'll still be able to look back on them fondly. Kousei: Still, I can understand why you'd feel anxious jumping straight into it. Kousei: In that case--why don't we start with something like a picture? A picture of the two of us, using your phone. Kanna: Oh, I like that idea! Let's do it. Kanna: Hmm... I believe this is called a \"selfie,\" right? I turn on the front-facing camera, stretch out my arm... Come on, you need to get closer or you'll be cut out of frame. Kousei: R-Right. Kanna: Alright, I'm taking it. Say cheese! Kanna: Ah! D-Don't tell me that was boomer lingo too?! Do people even still say cheese nowadays?! Kousei: I-I dunno. I guess? Kousei: To be honest, I don't get my picture taken very often. There might be other things people say, but I can't really think of anything else at the moment... Kanna: Well, that's fine... Kanna: Okay, I'm taking the picture for real this time. Say cheese! Kanna: It's gotten rather late, hasn't it? Are you sure you'll be able to wake up in time for work tomorrow? Kousei: Yeah. I'm gonna go straight to bed once I get back. Kanna: Good idea. Make sure to keep yourself warm so you don't catch a cold. Kanna: Also, please be careful on your way home. Kousei: I will. Kousei: Oh, I almost forgot. Thanks for the gloves. They're super warm. Kanna: You're very welcome. Kousei: Well then-- Kousei: ...... Kanna: Hmm? Kousei-san? Kousei: Kanna... Kanna: Yes? Kousei: May I, um... give you a kiss? Kanna: ...... Kousei: Err, I'm not trying to bring up our discussion from earlier again. Kousei: It would be our first kiss... so it's probably going to leave a pretty strong impression, I know. Kousei: But since it's just a kiss, I don't think there's much risk of it going wrong or being an unpleasant experience, so... Kousei: Pretty please? That's not too much to ask from my girlfriend, is it? Kanna: H-Hrmm... Well... If you want to kiss THAT badly... Kanna: After much deliberation, I suppose a kiss would be... acceptable. Kousei: Alright then. Kanna: Umm... What exactly does a kiss feel like? Kousei: I wouldn't know. Kanna: You don't have to answer so bluntly... Kousei: I mean, we'll find out for ourselves either way. Kanna: Well, I get that, but still. Kousei: It's probably not that big of a deal. Kanna: Y-Yeah. All we're essentially doing is putting our lips together. Kanna: That's all it is... right? Kousei: ...... Kanna: Nhh! Nhh... mhh... Kousei: Ngh... Kousei: *pant* *pant*... Kanna: I mean... it would've been embarrassing to breathe all over you... Kousei: Yeah, that would've been... Yeah. Kousei: It was... kind of amazing. Kousei: What did you think? Kanna: I agree. It was... kind of amazing. Kanna: So amazing that... Kanna: Ahmph... Nh, mhh... Kanna: Ahmph, mhh... Nh, nhh... Kousei: D-Did you just... Kanna: ...... Kanna: I'm... going back inside. See you tomorrow. Kousei: Y-Yeah, see you. "

I thought you enjoyed the reunion. Natsume: I did. Natsume: It was a relief to find out I wasn't the only one, honestly... After all these years, it feels like a weight's been lifted off my chest. Natsume: So thank you. Kousei: Glad I could help. Natsume: But that still doesn't mean I forgive you for surprising me. Kousei: I thought not. Natsume: I wish you would've just told me you were planning this from the start. Kousei: I did consider it, of course. Kousei: But if I did that, I feel like you would've chickened out. Natsume: Ngh... I guess I can't deny that. Natsume: Actually, come to think of it, didn't you say there were two more people coming to the reunion? Kousei: Well, now that you mention it... Natsume: This better not be another surprise. Kousei: Wait. I really don't know what's happening this time. Kousei: They said they were going to come, I swear. Natsume: Just who else did you invite? Kousei: Err-- Natsume's Father: Natsume. Natsume: Dad? Mom? Natsume's Mother: Hi! Natsume: Don't tell me they were who you were referring to... Natsume's Mother: We were watching you the whole time. Seeing you work, chatting happily with your friends. Natsume's Mother: You looked like you were having so much fun, though, so we didn't want to interrupt. Natsume: ...... Natsume's Father: You had the biggest smile on your face, Natsume. Natsume: I-I was just-- Natsume's Father: It feels like it's been a while since we've seen you smile so brightly. Natsume's Father: Somewhere along the way, we started seeing less and less of that beautiful smile of yours. Natsume's Mother: As you've gotten older, all you've been doing is apologize to us. Natsume: I guess... Kousei: Sorry, I hate to interrupt. Kousei: But why don't we move this conversation inside? No reason to stand around out here. Natsume's Father: Yes, let's do that. Natsume's Mother: I'd love to try some of your tea, Natsume! Natsume: Here is your Darjeeling tea. Natsume's Mother: Thank you. Natsume's Father: Now then, let's give this a try. Natsume: Huh? Wh-What is it? Did I get something wrong? Natsume's Mother: Oh, not at all, dear. Just the opposite, in fact. This is delicious. Natsume's Father: Such wonderful flavor and aroma. This tastes wonderful. Much better than anything I could ever make, at least. You did an amazing job. Natsume: That's ridiculous. You're the one who taught me everything I know, Dad. Natsume's Father: All I taught you were the basics. Natsume's Father: But the tea you're making now goes way beyond \"basic.\" Natsume's Father: You know, when the landlady first told us what you were doing, we had half a mind to stop you... but I feel silly for worrying now. Natsume's Mother: Absolutely. Natsume's Father: Listen, Natsume. There's something we've been meaning to say to you. Natsume's Mother: About this cafe. Natsume: Y-Yes? Natsume's Mother: I'll be blunt. Have you been under the impression that it's your fault that your father and I gave up on the cafe? Natsume: I mean, that's the truth, isn't it? Natsume's Father: It wasn't you. Natsume: But it had to be... Natsume's Father: Sure, we did have to put our plans of opening a cafe on hold. Natsume's Father: But that had nothing to do with your your health, Natsume. Natsume's Mother: Our dream was to quit the white-collar working life and open our own cafe. Natsume's Mother: In fact, we were more than ready to do so. Natsume's Father: But then all of a sudden, the global financial crisis hit. Natsume: Ah... I guess the timing does line up. Natsume's Mother: In other words, given our finances, we just decided it wasn't a very good time to start a new business. Natsume's Mother: Whether you were hospitalized or not, we would have given up on it either way. Natsume's Father: So because of that, we stayed at our jobs. But after a while, our minds began to clear. Natsume's Father: We realized that, truth be told, there wasn't any real need to rush into this cafe thing. Natsume's Mother: Exactly. We decided that we'd take it slow and save up more money. Nothing said we couldn't open the cafe after we retire. Natsume's Father: What we're trying to say is--while it was something we always wanted to do, it was also something we could give up on without hesitation. Natsume's Father: So you have nothing to blame yourself for, Natsume. Besides, we've never regretted our decision at all. Natsume's Mother: If anything, we might've actually regretted opening the cafe back then, instead of giving it more thought. Natsume's Father: Looking back, I'm honestly relieved we didn't act on the spur of the moment. Natsume: Oh... you are? Natsume: I never realized... Natsume: ...... Natsume: *sigh* Great... Then I guess this was all pointless, in the end. Just what have I been doing? Natsume's Father: How is this pointless? You've been working hard to make this dream of yours a reality, haven't you? Natsume: No, you don't understand. This cafe-- Natsume's Father: Is your dream, Natsume. You didn't do all of this for our sake. Natsume's Father: I can tell from the taste of your tea. You've put your heart and soul into this. Natsume's Mother: We understand better than anyone how tough it is running a cafe. Natsume's Mother: If this weren't really your dream, you wouldn't be working this hard. Natsume's Mother: Besides, didn't you see how much fun your guests were having today? Natsume: That's only because... they were my friends. Natsume's Father: Your regular customers enjoy themselves just as much, don't they? Natsume's Mother: Well, of course they do. Otherwise this place wouldn't be so bustling all the time. Natsume: Huh? Wait a second. Have you two been here before? Natsume's Father: Well, of course we have. Although, this is the first time we've ever actually come inside. Natsume's Mother: We were worried about you, so we came to see how you were doing, but one peek was all we needed. Natsume's Father: You were smiling so happily while you worked. Natsume: ...... Natsume's Mother: Opening this cafe may have been our dream, at first. Natsume's Mother: But now, it's yours. Natsume's Father: You made this a reality. Natsume's Father: You're amazing. Honestly, the truth is--we were afraid. That's why we were able to give up on it so easily. Natsume's Mother: While the recession was definitely a factor, in retrospect, we only used it as an excuse. Natsume's Father: But through your own hard work, you've turned this place into the best cafe ever, Natsume. Natsume: I... didn't really... Natsume's Father: As your parents, we couldn't be more proud of what you've achieved. In fact, we even admire you. Natsume's Mother: You worked hard, Natsume. Natsume: I didn't do it on my own, though... Natsume's Father: Maybe, but you managed to succeed at something we never could. Have some more confidence in yourself. Natsume's Father: And please, stop thinking that you need to atone for anything. Natsume's Father: You should be enjoying yourself more, working here. Like you were today. Natsume's Mother: We much prefer seeing you smile, after all. Natsume's Father: And we really are incredibly proud of you. Natsume's Mother: We're couldn't be more glad to have you as our daughter, Natsume. From the bottom of our hearts-- Natsume's Father & Mother: We love you. Natsume: ...... Natsume: Yeah... I know. Natsume: I love you too. Natsume: So? Natsume: How exactly are you going to compensate me for today? Kousei: Well, I'll let you cry into my chest if you want. Natsume: I'm not crying. Kousei: You sure? Looked like you were on the verge of tears earlier. Natsume: Shut up, and give me my compensation already. Kousei: ...... Kousei: I'm sorry. I'm sorry for keeping this a secret from you. I apologize. Please forgive me. Natsume: If you want me to forgive you, then close your eyes. And grit your teeth. Kousei: Okay. Natsume: I can't stay mad at you, after everything that happened. Even if you DID surprise me. Kousei: So you're not breaking up with me, after all? Natsume: I'll let you off the hook. This time. Kousei: Phew. I appreciate it. Natsume: Thank you for today. Really, I mean it. Natsume: I feel a weight's been lifted off my shoulders. Natsume: Knowing that everyone remembered the time we shared together, all those meaningless chats we had when we were kids... It feels good. Kousei: Looks like you weren't so insignificant to them after all. Natsume: I guess not. Kousei: So no more of that self-deprecation, alright? You'll make your parents sad too. Natsume: Yeah, I know. Natsume: Well, at least, now I do. Today, for the first time in my life, I learned just how much my mom and dad care about me. Natsume: Somewhere along the way... I started to think that it would have been better if someone else, someone healthier, had been born instead of me. Natsume: That's why I was always prepared to hear my parents say that about me. Kousei: But that wasn't the case. Natsume: They really do love me, don't they? Kousei: More than you know. Natsume: I thought I was prepared for anything they might say to me. Natsume: But this was... something I wasn't expecting at all. Natsume: Hearing how important I am to them made me really, really happy. Natsume: Yeah. I think it's the fragment of my soul that parted from me... Kousei: You're welcome. Natsume: Thank you for falling in love with me. Natsume: And thank you for being my boyfriend. Kousei: Does this mean I was able become a boyfriend you can be proud of? Natsume: Well, I don't know if I'd go THAT far. Kousei: Is it because of the surprises? Natsume: No. Because other women will start flirting with you if I start bragging about how great you are. Kousei: ...... Kousei: I'll take that as a compliment, I guess. Natsume: It was. Kousei: Ah. Kousei: Well, that's fine. As long as you're happy with me. Natsume: I am. Natsume: To be honest, I've fallen for you all over again. So from now on, I'm going to make sure that I'm the only woman who satisfies you. Kousei: You mean... sexually? Natsume: Well, in that sense too, I suppose. Kousei: ...... Natsume: What? Is that not what you want? Kousei: Oh, no, it is. Just busy imagining all the ways I'll have you \"satisfy\" me later. Natsume: *giggle* You're such an idiot. Natsume: But idiot or not, I still love you. "

You did see it, didn't you? Didn't you? Yes, you. I'm talking to you. Kousei: You'll never take me alive, demon! Natsume: Who are you calling a demon?! Kousei: Relax, I'm kidding. I didn't see anything THAT bad. I mean, at least you had your clothes on this time. Natsume: Just because I'm clothed doesn't mean you're allowed to spy on me! Natsume: Now stop trying to run! Kousei: Ahhhhh! Somebody heeelp! Kousei: Don't glare at me like that... Kousei: Is it really even my fault this time? Natsume: Yes. You were peeking in through the crack in the door. Kousei: Can't deny that... Kousei: But you were the one who left the door half-open. Kousei: Why were you practicing your smile in here by yourself anyway? Kousei: I thought you were going to ask Hiuchidani-san to coach you. Natsume: She tried to... but her explanations were all based on \"feelings,\" so it was kind of hard to follow. Mei: First, try remembering something fun that you did. Mei: Next, think about how you felt back then, and let that feeling build. Mei: Then let it build... And build and build... Until it can't build no more... Then you KEEP building... And finally, you let it all out! Mei: Welcome to Cafe Stella! Kousei: ...... Kousei: I, um... sort of get what she was trying to say. Kousei: Ah, so that's why you were practicing in the mirror. Kousei: You didn't seem very satisfied with the results, though. Natsume: I don't know why, but it always ends up looking unnatural... Kousei: Isn't it because you're so pretty? Natsume: Excuse you? Kousei: That's exactly what I mean. Natsume: What are you talking about? Kousei: That ice-cold glare. On a girl with your looks, it's even more attractive than a smile. Natsume: Ugh... You're such a creep. Kousei: Okay, I know. Here's the thing. Kousei: I'm willing to bet it's been a long time since you've smiled as broadly as Hiuchidani-san. Kousei: Maybe you never even have. And if that's the case, you aren't going to master the art of smiling in one or two weeks. Natsume: W-Well... Kousei: But if we wait for you to get there, we're going to miss our October deadline. Kousei: If there's something you can't do, it's best just to admit it. Natsume: Not beating around the bush, are you? Kousei: Instead of trying to do what you can't, you should focus on doing what you can. Kousei: So greet our customers with what feels natural to you. That's what I suggest. Natsume: But my smile isn't good enough for the cafe's bright new atmosphere. Kousei: That's not true. Kousei: I think your smile is plenty attractive. Natsume: You're just saying that. Kousei: No, I actually mean it. Kousei: Remembering something fun that you did might help you form a more natural smile. Natsume: Something fun... something fun... Natsume: ...... Natsume: I don't know... I can't really think of anything. Kousei: When the cafe finally opens, we're gonna have a ton of customers enjoying themselves. Try imagining that. Natsume: O-Okay. Imagine... imagine... Natsume: Welcome to Cafe Stella! Kousei: ...... Natsume: What? Was it really that appalling? Kousei: Oh, no. I'm just speechless at how good it was. Natsume: Tch. Kousei: I'm serious. The future of the cafe hinges on this, so I wouldn't lie. Kousei: The smile you just made wasn't out of place at all. I'm sure you'll get the hang of it by the time we open. Natsume: Hmm... Well, I'll try to keep this up then. Kousei: Okay, I'm leaving. I'll make sure to close the door properly too. Natsume: Good. Kousei: Yeah? Natsume: Thank you. Kousei: No problem. Kousei: Oh, Nozomi. Just the person I wanted to see, actually. Nozomi: Sorry. I just remembered something I have to do, so I'll come back later! Kousei: Wait, don't go. It's not anything weird. I just have a normal favor to ask of you. Nozomi: And how many times have you tricked me with that very line? One, two, three... Kousei: Stop counting your fingers. Kousei: Listen, Nozomi. Look into my eyes. Nozomi: It's like I'm staring into two muddy pools. Kousei: Look closer. Kousei: I'd never try to trick you, Nozomi. Nozomi: Kousei-kun... Nozomi: How many times have you tried to use that one to sweet-talk your way out of things? Let's see... Kousei: Stop counting! Kousei: I'm not trying to trick you or anything. I was just thinking of practicing my waitering skills, so I wanted your help. I need someone to play the customer. Nozomi: Oh, is that all? Kousei: Great. Kousei: Welcome to Cafe Stella. Party of one? Nozomi: Yes. Kousei: Would a seat at the counter be okay? Nozomi: I'd prefer to sit at that table over there. Is that alright? Kousei: Of course. However, do note that we may have to ask you to move if a large party of customers comes in... Nozomi: That's fine. Kousei: Thank you. Now please, follow me. Kousei: Here's a menu. Once you've decided on your order, please let me know. Nozomi: Can I get a blend coffee, to start? Kousei: Certainly. Nozomi: Pfft. Ahaha! This is so weird! Kousei: What? Did I mess something up? Nozomi: Nope, there's nothing wrong with your service. It's just so funny seeing you act super courteous towards me. Nozomi: Still, I kind of like having you at my beck and call! Kousei: So you've finally warmed up to the idea of being my sugar mama, eh? Nozomi: No, thank you. I'll have to pass on that one. Nozomi: Now quit fooling around and bring me my coffee. Kousei: Talk about a hard-to-please customer. Nozomi: We're bound to get all kinds of people in here, so you'd better learn how to deal with one. Nozomi: C'mon! Stop slackin' off, ya bum! Hurry up and bring me my coffee! Kousei: Oh, fine. Nozomi: Is that any way to respond to a customer? Kousei: Yes, ma'am. I shall have it ready momentarily. Nozomi: Good. Ehehe. Mei: Oh? Do you need something, Senpai? Kousei: Just popping in to see how things are going. Kousei: Everything alright? Then again, you're honestly probably the last person I need to be concerned about, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Hey, that's not true. Even I have some things I'm not confident at. Kousei: Oh, that's a surprise. What kind of things? Mei: Everything aside from customer service. Kousei: If you're worried about brewing coffee or tea, you'll do fine as long as you follow Shiki-san's recipes. Kousei: It's just a matter of repetition. Keep doing it till you can do it in your sleep. Mei: Well, I was a little worried about that... but mostly, it's the parfaits I'm having trouble with. Kousei: Didn't I give you the recipe last time? Kousei: It's basically just arranging the ingredients. Mei: That's the problem. I'm super clumsy, so I've never even cooked a simple meal before. Kousei: Well, practice makes perfect. Kousei: Actually, why don't we practice right now? Mei: It's simple enough to remove all the strawberry stems. Mei: Next we add the cornflakes, then a layer of fresh cream, right? Mei: I know that much, at least... Mei: But when it comes to squeezing out the cream, I always end up using too much force. Mei: Making it look nice is really hard... Mngh... Hngh... Aww, crap. I overshot it again. Mei: Isn't there an easier way to do this? Kousei: Hmm. When I learned how to use a pastry bag, I think I was taught a trick. Kousei: It's important to relax your grip completely. Kousei: Also, remember to lift the bag straight up when you're adding the finishing touch. That way you don't mess up the nice swirl you made. Mei: Okay. Relax, lift straight up... Relax, lift straight up... Kousei: But honestly, each layer of cream is going to have strawberries on top anyway, so it doesn't need to look perfect. Mei: Strawberries, cream... Strawberries, cream... Mngh... Mei: Ahh... Phew. Does that look good? Mei: Hm? Senpai? What's the matter? Kousei: Oh, err... Mei: ...... Mei: Ah! Ahh?! Mei: Ahhhhh! Mei: O-Oh God... I screwed up again! Mei: But it's your fault this time, Senpai. You big perv! Kousei: Err, I didn't-- Mei: Didn't what? Kousei: Never mind. I'm sorry. Please forgive me. Mei: Mghh... Well... I guess I was being a bit careless too, so I won't blame you. Mei: But a boy... a boy saw my boobs! My precious first time... Mei: Does this mean I can't get married anymore? Kousei: That's way too much of an exaggeration. Mei: Well, I hope you're right... Kousei: Besides, I didn't even see anything. All I caught was a glimpse of your collarbone and your bra strap. That's it. Just a tiny peek. Mei: That doesn't make me feel any better, Senpai. If anything, you sound like even more of a perv. Kousei: Yeah... Kousei: Anyway, I'm sorry. Mei: You don't have to keep apologizing. It wasn't all your fault, Senpai. Mei: But, um, was it really was just the tip of my bra? You didn't see anything lower down... like a slip of pink, did you? Kousei: No, I did not, unfortunately. Mei: Oh. W-Well, umm... I guess that's okay... Maybe? Urk... but I'm still so embarrassed.. Kousei: ...... Mei: And you also have to let me practice this one more time! Then we both forget this little incident ever happened! Kousei: Fine by me. Mei: Good. Then it's settled! Kousei: Alright. Kousei: Hey. I just wanted to follow up on that favor I asked you about. Hiroto: Oh, that? Don't worry, I didn't forget. I talked to my sis about it. Hiroto: She didn't seem too interested, though, like I thought. I tried kicking her off her ass time and time again, but nothing. Hiroto: Given her situation, my parents aren't too keen about forcing her back to work... Kousei: I see... Hiroto: Sorry, pal. Kousei: Nah, it's fine. We shouldn't force her. Kousei: But could you do one more thing for me? Hiroto: More trouble? Kousei: Relax, it won't take long. Kousei: I want your sister to come check out our cafe. "

            "Somei: I'll try to be more positive. I feel like people tend to worry too much about contacting old friends, only to find out it's no big deal once they actually do it. Kousei: True. Somei: Don't you have to get back to work, though? Kousei: Oh, crap! I forgot! Somei: Speaking of the cafe, I wouldn't say no to a slice of cake next time you visit! Kousei: Well, I guess. But I thought you were about to be discharged soon? Somei: Yeah, I am. Kousei: In that case, you might as well come by the cafe yourself. Somei: Ahh, sure. I'll think about it. Kousei: By the way, do you think I could get your phone number? Somei: Oh-ho! And you said you're not a cheater. She's not gonna be happy to hear this! Kousei: Please don't joke about that. She can be seriously scary when she gets mad. Somei: Why do you want my number then? Oh, are you gonna introduce me to one of your guy friends? Kousei: Hmm. Well, if you're serious, I guess I could introduce you to one of my college buddies. Somei: Wait. Seriously? Kousei: Sure, it's not that big of a deal. Kousei: I won't ask you to do anything for me in return... but maybe you'd be willing to give me some advice? Natsume: How does kissing feel so good? All we're doing is putting our lips together... Natsume: If this is what kissing feels like, then... Female Nurse: Oh? Has your boyfriend already left? Natsume: He came here during his break at work, so he couldn't stay long. Female Nurse: You're a lucky girl. Not many guys would come see their girlfriend every day of the week. Natsume: ...... Female Nurse: Oh, no need to blush. Female Nurse: There's no reason a pretty girl like you shouldn't have a man or two around her arm. You might not think it, but I was quite the playgirl back in my younger days. Natsume: I'm fine with just the one, actually. Female Nurse: Oh, you're more pure-hearted than I expected. Natsume: Anyway, um... there's something I'd like to ask. Female Nurse: What's that? Natsume: If I leave the hospital tomorrow as scheduled, will I be able to go back to my life as usual? Female Nurse: Well, yes. Natsume: So I should be able to take hot baths, and engage in a bit of... ph-physical activity? Female Nurse: That shouldn't be a problem. But it'll also depend on what kind of physical activity you... Female Nurse: Ahh. So THAT'S what you mean. Female Nurse: Most girls your age are interested in those things, all the more so if they have a boyfriend. Heck, back in my younger days, I-- Natsume: Ngh! Female Nurse: Well, maybe another time. But I get it--you can't exactly ask Dr. Miyama a question like that. Alright. I'll try to ask him for you as discreetly as I can. Natsume: I'd, um, appreciate that... Female Nurse: Oh, how I wish I was young like you again. Kousei: ...... Suzune: Try relaxing a bit more, will you? Kousei: Easier said than done. I can't help but worry. Kanna: Did the tests come back okay? Kousei: Yeah, that's what she texted me. Said she was clear to be discharged today. Suzune: Alright. The caprese-style pasta's ready to go out. Kanna: I'll take it. Kanna: Here is your caprese-style pasta. I'll bring you your sachertorte and blend coffee once you've finished. Kanna: Please, enjoy your meal. Mikado: Welcome to Cafe Stella. Hm? Ah, if it isn't Shiki Natsume. Natsume: Hello. Mei: Huh? Oh, it's Natsume-senpai! Welcome back! Nozomi: Welcome back! Natsume: Oh, I didn't know you two were working today. Nozomi: They needed some extra help till you got back. Mei: Plus, we wanted to be here to see you! Boy, I ran here as fast as I could once school let out. Natsume: Ah. Thanks for doing that. Mei: Oh, you don't have to thank us for that! Ahaha. Mei: We've missed you a whole lot this past week. Nozomi: Since they let you out, does that mean you're all good to go now? Natsume: Yeah. I'm fine. Nozomi: Are you sure? You weren't in the hospital for as long as I thought you'd be. Kanna: Health and sickness start with the mind, after all. I'm sure those daily visits from a certain somebody did wonders to speed her recovery. Nozomi & Mei: Ahh. Natsume: You didn't have to say that out loud. Kanna: Welcome back, Natsume-san. Mikado: Welcome back. Natsume: Thanks. I'll be able to get back to work by tomorrow. Mei: What? So soon? You can rest up a little longer, if you need to. Nozomi: Yeah. If you need any help settling back into things, just ask! We're all here for you! Natsume: I will. Thank you, everyone. Kanna: But that's enough about work. You're here as a customer today, aren't you? Mei: Table for one, Miss? Suzune: Ah, look who it is. I had a feeling that's what all the commotion was about. Suzune: Welcome back, Natsume-san. Natsume: Mhm. I'm glad to be back. Kousei: Make it non-alcoholic, please. Bartender: Certainly. Kousei: You okay after all that? I'm surprised you don't have heartburn. Natsume: A small price to pay. Humans can't live without eating good food. Kousei: You seem like you're in a good mood. Natsume: Maybe it's because I just got out of the hospital, but everything tasted so delicious. Kousei: Because... of me? Natsume: Nope. Not quite. Natsume: Not just because of you, but because of everyone. Kousei: You mean everyone at the cafe? Natsume: Yeah. I don't want to sound like I'm still hung up on this, though. Kousei: Don't worry. I'm here to listen. Natsume: See, years ago, whenever I was released from the hospital... people would always stare at me from a distance. Natsume: They didn't exactly treat me like I was helpless, but they always seemed confused, like they didn't know what to say to me. Natsume: And that's why... Bartender: Here you are, ma'am. Kousei: Stop joking about that. Kousei: If it turns out there's actually alcohol in there, I'm going to start worrying about you again. Natsume: Okay, okay. Sorry. I'll stop for today. Kousei: Alright. Let's get you home now. Natsume: ...... Kousei: Natsume? Natsume: Nothing... Kousei: Okay? Kousei: Oh, yeah. Finals are coming up. You feeling confident? You've been pretty busy lately, so you probably haven't had much time to study. Natsume: Well, I'm sure I'll manage. Kousei: Why don't we study together sometime for the class we share? Natsume: Sure. I don't mind. Kousei: ...... Natsume: ...... Kousei: ...... Kousei: What's the matter? Kousei: ...... Kousei: Haha, very funny. I thought I told you to stop joking ar-- Natsume: I'm not joking. And I'm not drunk either. Kousei: ...... Natsume: I want to stay with you... a bit longer... Kousei: Ah, er, sorry. Yeah... Kousei: I just never expected this, so my mind's kinda going haywire right now. So, um... Kousei: Alright. Kousei: I want to be with you too, Natsume. Kousei: *pant*... *pant*... Kousei: ...... Kousei: Nghhh! Kousei: *inhale*... *exhale*... *inhale*... *exhale*... *inhale*... Kousei: %123;*choke*?! Kousei: Er, no. 'Course not. Kousei: *inhale*... *exhale*... Kousei: You look really sexy. Natsume: Ngh... Kousei: Err, sorry. That was supposed to be a compliment. Y-You're not mad, are you? Natsume: No, I'm not. It's just... incredibly embarrassing. Kousei: You really look beautiful, though. Positively stunning. I'm getting turned on just looking at you. Kousei: My bad. Kousei: But, err, instead of that... Kousei: Can I... touch you? Natsume: Are you really going to ask me that now? Take a hint. Kousei: Yeah. Sorry. Natsume: It's my first time, so we need to do a bit more foreplay first. You know, kissing, stuff like that... Kousei: R-Right. Sorry. Kissing... Nhh... Natsume: I wasn't saying for you to kiss me down THERE! Kousei: Huh? Natsume: Why are you surprised?! Is this really news to you?! There's an order to this stuff! Kousei: O-Oh. Sorry. You're right. First things first. Kousei: Please tell me your name and age. Natsume: What am I, interviewing for the casting couch? Natsume: Oh, for crying out loud. You totally ruined the mood now. Natsume: I hope you know how humiliating this is for me. Kousei: I'm sorry. I mean it. I apologize. Kousei: But you gotta understand; this is my first time too! I'm freaking out here! Natsume: Then make it up to me. Nhh... Natsume: Nhhh... Nh, mh... Nhh... Ah... That's the first time. Kousei: Huh? Natsume: The first time you've ever initiated a kiss. Kousei: Yeah, I guess so. Kousei: I'd better pay you back for all the times you've kissed me then... Nhh... Natsume: Ahmph... Hngh... *smack* *kiss*... Nhh... Nh... *kiss* *smooch*... Mhh... Kousei: No, they're perfect. And... super soft. Natsume: Ahh, nhh... Hngh... Nhhh... Kousei: Besides, it doesn't matter whether they're big or small. I don't care about size. Natsume: Is that supposed to be a compliment? Kousei: I dunno, to be honest. I think your boobs might be hypnotizing me. Kousei: They're so soft... and your nipples are such a beautiful pink too... It's really turning me on. Natsume: Well, um, I'm glad to hear it. Kousei: ...... Natsume: Stop staring at me in silence, will you? It's embarrassing. Kousei: Sorry, I didn't mean to. Kousei: *lick* *suck*... Your nipples are delicious, Natsume... Natsume: *pant* *pant*... It didn't hurt... Nhh... *pant*... Natsume: I just didn't expect it to feel this electrifying... *pant*... *pant*... Natsume: What's going to happen to me... if we go even further? Kousei: I don't know either. Kousei: But... I'm past the point of return. Kousei: It's... so pretty... Kousei: Well, I need to get a good look. Kousei: Don't wanna put it in the wrong hole, y'know... Natsume: Yeah, but... It doesn't look weird, does it? Kousei: It's beautiful. Seriously. That's the only word that comes to mind. Kousei: Is that not convincing enough for you? Natsume: No, I never said that... *pant* *pant*... *pant*... Urk... You're just staring so hard... Kousei: ...... Natsume: And now you go all quiet on me again. Kousei: Ah, err, sorry. I'm not doing it on purpose. I just can't tear my eyes away... Natsume: *pant*... *pant*... *pant*... *pant*... Kousei: Your vagina's so amazing. Natsume: Huh? What do you mean? Does it look weird? Kousei: No, of course not. Kousei: It's just, this is my first time doing any of this... All I can say is, it's amazing. Natsume: R-Really? Umm, how else would you describe it? Kousei: Let's see... Natsume: Delicious? What are you... N-No, wait. You're... Don't tell me you're... Ahh! Kousei: Nhh... *smooch* Natsume: Ngghhh?! Kousei: Your pussy? Natsume: Ngh! Don't say it outright! Natsume: You didn't hate putting your mouth on my p-pu... did you? You don't have to force yourself. Kousei: I don't hate it one bit. I love every part of you, Natsume. If anything, I want to lick it even more. Kousei: What about you, though? Do you not want me to lick it? Natsume: It's just... embarrassing. That's the worst part... but I don't mind it. Kousei: Alright. In that case... Natsume: Ahh?! Nghh... Mhh... Urk... Ahh! Kousei: *lick* *lick*... *slurp* Natsume: S-Sto... Not there... Ahh! It's too embarrassing... being licked there... Nhh! Natsume: Ah, *pant* *pant*... Do people usually have to go this far? Kousei: *lick... Not that I'd know... but I'm pretty sure this is a normal part of foreplay. Natsume: I'm just a little worried that you're getting most of your information from porn. Kousei: Well, judging from your reactions, it seems like you like this. Natsume: I mean... Kousei: Can I keep kissing you down here? I want to taste you even more, Natsume. Natsume: You promise you'll stop? Kousei: Sure... If I can pump the brakes in time. Kousei: But sorry in advance if I can't stop myself. I'm already on the verge of losing control as is. Kousei: *lick*... *lick* *slurp*... *kiss* *kiss*... *suck*... Natsume: Ahhh... Ahh, ah, ah... ahhh... Eeek?! Natsume: Ahhh?! Ahh... ah, ah, ah, ahhh! Kousei: I just tried focusing my kisses on a specific spot... *kiss* *suck* *kiss* *lick*... Natsume: Ahhh! W-Wait, not there... Noooo! My body's... tingling so much... Ahhh! Kousei: Nhh... Does it hurt? Natsume: It doesn't hurt, but I'm scared of how much my body's tingling. Kousei: Does that mean you want me to stop? Natsume: No, but... *pant* *pant*... A-Are you going to keep kissing me? Kousei: I thought you said you were scared? Natsume: I... I am... but you want to keep going, don't you? Kousei: Of course. But if you don't want me to, I won't; I'll stop here. Kousei: So tell me what you want, Natsume. Natsume: Urk... I-I know you already know what I'm going to say... Natsume: You're teasing me on purpose, aren't you? Kousei: That's not--completely untrue, I guess. Natsume: Nrgh... Kousei: But I don't want to do anything you don't like. That's the truth. Kousei: That's why I want you to say it clearly. Because once we go any further, I get the feeling I won't be able to stop myself. Natsume: Fine... Fine. Keep going. Natsume: I don't hate how much it tingles. It's a little scary, but I want you to keep going. Keep kissing me down there... Kousei: It's your own fault for being so wet down here. *lick* *lick* *kiss*... Natsume: Maybe, but you're definitely making those sounds on purpose... Ahhhh! Ah, ah, ah... ahh! Kousei: Wow... You just keep getting wetter and wetter... *lick* *smack*... Natsume: Ahhhh! I-I can't help it... You're kissing it in such a lewd way... Mhhhh! Kousei: I can be even lewder, you know. Natsume: Ah, ahh! Nooo... That's so dirty--ahh! Ahhh! Kousei: *suck* *slurp*... *lick* *lick*... *kiss*... Kousei: *kiss* *pant*... *pant*... *lick* *lick*... *kiss* *suck* Natsume: It feels, too good... I-I can't... *pant*... Hnghh! Natsume: What? *pant*... *pant*... S-Sorry... But if you keep kissing me like that, I... Hngghhh! Natsume: I can't, I can't, I can't... It feels too good! Ahhh, ahhh, eek! Kousei: Well, as long as I'm making you feel good, I'm happy... *suck* *lick*... Natsume: K-Keep... Keep licking my p-pu... that spot... Kiss it more. Kousei: *kiss*... *slurp* *suck*... Natsume: Ahhhhhh! Ah, ah, ahhh! Yes! That feels amazing... Ahhhhh! Kousei: Your reactions make me really happy, Natsume... *kiss* *lick* *lick*... *suck*... Natsume: Ah, ah! Nooo... No more... Ngh! I can't take this... Ahh! Natsume: S-Something's coming! Please, stop! Any more and I'll... Ah, ah, ahh! Kousei: Nhh... *suck* *slurp* *lick*... Natsume: Ahhh! I can't... I can't, I can't... ahh... I'm really gonna--! Natsume: Ah, ah, ahhhhhhhhhhhn! Kousei: You came, didn't you? Natsume: *pant*... *pant*... This is my first time... but I feel so happy... *pant* *pant* *pant* *pant*... Natsume: Wow... My head's gone all mushy... *pant* *pant*... Kousei: Should we take a little break? Natsume: Ngh... No... If we wait, I'll start getting scared again... Natsume: So let's keep going... Let's... have s-sex. Kousei: I haven't even put it in, though... Kousei: Wait--huh?! Don't tell me I just lost my virginity without even knowing it?! Natsume: Oh, hush, you idiot. That's not the only part of sex that feels good. Natsume: Just feeling each other's warmth like this... feels incredible... Kousei: Y-Yeah. Right, of course! Natsume: You're not listening to a word I'm saying, are you? Kousei: What do you want me to do? I'm just too excited about finally losing my virginity. Natsume: I mean, I get that, but still. Kousei: And I get to do it with the girl I love too. I couldn't be happier. Kousei: It's the only thing on my mind right now. Kousei: But you're sure about this, right? You want to go all the way with me? Natsume: Yeah. I want to go all the way. So hold me. Hold me tighter. Kousei: Sure thing. Natsume: It's a lot b-bigger than I thought... Kousei: I think I'm pretty average-sized, actually. Natsume: What?! R-Really? Kousei: Anyway... are you ready, Natsume? It's getting harder and harder to hold myself back. Natsume: I'm ready, but I want you to k-kiss me first. Kousei: I-In THIS position?! Natsume: No, you idiot. I don't mean down there... I mean a normal kiss. Nhh... Natsume: Ahh! *pant* *pant*... *pant*... M-My belly... feels so hot... Kousei: Ngh... Holy shit... Natsume: *pant* *pant*... I-It doesn't feel weird for you... does it? Kousei: Not at all. It feels amazing. Kousei: Your pussy is so warm, and the way it's sucking on me... it's squeezing me so tight. Kousei: And yet it's pulling me deeper still... I've never felt anything like this before. Seriously, it's amazing... Natsume: Me too... I've never... felt something so hot, so d-deep inside me before... Hngh... Kousei: Does it hurt? Natsume: A little bit, sure, but don't worry about me. And I doubt you're capable of stopping right now, right? Kousei: Yeah. Natsume: So I want you to kiss me instead. Make me forget about the pain. Keep me distracted. Kousei: Nhh... *kiss* Natsume: Urk... Nhh *kiss* *kiss*... *smooch*... *smack* *slurp*... Natsume: *pant* *pant*... *pant*... It doesn't hurt, so much as it feels strange... Natsume: Having this thing moving around inside of me is... *pant* *pant*... kind of amazing. Is it all the way inside? Kousei: Yeah. I think I'm all the way in. Kousei: I'm gonna start moving. Kousei: Nhh... *kiss* *smack*... Natsume: I love you... Ahhh... *kiss* *slurp*... I love you... *smooch* *swirl*... *kiss* *kiss*... Kousei: Am I moving too much for you? Natsume: N-No, I'm fine... *kiss*... Ahh, *pant* *pant*... It does hurt a little bit, but I can take it. Natsume: Ah, ah, ah... It hurts, but keep going... *pant* *pant*... What is this? Kousei: It makes me happy to know I'm making you feel good, Natsume. Natsume: It feels like I'm being split apart... like my insides are tingling... *pant*... It feels like it hurts, but it feels so good... Natsume: I-I'm... I'm not the only one feeling good, am I? Does it feel good for you? Kousei: Do you really need to ask? Your pussy feels incredible. It's making me go crazy. Natsume: Ahh?! Ah, hngh! N-Not so rough! Ah, ah, ah, ahh! Natsume: It's making... such a dirty sound! Nghhhh! Kousei: I think it's really hot, actually...

But I can't hold it back--ah! Ah, ah, ah, ah! Kousei: It makes me happier than anything to know that you're feeling good. In fact, it's turning me on even more. Natsume: Urk! At this rate, I'm gonna--mngh! *kiss* *smooch* *smooch* *smack*... *kiss* *kiss* Kousei: *kiss* Nh, mhh, nhh... Natsume: Ahh, I can't, I'm gonna... Ah, ah, ah! Hug me more! Tighter!

Kousei: Natsume... *kiss* Natsume: Mhhh, *smooch* *smack*... It's no use... Even if you kiss me, I... *smooch* *kiss* *kiss* *slurp*... Kousei: Hang in there. I'm about to cum too. Natsume: Ahhh! Ahh! Ahh! I'm gonna cum again! Kousei: Me too. This time, I'm gonna show you how I cum. Natsume: Show me... show me! I want to see you cum! Natsume: *pant* *pant*... Me too... I'm cumming again! Kiss me... kiss me! Kousei: *smooch* *kiss* *kiss* *smack*... *kiss* *smack*... Natsume: Nhhh! Ahh... *pant* *pant*... Ahmph, *kiss* *smooch* *slurp*! Kousei: Nhh, ahh... I'm cumming... Take it all!

            "Kanna: Oh dear! Were you hoping to see me in a maid uniform as well, Takamine-san? Kousei: That's not why I asked. Kanna: So you don't want to see me wear one? Kousei: I mean... I wouldn't say no. Kanna: Nihihi. That's what I thought. Kanna: But unfortunately, the plan is for me to work in the kitchen. I won't be appearing on the dining floor. Kousei: That's a shame. I bet it'd suit you really well. Kanna: Compliments won't get you anything. Except maybe a cup of coffee. Kanna: Here you are. Kousei: Thanks. Kousei: It's not bad. Hell, it's actually quite good. Kanna: Really? You don't have to be polite, you know. I want your honest opinion. Kousei: I am being honest. But... while it's definitely good, there's just nothing special... nothing unique about it. Kanna: I see... Kousei: Sorry. Maybe that's a poor choice of words. Kousei: I wouldn't have any complaints if I ordered this coffee. It's perfectly acceptable. Kanna: But what you're saying is, it's just a regular cup of coffee, right? Kousei: In a manner of speaking. Kanna: I guess I'll need to do some more research if I want to brew a better cup... Kousei: ...... Kousei: So is that the only reason you haven't been able to open for business yet? You can't tell if your coffee's any good? Natsume: We-- Woman: Hello, Natsume-chan. Woman: Would you please prepare a cup of blended coffee for me? Natsume: Certainly. I'll have it ready in a moment. Kousei: ...... Woman: Thank you. Now, let me have a taste. Natsume: What... do you think? Woman: ...... Woman: Natsume-chan... Perhaps this isn't going to work after all. Natsume: ...... Natsume: But... we still have some time before end of the month, don't we? Woman: Yes, but... Natsume: Please, give me a little longer. I promise I'll deliver next time. If you truly think there's no hope by then... I'll give up... Woman: ...... Woman: Alright. A promise is a promise. Try not to push yourself too hard, dear. Natsume: I won't. Thank you. Woman: I'll stop by again soon. Natsume: Of course. We'll be waiting. Kanna: I know. Kousei: Sorry, I'm not sure I do. Natsume: That woman here just now was our landlady. We need her approval in order to open the cafe. Natsume: She agreed to give us approval if we managed to satisfy her as a customer, but... Kousei: It's not going too well, huh? Natsume: She's already visited us several times, but... we just can't seem to meet her standards. Natsume: That's why we needed the help of someone who knows what good coffee tastes like. So we can improve our blend. Kousei: You mentioned something about the end of the month too... Natsume: We've only been allowed to rent this place temporarily, you see. Although our initial agreement was set to expire in the summer, we managed convince her to give us until October, but... Kousei: Still no luck. Natsume: Unfortunately not. Natsume: I think I need to take a break for a bit. Is that alright? Kanna: Ah--yes, of course. Natsume: Thanks. I'll leave the rest to you. Kousei: ...... Kanna: You could say that. Right now, she's on the verge of giving up on something very important herself. At this rate-- Kousei: Her soul will end up lingering the world of the living? Kanna: It's possible, yes. But if we can manage to open this cafe, we might just be able to prevent that. Kousei: She didn't seem particularly supportive, though. Kanna: I wouldn't say she's been unkind to us either. Kousei: Well at any rate, the point is that she isn't satisfied as a customer, right? Kousei: Does she only have a problem with the coffee? What about the other menu items? Kanna: We did have her try our omelet rice one time. Mikado: And our black tea, as well. Kousei: Omelet rice and black tea, huh... Kousei: I'd like to see how those taste too, if that's okay. Would you mind? Mikado: Kanna can prepare the omelet rice for you, but Natsume was the one who made the tea. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Incidentally, what exactly is your job going to be? Mikado: I will be charge of making drinks. I'm already proficient in brewing both coffee and tea. Kousei: I-I see... Kanna: Of course. Leave it to me. Kanna: Please watch over things while I whip up a prototype, Mikado-san. Mikado: Understood. Kanna: Come, Takamine-san. Let's head over to the kitchen, shall we? Kanna: Now then, let's get started. Kanna: We'll need a couple eggs, an onion, some chicken... Kanna: I told you I had a lot of practice. Did you not believe me? Kousei: That's not it, but... Kousei: Do Grim Reapers even need to eat food like regular people to survive? Kanna: It is possible for us to survive without eating, since we're sustained by the power of God. Kanna: But survival isn't everything. If we didn't eat, our souls would weaken... and our physical health would suffer as well. Kousei: Huh. I see. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Was I scowling or something? Sorry. I didn't mean to. Kanna: No, no. I didn't mean it like that. Kanna: It just feels like all my cooking skills are being put to the test... That's why it's a little scary. Kousei: No pressure. This is all just practice too. Kanna: I suppose you're right... Kanna: Here you are! The results of hours upon hours of omelet rice practice! Kousei: Wow, it came out beautifully. This is some restaurant-level quality. Kousei: Actually, I prefer my ketchup spread evenly over the egg... Kanna: Ahh?! What about all my hard work?! Kousei: It's great. Kanna: You really mean it? Kousei: There wouldn't be any point in complimenting you for the sake of it. My life depends on how many customers we can attract, after all. Kousei: It tastes great. It's hard to put into words, but... it has a really gentle flavor. Like a lot of care was put into making it. Kanna: You think so? Well I'm glad you like it. Kousei: I'd have no problems paying for something like this. Omelet rice might be a personal favorite of mine, but I'd definitely order this again sometime. Kousei: It wouldn't even be surprised if it becomes our signature dish. Kanna: ...... Kanna: I'm... very happy to hear you say that. Very, very happy. Kousei: ...... Kousei: There's no need to look that flattered. Kanna: *giggle* Don't say that. A real man has to take responsibility for the compliments he gives. Kousei: Still, I'm only giving you my amateur opinion. I can't guarantee this'll actually sell well. Kanna: But you weren't lying just to spare my feelings, were you? Kousei: No. I really would love to eat this again sometime. Kanna: That's good to hear. Kousei: You must have had to practice a lot to make something this delicious, huh? Kanna: Yes, you could say that... It definitely wasn't easy. Kanna: But that's why it makes me so happy to hear how much you enjoyed it. Kanna: Really... really happy... "

            "Kousei: ...... Kousei: Or rather--please hire me. Kanna: Thank you so much! I'm looking forward to working with you too! Natsume: I suppose that makes us coworkers now. Mikado: Thank you. I'm certain you'll be of great help. Kanna: Thank goodness... I wasn't sure you'd agree at first. Kousei: Well I don't have much of a choice. My life is on the line here. Kanna: Are you having dirty thoughts again? Kousei: Whaaat? That's ridiculous. Prove it. Kanna: That reaction is all the proof I need. Kanna: Not to mention that sleazy look on your face. You were having naughty thoughts, weren't you? Kousei: Wrong. I was... I was just remembering something that happened! Kousei: I was recollecting, not fantasizing. There's a difference. Kanna: Guys who nitpick like that are never going to be popular with women, you know? Kousei: What? Really? Natsume: It is a little annoying. Kousei: Well I wouldn't want that... I'll try to keep it in mind. Natsume: And not to repeat myself, but I really need you to forget what happened yesterday... Kousei: Sorry, but that's impossible. It was way too erotic. Natsume: Are you seriously saying that right to my face? Are you dense? Kanna: Well... it's understandable. Seeing a girl in her underwear would've been too stimulating for a virgin like Takamine-san. Kousei: I appreciate the backup, but you could've left out that last part. Kousei: But anyway--let's get back on topic, shall we? Natsume: Hmph. Kousei: I'm sorry. Please, let me to get back on topic. Kousei: I remember everything you told me about miracles and butterflies, but... what exactly does that have to do with opening this cafe? Mikado: There are several reasons, but in short... Mikado: Butterflies are drawn towards human emotions. In other words, the more popular the cafe and the more customers we have, the more butterflies we will attract as well. Kousei: So instead of going out to hunt for butterflies, this is just a more efficient way of catching them? Mikado: That is certainly part of it, but we are not the only ones who benefit. Mikado: When butterflies gather in a place filled with positive emotion, it may provide them, the soul remnants, with newfound strength. Kousei: So... you're saying... Kousei: Aside from never tampering with reality again, I have to replenish all the soul energy I used up? Mikado: That is one way of looking at it, yes. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Alright, fine. If that means I get to keep my life, I'll do my best. Mikado: Good. Mikado: In that case, you will need to enter into a contract with us. Kousei: A contract... with a Grim Reaper? *gulp* Kousei: If I violate the terms... are you going to take my soul? Kanna: No, it's just a regular employment contract. Here, take a look. Mikado: I hope you brought your personal seal with you today. Kanna: We don't want the Labor Standards Bureau cracking down on us for not contracting our employees. Kousei: ...... Kousei: You're worried about labor laws? Even though you're a literal god of death? Mikado: It is precisely for that reason that we must avoid drawing unnecessary attention. Mikado: Naturally, that means we've obtained all the necessary permits for operation through legal procedures. Kousei: You guys seem to take this more seriously than I thought. Kanna: Thank you very much. Kousei: By the way, I assume you have enough working capital to run the place? And pay my wages? Kousei: I'm actually having a bit of money trouble myself right now, so it's kind of important... Kousei: If you guys are having trouble staying afloat, we'll need to think of a solution, quick. Mikado: There is no need to worry about our funds. Keeping this cafe running is an important enterprise for us as well. Mikado: Our supply of capital comes from other sources. Naturally, however, it is not inexhaustible. But rest assured, we will compensate you appropriately for your work. Kousei: Glad to hear it. Mikado: Nevertheless, that is not to say we can afford to have no customers and earn no profit. Mikado: Our goal here is to run a stable business. Kousei: Of course. Kousei: It... looks like you're already halfway there, though. The place is neat and tidy, and you've got all the tables and chairs set up. Natsume: This used to be a different cafe in the past, you see. They even have a professional kitchen in the back. Kousei: So the place came fully furnished? Natsume: Mh... pretty much, I suppose. Natsume: This uniform was recycled out of the old design, too. Kousei: But if you've already got everything ready to go... why do you need my help? Aside from my \"personal circumstances.\" Natsume: Well, that's because... Do you drink coffee, Takamine-kun? Kousei: I do. Not all the time, though. Kanna: Good! In that case, how about giving our coffee a little taste-test? Natsume: The truth is, we don't have anyone here with a good taste for coffee. Kousei: What? Kanna: Please don't get the wrong idea, though. She's not saying we don't pay attention to our brew. We studied how to do it the proper way. Kanna: But the problem is... since I don't usually drink coffee at all, the only flavor I'm able to make out is bitter. Kanna: I can't tell whether it's the good kind of bitter, or the bad kind... Kousei: What about you, Shiki-san? Natsume: I'm... not a huge fan of coffee either. I can drink it if I try, but... Kousei: Ah, that's right. You can't drink it without heaps of milk and sugar. Natsume: ...... Natsume: And how exactly do you know that? Kousei: I happened to see you buying coffee at the convenience store on campus the other day. Kousei: You tried it black, but then added a ton of milk and sugar afterward. I'm guessing you wanted to see what their coffee tasted like? Natsume: That's right. But I didn't end up learning anything helpful at all... Natsume: In the first place, all coffee is bitter. And things that are bitter are generally poisonous. Isn't it weird that people enjoy drinking poison? Kousei: That kind of logic's a little childish, don't you think? Natsume: ...... Kousei: Surely a nobleman like you would have a discerning palate for coffee? Mikado: The only things I drink are water and milk. You do realize I am a cat, don't you? Kousei: Oh, so now you're just a regular old cat... Kanna: Let me bring you a cup. "

            "Kanna: Oh dear! Were you hoping to see me in a maid uniform as well, Takamine-san? Kousei: That's not why I asked. Kanna: So you don't want to see me wear one? Kousei: I mean... I wouldn't say no. Kanna: Nihihi. That's what I thought. Kanna: But unfortunately, the plan is for me to work in the kitchen. I won't be appearing on the dining floor. Kousei: That's a shame. I bet it'd suit you really well. Kanna: Compliments won't get you anything. Except maybe a cup of coffee. Kanna: Here you are. Kousei: Thanks. Kousei: It's not bad. Hell, it's actually quite good. Kanna: Really? You don't have to be polite, you know. I want your honest opinion. Kousei: I am being honest. But... while it's definitely good, there's just nothing special... nothing unique about it. Kanna: I see... Kousei: Sorry. Maybe that's a poor choice of words. Kousei: I wouldn't have any complaints if I ordered this coffee. It's perfectly acceptable. Kanna: But what you're saying is, it's just a regular cup of coffee, right? Kousei: In a manner of speaking. Kanna: I guess I'll need to do some more research if I want to brew a better cup... Kousei: ...... Kousei: So is that the only reason you haven't been able to open for business yet? You can't tell if your coffee's any good? Natsume: We-- Woman: Hello, Natsume-chan. Woman: Would you please prepare a cup of blended coffee for me? Natsume: Certainly. I'll have it ready in a moment. Kousei: ...... Woman: Thank you. Now, let me have a taste. Natsume: What... do you think? Woman: ...... Woman: Natsume-chan... Perhaps this isn't going to work after all. Natsume: ...... Natsume: But... we still have some time before end of the month, don't we? Woman: Yes, but... Natsume: Please, give me a little longer. I promise I'll deliver next time. If you truly think there's no hope by then... I'll give up... Woman: ...... Woman: Alright. A promise is a promise. Try not to push yourself too hard, dear. Natsume: I won't. Thank you. Woman: I'll stop by again soon. Natsume: Of course. We'll be waiting. Kanna: I know. Kousei: Sorry, I'm not sure I do. Natsume: That woman here just now was our landlady. We need her approval in order to open the cafe. Natsume: She agreed to give us approval if we managed to satisfy her as a customer, but... Kousei: It's not going too well, huh? Natsume: She's already visited us several times, but... we just can't seem to meet her standards. Natsume: That's why we needed the help of someone who knows what good coffee tastes like. So we can improve our blend. Kousei: You mentioned something about the end of the month too... Natsume: We've only been allowed to rent this place temporarily, you see. Although our initial agreement was set to expire in the summer, we managed convince her to give us until October, but... Kousei: Still no luck. Natsume: Unfortunately not. Natsume: I think I need to take a break for a bit. Is that alright? Kanna: Ah--yes, of course. Natsume: Thanks. I'll leave the rest to you. Kousei: ...... Kanna: You could say that. Right now, she's on the verge of giving up on something very important herself. At this rate-- Kousei: Her soul will end up lingering the world of the living? Kanna: It's possible, yes. But if we can manage to open this cafe, we might just be able to prevent that. Kousei: She didn't seem particularly supportive, though. Kanna: I wouldn't say she's been unkind to us either. Kousei: Well at any rate, the point is that she isn't satisfied as a customer, right? Kousei: Does she only have a problem with the coffee? What about the other menu items? Kanna: We did have her try our omelet rice one time. Mikado: And our black tea, as well. Kousei: Omelet rice and black tea, huh... Kousei: I'd like to see how those taste too, if that's okay. Would you mind? Mikado: Kanna can prepare the omelet rice for you, but Natsume was the one who made the tea. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Incidentally, what exactly is your job going to be? Mikado: I will be charge of making drinks. I'm already proficient in brewing both coffee and tea. Kousei: I-I see... Kanna: Of course. Leave it to me. Kanna: Please watch over things while I whip up a prototype, Mikado-san. Mikado: Understood. Kanna: Come, Takamine-san. Let's head over to the kitchen, shall we? Kanna: Now then, let's get started. Kanna: We'll need a couple eggs, an onion, some chicken... Kanna: I told you I had a lot of practice. Did you not believe me? Kousei: That's not it, but... Kousei: Do Grim Reapers even need to eat food like regular people to survive? Kanna: It is possible for us to survive without eating, since we're sustained by the power of God. Kanna: But survival isn't everything. If we didn't eat, our souls would weaken... and our physical health would suffer as well. Kousei: Huh. I see. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Was I scowling or something? Sorry. I didn't mean to. Kanna: No, no. I didn't mean it like that. Kanna: It just feels like all my cooking skills are being put to the test... That's why it's a little scary. Kousei: No pressure. This is all just practice too. Kanna: I suppose you're right... Kanna: Here you are! The results of hours upon hours of omelet rice practice! Kousei: Wow, it came out beautifully. This is some restaurant-level quality. Kousei: Actually, I prefer my ketchup spread evenly over the egg... Kanna: Ahh?! What about all my hard work?! Kousei: It's great. Kanna: You really mean it? Kousei: There wouldn't be any point in complimenting you for the sake of it. My life depends on how many customers we can attract, after all. Kousei: It tastes great. It's hard to put into words, but... it has a really gentle flavor. Like a lot of care was put into making it. Kanna: You think so? Well I'm glad you like it. Kousei: I'd have no problems paying for something like this. Omelet rice might be a personal favorite of mine, but I'd definitely order this again sometime. Kousei: It wouldn't even be surprised if it becomes our signature dish. Kanna: ...... Kanna: I'm... very happy to hear you say that. Very, very happy. Kousei: ...... Kousei: There's no need to look that flattered. Kanna: *giggle* Don't say that. A real man has to take responsibility for the compliments he gives. Kousei: Still, I'm only giving you my amateur opinion. I can't guarantee this'll actually sell well. Kanna: But you weren't lying just to spare my feelings, were you? Kousei: No. I really would love to eat this again sometime. Kanna: That's good to hear. Kousei: You must have had to practice a lot to make something this delicious, huh? Kanna: Yes, you could say that... It definitely wasn't easy. Kanna: But that's why it makes me so happy to hear how much you enjoyed it. Kanna: Really... really happy... "

            "Kousei: It's a bit late, but I'm thinking of trying bookkeeping. Kousei: I'm also planning to take a few courses in business management too, though. Hiroto: Uh, wouldn't it be an easier idea to just renroll into the College of Business? Kousei: I thought about that, but I decided to just study the basics, then pick up the rest as I go along. Kousei: I think I'll learn a lot more that way, rather than just sitting in school. Hiroto: Hmm... Where are you gonna work then? Kousei: Probably... not at some big company. Kousei: I'm trying to learn a bit more about accounting and that sort of stuff at the cafe. And after that... Kousei: I'm thinking of asking my dad to teach me a few things too. Hiroto: Didn't you say your dad was a painter or something? Kousei: Yeah, but he also does some other consulting work on the side. Hiroto: Huh... Okay. Kousei: What about you? What are you planning on doing? Hiroto: Still trying to figure that out. Hiroto: I'm jealous as hell, though. You don't have to job hunt like the rest of us. Kousei: I mean, I'm basically just postponing it till later. Kousei: I pretty much still haven't decided anything about my future yet. Hiroto: Guess that's true... Hiroto: Welp, good luck in your future endeavors. Hope you earn lots of money, brother-in-law. Kousei: I'll try to, Hiroto-kun. Hiroto: ...... Kousei: ...... Hiroto & Kousei: Blllaaarrrggghhh! Hiroto: Calling you that makes me wanna puke... Kousei: Yeah, same for me. Seriously, please don't call me that ever again. Hiroto: But you ARE going out with my sister, aren't you? Kousei: Yeah. Hiroto: Well, I'm glad. By all means, take that worthless baggage off my hands. Kousei: Hey. Don't go calling my girlfriend worthless. I'll beat your ass. Hiroto: My bad. Kousei: If I wasn't serious about your sister, I wouldn't be going out with her. Hiroto: Yeah, I know. Despite all her flaws, I guess she is pretty devoted, for what it's worth. Hiroto: When she decided to become a pastry chef, she threw herself body and soul into that too. Kousei: It's that passion that got her to where she is today. Hiroto: Yeah, I guess so. Hiroto: Just try not to get yourself stabbed, alright? Kousei: I doubt that's gonna happen. Hiroto: Well, if you say so. Hiroto: But I gotta ask... What the hell do you find attractive about her? Kousei: What do you mean? Hiroto: Is it the whole \"jailbait\" thing she has going on? Kousei: No, not really. In fact, I'm actually more of a fan of big tits. Hiroto: Yet you're going out with a girl that's got none? Kousei: Yeah, well... I'm more attracted to who she is on the inside. Hiroto: I don't get it... To me, she's a total menace. Kousei: Don't say that. She can be cute too, you know. Hiroto: Her? Cute? Honestly... I just don't get your tastes, man. Suzune: Gnhrgghhh... Natsume: Order coming in. I need two plates of pancakes, one with strawberry syrup and one with chocolate syrup. Suzune: A-Alright... Natsume: Hmm? Natsume: Is something the matter? Suzune: Sorry, my chest just hurts a little... Natsume: What? That sounds serious! You should go to the hospital! Suzune: Uhh, it's not the kind of chest pain you're thinking of. Natsume: But you're still in pain, aren't you? Suzune: Yes, I am.. Suzune: These wires... are really digging into my skin... Grngh... Natsume: Come again? Natsume: Ahh... Your skin's already turning red. Suzune: How the hell does wearing a bra hurt this much... Natsume: That's just how underwire bras are, I'm afraid. Suzune: I've heard the stories, but I didn't think it'd be THIS bad. Natsume: You normally wear more comfortable ones, don't you? Suzune: Yeah. I don't really need that much support, given my cup size. Natsume: You shouldn't force yourself to wear them. If they chafe too much, you might even start bleeding. Suzune: Ngh... Natsume: Why are you grimacing? Suzune: Because of that little shit, Kousei... Do you know what he said to me the first time he saw me undress? Kousei: It's hard to see you as an adult, wearing that kind of underwear... Suzune: Can you believe that? Natsume: Yes... I actually can... Suzune: Well, anyway, I figured it couldn't hurt to wear something a little more my age. Suzune: Also, I think he's a tits kind of guy, so I thought I'd throw him a bone and try on a push-up bra. Natsume: Ah, so that's why you're wearing a wire bra. Suzune: Still... pushing them together hasn't done anything except make them look like two identical acorns. Suzune: Hey, shuddup! My nipples ain't acorns, dammit! Natsume: I didn't say that. Natsume: Nobody said a single thing about your nipples. Please stop trying to use raunchy jokes to escape from reality. Suzune: Sorry... Natsume: In any case, there are plenty of nice-looking bras out there that don't have wires in them. Suzune: Would you be willing to come help me pick? Natsume: What, you mean underwear shopping? Suzune: Yeah. I've only ever worn the most comfortable bras I could find... so I don't how to find anything else. Natsume: Ah... Well, sure. I guess I don't mind. Suzune: Really?! Thank you so much! Suzune: I'll show you who's an adult woman, Kousei. Hehehe... Just you wait. Suzune: Kousei. Kousei: Yeah? What's up? Suzune: Mind if I take a break? A bit of a long one, actually. Suzune: In fact... I might not be back until closing. Kousei: Alright. That's fine. Kousei: I imagine you have some sort of reason for doing so. Suzune: Yeah. Thanks. Suzune: Don't worry, you won't regret it. Anyway, take care of things here for me. Kousei: Can do. Kousei: \"I won't regret it\"? Natsume: Suzune-san sure is cute, isn't she? It's kind of surprising how devoted she is. Kousei: What are you talking about? Natsume: Nothing. Natsume: Anyway, I'm going to be taking a rather long break as well. Don't wait up. Kousei: Oh, okay. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Both of them are taking an extended break at the same time? Kousei: Well, whatever. Kousei: Oh, well. It's just for one day, so I don't really mind. Kousei: Still... where on earth did Suzune-san go off to? Kousei: Or maybe I should just mind my own business. Kousei: Hrmh... Honestly, the subtleties of the female mind are far beyond me. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Well, at least I'm done cleaning now. Kousei: Hm? Suzune: Oh? You're finished already? Kousei: Yeah. Suzune: Damn... Sorry. I tried to hurry back as soon I could. Kousei: It's fine. Kousei: ...... Suzune: Phew... That feels so much better. Wish I would've gone with this first. Kousei: What are you talking about? Suzune: Nothin'. Don't worry about it. Kousei: Er... by the way. You don't have to answer if you don't want to, but I'm curious. Kousei: Where exactly did you go? Suzune: Where? Do you really wanna know? Kousei: Well, yeah. Suzune: Heh... *giggle*... You little horndog. Kousei: What does that have to do with anything? Suzune: Good question... *giggle* Kousei: Did you not want me asking about it? Suzune: No, that's fine. But, hmm... Suzune: Let's see. I suppose you DO deserve a reward for holding down the fort on your own... *giggle* Suzune: Is that all you want? Kousei: Well, if you're offering me something... even more appetizing, I certainly wouldn't say no. Suzune: I knew you'd say that. You're such a little perv, you know that? Kousei: Excuse me. All I said was \"something more appetizing.\" You're the perv for immediately assuming I meant something sexual. Suzune: Oh-ho? So my assumption was wrong? Kousei: Well, no. It wasn't. Suzune: That's what I thought. *giggle* Kousei: So... are you gonna tell me what you were doing that was so important you needed to skip work for? Suzune: Hmph... Feast your eyes. Kousei: *gulp*... Suzune: *giggle*... I like that reaction. Suzune: This is a little... no, very embarrassing... but seeing you make that face makes it all worth it. Kousei: Well, your underwear is just... that cute and sexy. Suzune: Does it turn you on? Kousei: You have no idea. Hell, there's no way I wouldn't be turned on. Suzune: Looks like it... *giggle* You're hard as a rock. Kousei: I had no idea you were into this... Suzune: Actually, what I'm \"into\" is making my boyfriend happy. Kousei: Well, I'm really happy. That erotic lingerie looks amazing on you. Suzune: Oh, come on. It's not THAT erotic. Kousei: I mean, compared to the pairs you usual wear... it definitely is. Suzune: Is it, though? I don't have any boobs. Kousei: It still turns me on. Suzune: *giggle*... You perv... Kousei: I don't wanna hear that coming from someone wearing sexy underwear. Suzune: Yeah, I guess... Even I'm surprised at how dirty a girl I've become... Suzune: It's all your fault. Suzune: All your reactions are just too cute... way too cute. Kousei: Well, you say you like them. Suzune: Yeah, but, like... Actually, wait. Aren't you staring a little TOO much? Kousei: It's not my fault... I can't stop myself. Kousei: You went through the trouble of buying a pair of sexy lingerie for my sake, after all. Suzune: I told you, stop calling it that. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Just out of curiosity... What do your panties look like? Suzune: They came in a set, obviously... Do you want to see them? Kousei: Absolutely. Suzune: Geez, you really are a perv. Suzune: *giggle* I like that reaction. It's nice and honest. Kousei: What, and yours isn't? Kousei: I've been staring at you this whole time. Suzune: Well... yeah... It's been flipped a little bit, I guess. Kousei: Only a little? Suzune: Yes... Kousei: You did buy these specifically to show me... Suzune: Well, if you're that crazy about me... I guess I kinda have to. Kousei: Well, I won't deny that I'm crazy for you... Kousei: I knew you were turned on. You're ridiculously turned on. Suzune: Ugh... I can't believe I'm getting these wet on the very day I bought them. Kousei: Don't worry. Mine are just as wet. Suzune: That doesn't make me feel any better... Wait. They are? Kousei: Yep. They're sticky with cum. Suzune: Then why don't you take them off? Kousei: Huh? Suzune: I mean, you don't want them getting any more dirty, so why not just take your dick out? Suzune: Plus it's embarrassing for me to be the only one doing this... Hurry up and show me your body too. Kousei: This all is your fault, just so you know. Suzune: It's so hard... and stiff... *pant* *pant*... It's hard not to remember... Suzune: But if I take them off, how are you gonna get a good look at them? I bought them for you, remember? Kousei: Well, do you want them to get dirty? Suzune: N-No. I just bought them... It'd be a shame if they got any dirtier than they already are. Kousei: You're totally soaked. Suzune: This is... the first time I've ever gotten this wet without touching it... Kousei: Don't you normally get this wet when you touch it? Suzune: I mean... You'd know more about that than me. Kousei: I guess so. Kousei: I was just wondering if you've ever masturbated... Suzune: Why do you want to know? Kousei: Well... I kinda want to see how you do it. Suzune: How I do it? *pant* *pant*... I just do it normally, I guess... Kousei: That's my point. I don't know what \"normally\" means. Kousei: I'm a guy. Suzune: I mean, I don't know what to tell you... It's not like I masturbate THAT often... Suzune: *pant*... *pant*... *inhale*... *pant*... Kousei: ...... Suzune: *pant*... Gosh, could you not stare so much? Kousei: I'm just curious. So this is how you do it... Right there's your clit, right? Suzune: *pant* *pant*... Y-Yeah. This is the spot I usually like to touch... Nhh?! Mhh, mhh! Kousei: You really like playing with your clit, huh? Kousei: You seem like you'd enjoy fingering yourself too, though. Suzune: Mhh! Ah, ah! Nh... It doesn't feel as good... when I do it myself... *pant* *pant*... Suzune: I think I like it better when you do it instead... Nh, nhhh! Kousei: That makes me... ridiculously happy to hear. Suzune: Gosh... It's your fault I've become such a dirty girl. Kousei: That's supposed to be a compliment, right? Suzune: Yeah... Nhhh! My fingers won't stop... *pant* *pant* *pant*... *pant*... Kousei: C'mon. Let me get a better look. Suzune: Nooo... *pant* *pant*... *pant* *pant*... Kousei: You're not about to cum already, are you? Kousei: Judging my how much you're twitching, though... it looks like you are. Suzune: I don't know! I don't know, but... Suzune: Ah, ah, ahhh! This feels so good... It really turns me on, being watched while I do this... Ahhhh! Kousei: *pant*... *pant*... *pant*... Suzune: W-Wow... Your dick is so stiff it's almost touching your stomach... and it's leaking so much too... Kousei: I feel like I'm about to explode just from watching you masturbate... Suzune: You sure have a spunky dick, don't you? Kousei: Don't act like you don't love it. Suzune: Yeah, I do... I love your hard dick... Just remembering how good it felt last time is enough to make me... Ahh! Ahhhh! Kousei: That's fine. Do it. Show me how you cum. Suzune: *pant*... *pant*... So do you... Kousei: I can't hold back anymore. You'll take responsibility for making me so horny... won't you? Kousei: I'd expect a proper adult woman to. Suzune: You're right. I am an adult woman... *giggle* Suzune: Ahh! H-Hold on... You want to do it like this? Kousei: You don't? Suzune: Well, the problem is... my feet can't even touch the ground. Kousei: Don't worry. I'll support you. Kousei: I'll support you no matter what, Suzune-san. Suzune: I thought you said you wanted ME to take responsibility... I can't do anything like this. Kousei: Come on... Please? Suzune: There you go, giving me those puppy-dog eyes again... You just wanted to give this a try, didn't you? Suzune: Fine. Have it your way. Kousei: That's why I love you. Suzune: Yeah, yeah... But if I tell you it hurts, then you'd better pump the brakes, mister. Kousei: Hmm... I'll try my best. No guarantees, though. Kousei: It feels way too good inside you. My brakes might end up malfunctioning. Suzune: Why am I not surprised? In fact, it feels like you're on the verge of losing control already... Suzune: Well... that's because I already came once... Kousei: I take it you're more than ready then? Suzune: You don't need to ask. Kousei: You're right. Sorry. Kousei: This where I'm supposed to take the initiative, right? Suzune: A-Ah, ahhh! Nghhh?! Kousei: Doesn't seem like it hurt, though. Kousei: Your body's gotten so greedy. Suzune: Who's fault do you think that is? Ah, ahh, ah, ahh! Kousei: Huh? Suzune: Urk! Nhhggghhhhhh! Kousei: Ngh... You're tightening up so much... Kousei: Did you just cum again? Suzune: Ahh! *pant* *pant*... *pant*... *pant*... Kousei: All I did was put it in, you know? Suzune: I couldn't help it, okay? I'm still sensitive from cumming earlier... *pant*... *pant*... Suzune: Are you saying I wasn't cute at first? Kousei: I'm saying your cuteness has skyrocketed. You were cute at first, but now you're ridiculously cute. Kousei: I love you... so much... Suzune: Ahhh?! Kousei: It feels amazing for me too. Kousei: You're so hot and sticky... I don't think I can control myself. Suzune: You perv... Kousei: Right back at ya. Suzune: Yeah, you're right... We're both huge perverts. Kousei: Agreed. Kousei: Especially... this dirty pussy of yours. Kousei: See? Look how tightly it's gripping me. Suzune: Y-Yeah... because you're rubbing me with something so thick... Nghh! Ah?! Ah, ah?! Suzune: W-Wait, wait! You're rubbing me too much! Ahhhhhh! Kousei: That's only because you're clamping down so tightly... Nhh... Kousei: You're squeezing all my sensitive spots... Ngh... Suzune: Ahhh, ah! Ah, ah! You're hitting all my weak spots too! Ah, ah, ah! Kousei: You mean... right here? Suzune: Ahhhhhh! Yes, right there! That feels amazing! Nhhhhhhh! Kousei: You like this spot, don't you? Suzune: Ahh! Yes, yes, yes! Ah, ahhh! Oh god! I'm going crazy! Ahhhhhh! Kousei: You look so cute right now... So sexy. Suzune: *pant* *pant*... *pant*... Your dick is so hot and hard... It feels so good! Kousei: S-Suzune-san! Kousei: I'm sorry, but I can't stop... I can't stop myself anymore! Suzune: Your switch is totally flipped! Ahhhh! Nhhh, ack... Ahhhh! Kousei: I'm way past my tipping point... Your pussy feels way too good! Suzune: Ah, ah, ah, ah! Ngh... Nghh?! Kousei: I can keep grinding you like this, right? Suzune: Nhhhh! Y-Yes, keep going! Ah, ahh! Ahh! Kousei: I'll do what I can! Suzune: Nh, ahh, ahhhhhh! *pant* *pant* *pant*! I love that, I love that! Kousei: Suzune-san, Suzune-san! Suzune: *pant* *pant* Ahhh! More! More, more! Ah, ah, ah, ahhhhhhh! Suzune: I can't help iiitttt... Ahhhhhhh! You're gonna make me cum... You're making me cum! Kousei: I'm... about to cum too! Suzune: Ah, ah, ahhh! You're getting so big... swelling up inside me so much! Nh, ahhhh! Kousei: I can keep going, can't I? I can, right? Actually, I'm sorry--I can't stop myself anymore. Suzune: Nh, nhh! It's okay... You can cum... Just please, keep grinding... Ah, ah, ahhh! Suzune: I've never! I've never felt this good befoooore! Kousei: You're making such a dirty face... Suzune: I can't control it! Ah! Ah! Ahhhhhhhh! Suzune: No, wait! Wait! Just a little longer! Ahh! Kousei: Ngh, hngh! Kousei: Suzune-san, Suzune-san! I'm cumming! Suzune: Nhh, nghh! Me too! Ahh! Me too! I'm cumming... I'm cumming, I'm cumming, I'm cumming! Suzune: Ngh, ahhhhhhhhh! Suzune: Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh! Suzune: *pant* *pant*... Getting creampied... feels amazing... Kousei: Ngh... Your pussy's wringing me dry... Kousei: *pant*... *pant*... This seems a little uncomfortable for you, though. Kousei: I'm gonna let you down, okay? Suzune: O-Okay... But if you take it out right now... Nghh?! Kousei: S-Suzune-san, I'm cumming... I'm gonna cum, okay? Kousei: I-I'm cumming! Suzune: Ah, ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Suzune: Gosh, you cum too much... *pant*... *pant*... But it felt amazing. Kousei: It felt amazing for me too... Suzune: I can hardly stand... Kousei: Don't worry. I've got you. Suzune: Thanks... but no round two, okay? I seriously can't. Kousei: ...... Suzune: Oh, come on. Don't pretend like you cant hear me, you little perv. Suzune: Seriously, though. You got way too carried away. Kousei: Only because you were showing off your bra and panties to me. Suzune: So I take it they were to your liking? Kousei: Do you really need to ask? Suzune: I guess not. *giggle* Kousei: They got me super horny. Kousei: Almost TOO horny... After all that, my body feels kinda drained. Suzune: Well, good. If I'm being honest, though, I wanted something that would make my boobs a little bigger. Kousei: Don't worry. It would be all the same, either way. Suzune: Wow. You want an ass-beatin'? Kousei: Sorry, I didn't mean it like that. Kousei: I just meant I'm happy you went out of your way to pick these for me. That's all that matters. Suzune: Really? Kousei: Yeah. Suzune: Well, the truth is... I actually bought a couple other bras as well. Kousei: Lemme see! Suzune: Whoa, whoa. I thought you said you were already drained? Kousei: I'm not saying we have to do it today. Kousei: We'll have plenty of opportunities in the future to put them to good use. Suzune: Yeah, you're right. Suzune: After all, you promised you'd continue supporting me forever, didn't you? Kousei: That I did. Suzune: Perfect! I'm gonna hold you that. "

Kousei: Well, you'll still be done tomorrow, right? Hiroto: Yeah. I'm still jealous, though... Kousei: How do you think you'll do? Hiroto: I should be able to pass. I mean, I have to. If I end up failing, I'm gonna get my ass beat. Kousei: Good luck. Hiroto: Thanks. Hiroto: Anyway, I gotta get to my next class. Catch ya later. Kousei: See ya. Kousei: I'd better get to work soon. Kousei: Good morning. Suzune: Morning. Kousei: Any orders I can do? Suzune: Wanna take care of some pancakes for me? They're the deluxe strawberry version. Kousei: Sure. Natsume: How did your finals go? Kousei: I did pretty well, I think. I doubt I got all A's, but I'm confident I got some solid B's. Natsume: Ah. That's good. Kousei: And now that I've passed my exams--I think it's time for my reward. Natsume: ...... Kousei: Hey now. You'd better not have forgotten about our promise. Natsume: I haven't. But this is hardly the place to discuss it... Idiot. Natsume: Just fine. Kousei: Great. Why don't we go on a date to celebrate? Natsume: ...... Kousei: I don't mean THAT kind of date. Just a regular one. Kousei: There's a place I've been wanting to go visit with you for a while now. Kousei: Wanna go there tomorrow? Kousei: Come to think of it, we haven't even gone on a proper date yet. Natsume: Yeah, we haven't... but are you sure that's the only reason you're asking me out? Kousei: Honestly, no. Kousei: But I'm not lying when I say I want to go on a date with you. As for the \"reward\" you promised me, well, I'll leave that up to you. Kousei: It doesn't have to be tomorrow. I'll try my best to be patient. Natsume: Fine. Kousei: That being said, I don't think I can wait very long either. Natsume: I know that too. Kousei: So we're set for our date tomorrow? Natsume: Well, sure. I want to go on a date too. In fact... I'm really happy you asked. Kousei: Great. Kousei: Nope. Not at all. Natsume: Pfft... I never thought I'd get the chance to say something so cliche. Kousei: Me neither. Natsume: You said you had somewhere in mind. Kousei: You'll see when we get there. Think of it as a surprise. Natsume: Well, alright. Kousei: We're gonna take the train, so let's get going. Natsume: Okay. Kousei: Wh-What's wrong? Natsume: Hm? Nothing. Kousei: Okay? Maid: Please, follow me to your seats. Maid: Once you've decided on your order, please ring me over with this bell. Kousei: Thanks. Kousei: Alright. I think I'll start with a Darjeeling. Kousei: What about you, Natsume? Natsume: Kandy... Kousei: You got it. Kousei: We'd like a Darjeeling tea and a Kandy tea, please. Maid: Certainly. Kousei: You don't seem too happy. Kousei: This place has a pretty good reputation, actually. And the prices are reasonable too. Natsume: I never said the service here was bad. And I'm not saying we should've gone somewhere more expensive either. Natsume: But would you normally come here for a first date? Would you normally bring your girlfriend with you to a maid cafe? Kousei: Well, maybe not normally, no. Kousei: In fact, I doubt I'd have ever come here if it weren't for our date today. Natsume: How exactly were you expecting me to react to this? Kousei: Come on. Let's just try and enjoy ourselves. Kousei: Can you do that for me? Natsume: Well, I guess there's no point in complaining now that we're already inside. Kousei: I've heard a lot of good things about the tea here too. Natsume: Hmm. Alright, fine. I'll try to enjoy myself. *sigh*... Kousei: Hmm. I agree. Kousei: Very aromatic. A little astringent--but not too strong. Kousei: Honestly, this might even be better than the tea we serve at our cafe. It's obviously miles ahead of the bottled stuff. Natsume: It's ultimately a matter of taste, so it's hard to say for certain. Natsume: But I think the people who prefer to come somewhere and savor a cup of tea by itself would probably like this place more. Kousei: True. Most of our customers usually only order tea with cake, or some other sweets. Natsume: It really does smell amazing. I shouldn't have underestimated maid cafes. I thought they all relied on the moe factor. Kousei: I'm glad you like it. Kousei: See? These sort of quiet, relaxing places aren't half bad. Natsume: Well, it's not bad, I'll admit. Kousei: Then what do you say we try something similar? Natsume: What do you mean? Kousei: I'm talking about your maid outfit. You were looking for an excuse to wear it, weren't you? Kousei: So why don't we try doing an authentic maid cafe experience ourselves? None of that \"moe moe kyun!\" stuff, like last time. Natsume: You still remember that? Kousei: Of course I do. Kousei: It's something you've always dreamed of, no? Those uniforms in that picture you drew as a kid. Natsume: ...... Kousei: I love you, Natsume. What I want most is to see you smile. Kousei: And that's why I want to make your dreams come true. Kousei: As your boyfriend, seeing you smile makes me smile. Natsume: I appreciate that and all, but still... Kousei: I'm not suggesting we overhaul the entire cafe, obviously. Kousei: But maybe we can offer a special \"maid service\" during certain times or certain days of the week? Y'know, like a traditional afternoon tea. Kousei: At the very least, it can't hurt to try. Kousei: Suzune-san's cakes are selling great, and our coffee and tea are getting pretty decent sales too. Kousei: I don't think our female customers would mind the quieter atmosphere either. You said it yourself; you don't mind it. Natsume: Maybe not, but I'm not sure we should be promoting Cafe Stella as a maid cafe. Natsume: Regardless of whether or not we are, it might give people the wrong idea about us... Kousei: That's where Mikado comes in. Kousei: We'll get him to play the role of a butler. Kousei: That way, it'll make the whole \"afternoon tea\" thing seem more authentic. Plus, I bet it'll make him even more popular with the neighborhood housewives. Kousei: I think people would like it. He'd make for a very handsome butler. Natsume: Well, I suppose it'd appeal to our current, existing customer base... Kousei: Of course, there's no telling how they'll react until we try it, but I think it's worth a shot. Kousei: Don't you want to see your drawing become a reality? Natsume: How long have you been thinking about this, by the way? Kousei: Since the stall on New Year's. When people started associating your qipao with authentic Chinese flavor. Kousei: That's why I brought you here today. Kousei: It's not because I have a thing for maids or anything. Natsume: Sorry. I totally misunderstood. Kousei: Yeah, you were giving me a real stink-eye. Natsume: Can you blame me? Imagine suddenly finding yourself at a maid cafe on your first date. Kousei: I was just hoping to surprise you a little. Natsume: I don't like surprises. Natsume: If you start hiring flash mobs or something ridiculous like that, I'm breaking up with you on the spot. Kousei: Duly noted. Kousei: Still, though... you do like the place, don't you? Natsume: Well... I guess. I just wish you would've said something beforehand. Kousei: Sorry. Natsume: But knowing how much thought you've put into this for my sake makes me really happy. Kousei: So let's put our all into this, together. Natsume: Yeah. Thanks. Kousei: Actually, I was a little too preoccupied with discussing the maid thing today that I didn't really plan anything else... Sorry! Kousei: How about we go with the standard date? Kousei: See a movie, go window shopping. That sorta thing. Natsume: Sure. That's fine with me. Kousei: (Still... Hmm... Mgh....) Natsume: What? Stop sneaking peeks at me like that. It's creepy. Kousei: Wow. That hurts, you know? Natsume: Well? Are you going to tell me what's on your mind, or not? Kousei: I was just... wondering if it was okay to hold your hand. Y'know, whether or not it was the right time to. Natsume: That's what got you so nervous? Kousei: I know, but I can't do anything about it. Kousei: I'm too scared of you rejecting me. Natsume: If I didn't want to hold your hand, I wouldn't have come on this date. Or I would've left halfway through. That's the type of person I am. Natsume: You don't need to be scared of anything, I promise. Kousei: Well, in that case... Kousei: Err, I hope I'm not wrong about this. That'd be... pretty awkward. Kousei: Sorry I made you wait. Natsume: You better be. My fingers were about to freeze. Kousei: Sorry. I mean it. Natsume: Well, as long as you warm them up, I'll let you off. "

It's seriously delicious. Kousei: The aroma and flavor are really well balanced. Even better than it was before, and that's saying something. Natsume: Well, thanks. Natsume: But please forget about the whole moe moe kyun thing, and don't bring it up again. Kousei: And if I do? Natsume: I'll spank you. Natsume: Have you really forgotten? You and your dad were the ones who suggested I greet customers like this. Kousei: Hey, that was him, not me. Kousei: But, like, I thought you were totally against this cafe being a maid cafe. Natsume: I was at first, but after what you both said, I thought it wouldn't hurt to give it a try. Natsume: But on second thought, I really can't do this. It's almost like there's a second me standing behind my back, staring at me in contempt. Kousei: Yeah, I know that feeling. Natsume: I feel like a complete and utter idiot. Makes me want to crawl into a hole and die... Kousei: Well, it was pretty cute. Natsume: ...... Kousei: Okay, okay. I'm sorry. I wasn't trying to make fun of you, I swear, but I'll drop the subject. Kousei: Still, why are you wearing that outfit specifically? Kousei: Are you not happy with our current uniforms? I know they're a bit of a departure from the old ones... Natsume: I mean, it's tolerable... Natsume: To be honest, I hate how my legs are so exposed in it, but I don't regret changing the uniforms in and of itself. Natsume: It brightens up the atmosphere in the place, and we're drawing in more customers than I ever thought possible. I'm happy we did that, and I'm grateful to you for the idea. Kousei: But there's still some reason you wanted to wear that outfit over it, no? Natsume: Well, I guess... It's just a selfish desire... Kousei: Okay? Natsume: I want to wear something that'll make our customers happy, of course--but this is something I wanted to wear personally. Natsume: Anyway, this was just a little experiment. Forget about it, will you? Kousei: Easier said than done. Natsume: Alright, Master. It's time to add the final ingredient--moe! Please join me. Natsume: Now, together--moe, moe, kyun! Kousei: You know, the more you tell me to, the harder it is to erase from my mind... Natsume: Want me to forcibly erase it for you? Kousei: No, thank you. Please stop threatening to knock me in the head. Natsume: *sigh*... It feels like you've seen me doing the last thing I'd ever want you to see me doing. Kousei: Well, that was all you. Kousei: Just your imagination. Kousei: Anyway, back to what we were talking about--the whole moe moe kyun thing. Natsume: Did you literally not hear a word I said? Kousei: Wait, I'm not teasing you. I'm being serious here. Kousei: That whole maid cafe shtick honestly wasn't half-bad. Natsume: Then why'd you have such a lukewarm reaction when I did it... Kousei: Well, that's 'cause you wanted me to do it WITH you. Kinda took me out of the moment and made me ask myself what the hell we're doing. Kousei: Still, I can't say I didn't like it. I actually thought it was pretty cute.  Kousei: But then again, I am a guy. Natsume: Yeah, I know. Most of our customers are women anyway. So, with that in mind... Natsume: As of today, Cafe Stella's maid service will be shut down, terminated, and discontinued. Thank you for your patronage. Natsume: We will be resuming regular waitress operations from now on, but we hope you'll keep visiting us, Master. Natsume: There you have it. Kousei: Man, that's a shame. Kousei: I think you were onto something. It had a certain... charm to it. Natsume: No need to spare my feelings. Sorry you had to go along with this silly idea of mine. Kousei: That's okay. I asked you to go to the bar with me, so we're even. Natsume: I know; I haven't forgotten. Still, we probably shouldn't drink on an empty stomach. Why don't we have dinner together first? Kousei: Wait, what? D-Dinner? T-Together? Really? Kousei: I mean, I don't mind. At all. Sure. Yes. I would very much like to. Natsume: Urk. Why are you talking like that? It's honestly gross. Kousei: What do you want? I wasn't expecting a dinner invitation. Of course I sound nervous. Natsume: You're never going to be a chad at this rate, dude. Kousei: Stop bringing that up! Natsume: Well, now we're even. Kousei: Is it really that much fun, humiliating me? Natsume: Pretty fun, yeah. Natsume: Anyway, I'm going to get changed first. Kousei: Alright. I'll wait here. Kousei: ...... Kousei: This... isn't a dinner date. We're just a pair of friends eating together. Totally normal. Natsume: It's kind of a habit. I always go home, take a bath to relax, climb into bed to sleep--then it hits me. Natsume: \"Wait, did I remember to lock the door?\" Kousei: Yeah, I can relate. And once the thought gets into your head, it won't stop nagging at you. "

I wouldn't say no. Kanna: Nihihi. That's what I thought. Kanna: But unfortunately, the plan is for me to work in the kitchen. I won't be appearing on the dining floor. Kousei: That's a shame. I bet it'd suit you really well. Kanna: Compliments won't get you anything. Except maybe a cup of coffee. Kanna: Here you are. Kousei: Thanks. Kousei: It's not bad. Hell, it's actually quite good. Kanna: Really? You don't have to be polite, you know. I want your honest opinion. Kousei: I am being honest. But... while it's definitely good, there's just nothing special... nothing unique about it. Kanna: I see... Kousei: Sorry. Maybe that's a poor choice of words. Kousei: I wouldn't have any complaints if I ordered this coffee. It's perfectly acceptable. Kanna: But what you're saying is, it's just a regular cup of coffee, right? Kousei: In a manner of speaking. Kanna: I guess I'll need to do some more research if I want to brew a better cup... Kousei: ...... Kousei: So is that the only reason you haven't been able to open for business yet? You can't tell if your coffee's any good? Natsume: We-- Woman: Hello, Natsume-chan. Woman: Would you please prepare a cup of blended coffee for me? Natsume: Certainly. I'll have it ready in a moment. Kousei: ...... Woman: Thank you. Now, let me have a taste. Natsume: What... do you think? Woman: ...... Woman: Natsume-chan... Perhaps this isn't going to work after all. Natsume: ...... Natsume: But... we still have some time before end of the month, don't we? Woman: Yes, but... Natsume: Please, give me a little longer. I promise I'll deliver next time. If you truly think there's no hope by then... I'll give up... Woman: ...... Woman: Alright. A promise is a promise. Try not to push yourself too hard, dear. Natsume: I won't. Thank you. Woman: I'll stop by again soon. Natsume: Of course. We'll be waiting. Kanna: I know. Kousei: Sorry, I'm not sure I do. Natsume: That woman here just now was our landlady. We need her approval in order to open the cafe. Natsume: She agreed to give us approval if we managed to satisfy her as a customer, but... Kousei: It's not going too well, huh? Natsume: She's already visited us several times, but... we just can't seem to meet her standards. Natsume: That's why we needed the help of someone who knows what good coffee tastes like. So we can improve our blend. Kousei: You mentioned something about the end of the month too... Natsume: We've only been allowed to rent this place temporarily, you see. Although our initial agreement was set to expire in the summer, we managed convince her to give us until October, but... Kousei: Still no luck. Natsume: Unfortunately not. Natsume: I think I need to take a break for a bit. Is that alright? Kanna: Ah--yes, of course. Natsume: Thanks. I'll leave the rest to you. Kousei: ...... Kanna: You could say that. Right now, she's on the verge of giving up on something very important herself. At this rate-- Kousei: Her soul will end up lingering the world of the living? Kanna: It's possible, yes. But if we can manage to open this cafe, we might just be able to prevent that. Kousei: She didn't seem particularly supportive, though. Kanna: I wouldn't say she's been unkind to us either. Kousei: Well at any rate, the point is that she isn't satisfied as a customer, right? Kousei: Does she only have a problem with the coffee? What about the other menu items? Kanna: We did have her try our omelet rice one time. Mikado: And our black tea, as well. Kousei: Omelet rice and black tea, huh... Kousei: I'd like to see how those taste too, if that's okay. Would you mind? Mikado: Kanna can prepare the omelet rice for you, but Natsume was the one who made the tea. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Incidentally, what exactly is your job going to be? Mikado: I will be charge of making drinks. I'm already proficient in brewing both coffee and tea. Kousei: I-I see... Kanna: Of course. Leave it to me. Kanna: Please watch over things while I whip up a prototype, Mikado-san. Mikado: Understood. Kanna: Come, Takamine-san. Let's head over to the kitchen, shall we? Kanna: Now then, let's get started. Kanna: We'll need a couple eggs, an onion, some chicken... Kanna: I told you I had a lot of practice. Did you not believe me? Kousei: That's not it, but... Kousei: Do Grim Reapers even need to eat food like regular people to survive? Kanna: It is possible for us to survive without eating, since we're sustained by the power of God. Kanna: But survival isn't everything. If we didn't eat, our souls would weaken... and our physical health would suffer as well. Kousei: Huh. I see. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Was I scowling or something? Sorry. I didn't mean to. Kanna: No, no. I didn't mean it like that. Kanna: It just feels like all my cooking skills are being put to the test... That's why it's a little scary. Kousei: No pressure. This is all just practice too. Kanna: I suppose you're right... Kanna: Here you are! The results of hours upon hours of omelet rice practice! Kousei: Wow, it came out beautifully. This is some restaurant-level quality. Kousei: Actually, I prefer my ketchup spread evenly over the egg... Kanna: Ahh?! What about all my hard work?! Kousei: It's great. Kanna: You really mean it? Kousei: There wouldn't be any point in complimenting you for the sake of it. My life depends on how many customers we can attract, after all. Kousei: It tastes great. It's hard to put into words, but... it has a really gentle flavor. Like a lot of care was put into making it. Kanna: You think so? Well I'm glad you like it. Kousei: I'd have no problems paying for something like this. Omelet rice might be a personal favorite of mine, but I'd definitely order this again sometime. Kousei: It wouldn't even be surprised if it becomes our signature dish. Kanna: ...... Kanna: I'm... very happy to hear you say that. Very, very happy. Kousei: ...... Kousei: There's no need to look that flattered. Kanna: *giggle* Don't say that. A real man has to take responsibility for the compliments he gives. Kousei: Still, I'm only giving you my amateur opinion. I can't guarantee this'll actually sell well. Kanna: But you weren't lying just to spare my feelings, were you? Kousei: No. I really would love to eat this again sometime. Kanna: That's good to hear. Kousei: You must have had to practice a lot to make something this delicious, huh? Kanna: Yes, you could say that... It definitely wasn't easy. Kanna: But that's why it makes me so happy to hear how much you enjoyed it. Kanna: Really... really happy... "

            "Mei: Good morning! Natsume: Good morning. Kanna: Good morning. How was yesterday? Mei: I'm sorry? Natsume: She's talking about your date with Takamine-kun. Mei: My... WHAT? Kanna: You went somewhere together, didn't you? Mei: W-Well, yeah... Natsume: He didn't do anything stupid, did he? Kanna: We were worried that he'd get too carried away and blow his chance. Natsume: Yeah. He seems like the kind of guy to get way too worked up over a date. Mei: Wait, what? What? Suzune: Whoa there. Don't go having this conversation without me! Mei: Ah... Suzune-san. Good morning. Suzune: Good morning. So? You guys were talking about yesterday? Natsume: Yes. Suzune: How was it? How far did you two go? Mei: H-How far? Kanna: Jumping straight into it, are we? Suzune: I know you're just as curious as I am. I mean, they've basically seen each other naked now, no? Mei: WHAT?! Natsume: Wait, really? You've already done THAT? Mei: Oh, no! No, no, no! I mean--WHAT?! Suzune: Okay, maybe that was a bit misleading. I just meant they've seen each other in swimsuits. Mei: A bit?! That was EXTREMELY misleading! Kanna: Oh... so you went swimming? At a hot spring? Mei: We went swimming, yes, but at a pool... Natsume: Really? I didn't know they were already open at this time of year. Suzune: I think she means the big one nearby. It's a heated indoor swimming pool. Natsume: Oh, that sounds like a nice place to go to on a date. Mei: Actually, we went to the one by the station... Suzune: Wait, there's a pool by the station? When did they build that? Natsume: It must have a hot spring built in too. If it's by the station, I should go check it out myself sometime. Mei: Umm... No, it's not that sort of pool. It's a gym... Natsume: What? A gym? Mei: Yes. Like, a fitness center... Kanna: You went to a fitness center together? Mei: Yes... That is indeed where we went. Suzune: Oh. I thought for sure you went to a recreational pool to mess around and have fun. Mei: We just went to do some exercise. Separately... Kanna: Separately? Natsume: That... doesn't sound like much of a date. Suzune: More like a workout, than anything. Kanna: That's rather disappointing... Mei: Wh-What do you mean? It wasn't supposed to be a date! Suzune: Oh, come on. Don't be shy. Mei: I'm telling you, it wasn't a date! Suzune: Psh. That's lame. Mei: H-How? Natsume: A gym, huh? Well, I can certainly see that, coming from you. Mei: ...... Kanna: What's the matter? Mei: No, it's just... I feel a little dumb about the whole thing... Natsume: What for? Mei: The truth is, Senpai thought we were going to a recreational pool as well, but the idea hadn't crossed my mind at all... Suzune: Ahh. So Kousei was the only one who thought it was a date. Mei: N-No, I don't think that's the case... Mei: But still, he was absolutely right. We shouldn't have gone to a fitness center pool... Natsume: Oh, okay. So you wish you'd picked a better place for a date as well. Mei: F-For the last time, it wasn't a date! Kanna: Then allow me to be frank. How do you feel about him? Mei: Who? Kanna: Takamine-san, of course. Mei: Huh? Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What do you mean by that? Natsume: That reaction already says it all. Mei: N-No, I just, um... I have a lot of respect for him. Natsume: Respect? Mei: Y-Yes. Natsume: You... respect him? Kanna: Please don't look so bewildered. I feel bad for him now. Natsume: Sorry. Suzune: You respect him, nothing more? Mei: Huh? Well, um... I guess it's not only that... Mei: But... it's mostly respect... I think... Suzune: Hmm. Suzune: ...... Suzune: Nozomi-san's coming in today, isn't she? Kanna: Yes. Her shift starts at lunch. Suzune: Good. Are you all busy tonight? Natsume: Not particularly. Kanna: I don't have any plans either. Suzune: Well, if Nozomi-san's free as well, let's have a girls' night out! Suzune: Against the four of us, Mei-san doesn't stand a chance. Mei: Wait! What are you going to do to me?! Kanna: That's a great idea. Natsume: Sounds like fun. Mei: What? Huh? Why? Suzune: ...... Mei: Wh-What? Why are you grinning at me like that? Seriously, what? Suzune: Alright! Time to get to work, everybody! Kanna: Let's get down to it! Natsume: I'm looking forward to tonight. Mei: Wait, what? Hold up. Mei: Seriously? Kousei: See you guys later. Natsume: See you. Suzune: Where do you girls want to go? Should we find a restaurant somewhere? Kousei: Oh, are you all going out to eat? Kanna: We're having a girls' night out tonight. Nozomi: I can't wait. *giggle* Mei: ...... Kousei: Is it just me, or is Hiuchidani-san the only one not very excited about it? Natsume: Don't be silly. She's totally excited. Right? Mei: Yes. I am very excited. Kousei: Huh. Could've fooled me. Suzune: Actually, why don't we just go to my place? We'll have a hard time finding any places open this late. Natsume: True. We can just stop by a convenience store on the way and buy something there. Suzune: Alright. Let's get going. Suzune: Oh, and no boys allowed, so go kill some time before you follow us home, Kousei. Kousei: Huh? But if we're all going to the same apartment complex, why can't I just-- Suzune: No can do. Our girls' night out is already underway. Kousei: Fine. Suzune: Come on, girls. Let's go. Nozomi: Okaay. Mei: ...... Kousei: You alright, Hiuchidani-san? Mei: ...... Kousei: I'm gonna take that as a \"no.\" Suzune: Come on, Mei-san. Mei: Okay... Kousei: ...... Kousei: Weird. Suzune: Anyone want a beer? Natsume: I'm fine. Kanna: No, thank you. Suzune: Oh, well. More for me. Nozomi: Uh, so I forgot to ask, but why exactly are we having a girls' night out anyway? Suzune: So we can interrogate Mei-san about her relationship with Kousei. Nozomi: Her relationship with Kousei-kun? Mei: I wanna go home. Suzune: Aww, c'mon. We won't ask you anything too invasive. Just play along with us for tonight. Mei: *sigh*... What do you want to know? Kanna: In all honesty, how do you feel about Takamine-san? Mei: Cutting right to the chase, huh. I already answered that this morning, didn't I? Kanna: You said you respected him, but is that really all there is to it? Mei: I mean... Nozomi: Did something happen between them? Natsume: They went out somewhere together yesterday. Nozomi: Oh, phew. That's not bad... Suzune: What do you mean? Nozomi: I was afraid they'd gotten into a fight or something. Suzune: Oh, no. Just the opposite. They've actually been getting quite chummy lately. Nozomi: Oh, really? Natsume: How do you feel about all this, Sumizome-san? You're his childhood friend. Nozomi: He's never really been popular with girls, so honestly... I think it's great! It feels like my little Kousei-kun is finally growing up! Kanna: It almost sounds like you're talking about him as a brother. Nozomi: Well, we have known each other for a long time. That's just what happens. Kanna: There's your answer. Mei: What? Seriously, what? How do you want me to respond to that? Suzune: Let me be serious with you for a moment. Mei: Um, okay. Suzune: Whenever you have men and women working in the same place, it often presents a unique problem. Mei: Okay? Suzune: See, it's fine if they get along well, but if things turn sour, that can affect the atmosphere of the entire workplace, reducing productivity. Suzune: In order to avoid such things, it's therefore important for me to have a clear understanding of my coworkers' interpersonal relationships. Mei: Oh. I think I get that... Mei: ...... Mei: Did you really need to invite everyone else here for that, though? Suzune: Nope. Mei: What? Suzune: I just thought it'd be funner with more people. Mei: Seriously? Suzune: I won't deny that I'm doing this for amusement, but I also want to support you. Suzune: All you guys feel that way too, right? Natsume: Well, half that, and half out of curiosity. Kanna: I came 100\\% out of curiosity. Nozomi: In that case, I came 100\\% to support you! Suzune: See? Mei: Oh, uh... Thanks? Natsume: To be honest, like Suzune-san said, I want to know how things are going between you two as well--even though it's not really any of my business. Natsume: The cafe is just a really important place to me, so I'd hate for there to be any problems caused by interpersonal relationships. Natsume: Maybe I'm just a cynic, but I feel like it's all too easy for office romances to lead to those sorts of conflicts. Mei: Romance? Umm... I had a feeling that's where this was going, but, like... Natsume: Am I wrong? Mei: I don't think things between me and him are... like that. Kanna: You don't sound very confident. Mei: I mean, I don't have any experience with relationships, so I don't really know... Suzune: It definitely seems like you've got chemistry, though. From what I've seen, at least. Mei: Chemistry? Kanna: I agree. You become much more animated when you're talking with Takamine-san compared to when you talk with us. Mei: I-Is that true? I've never realized that myself... Natsume: I'd go so far as to say your eyes start to sparkle... maybe? Well, you get the idea. Suzune: You always go \"Senpai, Senpai!\" in such a cheerful voice. Whenever you're with Kousei, you seem even more upbeat than usual. Mei: What? Seriously? Natsume: What do you think, Sumizome-san? Have you noticed any recent changes in Takamine-kun's behavior? Nozomi: Hmm... I don't know. They definitely get along well, that's for sure. Nozomi: Ah--but I guess he seems a lot more... relaxed whenever he's around Mei-chan. Compared to Natsume-san and Kanna-san, for example. Natsume: True. He won't even sit beside me in class. Nozomi: Not a surprise. He's not really used to dealing with girls. Nozomi: But when he's with Mei-chan, I feel like he's more comfortable acting natural. Natsume: Hmm. I guess part of it might have to do with her being younger. Suzune: Not all the time, though. Yesterday he was all restless and fidgety. Mei: What? He was? Suzune: Yep. He was having a bit of trouble concentrating on work. Suzune: It made me smile, but he also kind of needed to get his act together. Suzune: So in all seriousness, the sooner you two sort out your feelings, the happier I'll be. Mei: Urk... Easier said than done... Kanna: It's almost Valentine's Day too. The timing couldn't be better. Nozomi: Oh, Valentine's Day! Are we doing anything special at the cafe? Natsume: Hopefully. Suzune-san and I are still figuring out what, though. Suzune: We'll probably do another limited-time special like we did on Christmas. I doubt it'll be as hectic this time around, though. Nozomi: True. People don't usually buy their Valentine's chocolates from cake shops. Suzune: If only chocolate had a longer shelf life. But yeah, that's why it's just going to be a limited-time thing, for girls to buy for their acquaintances and such. Suzune: You know, friend-chocolate. Kanna: Oh, that's right! I nearly forgot to ask. What should we do about OUR chocolates? Natsume: You mean for Takamine-kun? Kanna: Yes. And Mikado-san too. I wasn't sure if we should give our male coworkers chocolates. Nozomi: Why don't we give them one big gift, from all of us? That way it'll be easier for them to prepare a return gift too, as opposed to having to buy a gift for each of us individually. Natsume: Good idea. He'd probably be disappointed if we didn't get him anything. Suzune: In that case, Mei-san can get him something a little more personal. Mei: Gosh, why do we keep going here? Suzune: Well, it's either that or you pitch in with the rest of us. Which do you want? Mei: Well... I mean... Urk... Suzune: See? You don't want to, do you? Mei: Well, I mean... he does a lot for me, so, like... Mei: If I'm going to give him something... I want it to be from ME. Natsume: That's the only reason? Mei: Urk... Kanna: Oh? You're not denying it. Mei: I don't know what you want me to say... Mei: Ngh! Mei: I really don't know. I mean, I do l-like him, of course... Mei: But I just like him as a person... I don't know if that means I l-love him or not. Suzune: Ahhh! So adorbs! My heart can't take it! Natsume: God, what's gotten into you? Are you drunk? Suzune: A little. Kanna: Let me ask you this then. If Takamine-san started getting chummy with another girl, how would that make you feel? Mei: Hmm... Natsume: Out of all of us, I'd say he's closest to Sumizome-san, right? Nozomi: I guess, considering how long we've known each other. Suzune: Do you ever feel like there's a side of him only you know about? Nozomi: Something only I know? Let me think... Nozomi: His face when he wakes up, I guess? Kanna: You're not talking about what I think you are, are you? Nozomi: No, not like that. He gets up early by himself now, but I used to have to come over every morning to wake him up. Suzune: Ahh. I have a younger brother too, so I know what that's like. He'd always whine and yell when I yanked off his covers. Nozomi: Yeah... I once made the mistake of doing that too... Natsume: Why was it a mistake? Nozomi: You know how in the morning, guys get... um, you know... Suzune: Morning wood? Nozomi: Oh my god! You just outright said it! Mei: Morning what? Suzune: It's when guys get an uncontrollable erection in the morning. Mei: ...... Mei: Ahh! Suzune: Gee, what an adorable reaction. Nozomi-san, on the other hand, seems like she's pretty used to it. Nozomi: I wouldn't really say that. I've just happened to see it a few times, is all... Suzune: Oh-ho. So you've seen his erect ding-a-ling \"a few times,\" have you now? Natsume: His what? Kanna: She's definitely drunk, alright. Nozomi: I-It wasn't on purpose or anything, okay? It just happened on rare occasions when I came to wake him up... Suzune: Well, how does it feel knowing another woman's seen his, um... his wing-dang-doodle, Mei-san? Natsume: Excuse me? Kanna: You're a terrible drunk, Suzune-san. Suzune: Go ahead and tell us. Another woman's seen his private parts. How does that make you feel? Mei: Urk... Mei: Ngh... Mei: Nghhh! Mei: ...... Mei: It makes me feel... a little put out... I guess. Suzune: So you do have some feelings for him, deep down. Mei: Urk... I don't know... Suzune: Well, if you're planning to make him some homemade chocolate, let me know. I'll teach you everything you need to know. Mei: Homemade? But that'd totally make it seem like I... you know. Natsume: Like you're confessing to him, right. Mei: He might think I'm being too clingy, though... Nozomi: I don't know about that. I think he'd be thrilled. Suzune: So what do you say? Wanna make some homemade chocolate? Mei: Homemade chocolate... to confess my feelings... Homemade chocolate... Mei: Urk... Nghhhh! Mei: Ngh. Nozomi: M-Mei-chan? Natsume: She collapsed. Kanna: Her face is red as a beet too. Mei: I can't think straight anymore... My head's about to explode... Suzune: Aww, look at her. Acting all flustered like a young girl in love. Natsume: I feel like it's mostly your fault she's like this. Suzune: Sorry, she's just too cute. I can't help but tease her. Mei: Please, just let me go home already... I'm really not good with these sorts of conversations... Kanna: I know I said I only came because I was curious, but if you really are planning to confess to Takamine-san, I'll be glad to assist in any way I can. Kanna: I'd love for you two to be happily together. Nozomi: Me too! Let me know if there's anything I can do. Natsume: Alright. I think it's time we put this conversation to rest. It doesn't look like Hiuchidani-san can take much more. Mei: I can't... I'm about to die from embarrassment... Suzune: Man, what I wouldn't give to be young again... Kanna: What are you talking about? You're still plenty young. Suzune: There's a world of difference between being a student and being a working adult. Suzune: Time'll pass by before you know it, Mei-san. Make sure you don't leave any regrets behind. Mei: Urk... Alright. I'll try to think about how I really feel... Suzune: Honestly, though, it's already pretty clear to the rest of us. Kanna: That's just how love works. The person themselves can oftentimes be oblivious to the fact. Natsume: Very true. Nozomi: You three talk like you know a lot. You must have a ton of dating experience, huh? All Three: ...... Nozomi: Why did you all look away? Do you... not? Natsume: Anyway, why don't we start discussing our Valentine's Day menu? Suzune: Sounds like a great idea! Kanna: Indeed! Nozomi: Oops... I guess I shouldn't have asked. Mei: Urk... Mei: Do I really like him... that way? Mei: ...... Mei: Urk... I don't know! Ngh! Mei: G-Good morning! Kousei: What did you do to her yesterday? Suzune: Nothing. We just had a little chat. Kousei: ...... Suzune: Why are you giving me that look? Kousei: Because she's clearly acting weird. Suzune: Well, it's obvious why... Suzune: ...... Kousei: What do you mean? Suzune: Well, maybe I do owe her an apology. Kousei: What? Suzune: I might've teased her a little too much. Kousei: Huh? Suzune: Well, thankfully, we might see some progress now. Kousei: What progress? Suzune: You'll see soon enough. And you'd better thank me when it happens. Kousei: When what happens? Suzune: Uh-oh. Our orders are starting to pile up. Better get back to work. Kanna: Actually, Takamine-san, could I ask you and Mei-san to stay behind for a little while? Mei: Huh? Suzune: Hold on. What are you doing? Kanna: This doesn't have anything to do with what we discussed yesterday. I just need to talk to them about their shifts. Suzune: Oh, okay. Suzune: Well, see you all tomorrow! Natsume: Bye, everyone. Kanna: No, of course not. Kousei: I thought so. This is about Hiuchidani-san's eye, isn't it? Mikado: Yes, indeed. Mei: I forgot to ask before, but does anyone at the cafe else know about my eye? Mikado: Natsume knows. Suzune and Nozomi do not, however. Mei: Natsume-san san knows too? That's a relief. Kanna: Still, I must advise you not to speak with her about it too carelessly. We wouldn't want anyone overhearing you by accident. Mei: Alright. Mikado: How are things going with your eye? Mei: Nothing much has changed. Mikado: Which means you haven't found a way to release your butterflies yet? Mei: Err... No, not yet. Kanna: We haven't had many opportunities to practice, after all. Would you like to do some now? Mei: Sure. Mei: But that being said... Mikado: You said you are able to capture butterflies simply by staring at them, correct? Mei: Yeah. After I stare at them for a while, they just disappear. Kanna: In that case, perhaps you could do the opposite, and try staring at an empty space while imagining them appearing. Mei: Imagine them appearing? Mei: Nghhh... Mei: ...... Mei: It's not working. Kousei: What about other people who had the eye? How did they release their butterflies? Mikado: Well, if we knew that, we would not be having this problem. Kousei: Good point. But haven't any other Grim Reapers documented it? Kanna: We've tried searching for more information, but no such luck. Kanna: And to the best of my knowledge, Mei-san is the only person who possesses the eye yet can't see the butterflies. Kousei: So she's an anomaly? Mikado: We don't know that either. People who possess the eye are rare enough in and of themselves. There is simply not enough information. Mikado: That is precisely what makes her such an interesting case study. Kousei: You make her sound like some kind of guinea pig... Mei: That's okay. I want to find out everything I can about my eye as well. Mei: If anything, I should be the one apologizing for being so unhelpful... Kanna: If only I could use my scythe to retrieve the butterflies from your eye... Kousei: You can't? Kanna: I don't dare try. It could end up causing unforeseen damage to Mei-san's soul. Kanna: Perhaps if I knew exactly where the butterflies were located, I might be able to do something about it, but I don't. Mikado: We are no longer able to sense butterflies that have been captured by the eye. Mikado: That is why we did not realize that Mei possessed the eye in the first place. Kousei: Interesting. Kanna: I just had an idea, Mei-san. Mei: Yes? Kanna: Whenever you capture butterflies, is there anything in particular that you think of? Mei: Something I think of? Hmm... I'm not really sure... Kanna: So you do it without thinking? Mei: Well... I guess I think to myself, \"Go away!\" or something like that. Mei: But the very first time I ever noticed a wisp... Mei: ...... Mei: I was mostly just curious. \"What is that?\" I thought, and so I kept staring at it until it disappeared. Mei: That's what crossed my mind the first time it happened, at least. Kanna: Just curiosity... Kousei: So then if she does the opposite, and tries NOT to think about the butterflies, she'll be able to release them? Mikado: You realize that, until just recently, she had no idea that there were even butterflies inside her? Kousei: Oh, right. I guess she hasn't been thinking about them this whole time. I wonder what it is she needs then? Kanna: Maybe what she needs is... something more concrete. Mei: What do you mean? Kanna: If, by thinking about \"butterflies\", you are able to capture them... Kanna: Then perhaps by focusing your thoughts on a specific \"place\", you'll be able to release them. Mei: Oh. So instead of just vaguely trying to release them anywhere, I should try to think about releasing them towards someplace specific? Kanna: Why don't you give it a shot? Mei: Alrighty! Mei: Ngh... Mei: Nghh! Mei: C'mon, the chair... The chair! Mei: Nggghhhhh! Mikado: It doesn't seem to be working. Mei: I'm sorry... Kanna: Maybe you aren't focusing hard enough... or maybe I'm just completely wrong. Kanna: Hmm... Kanna: Your Excellency. Mikado: Yes? Kanna: Please turn into your cat form. Mikado: I beg your pardon? Kanna: Please turn into your cat form. Mikado: I refuse. Kanna: Please turn into your cat form. Mikado: You can repeat yourself however many times you wish, but no means no! Kanna: Please! I'm sure this will work! Remember that Mei-san has an abnormal fixation with cats. Mikado: I will not! Mei: A-Abnormal fixation? That's mean... Kousei: Well... she's not wrong. Mei: You too, Senpai?! Kousei: I mean... you turn pretty crazy whenever you see a cat. Kanna: To put it bluntly, you turn into a complete maniac. Mei: W-Wow! You're so mean! Kanna: We've got nothing to lose by trying. Please, Your Excellency! This is for Mei-san's sake! Mikado: Kgh... Very well. But you had best keep yourself under control this time, Mei. Mei: Don't worry! I will, I promise! Mikado: I do not believe you! Kanna: Please, Your Excellency. Hurry it up! Mikado: Fine... Have your wish! Mei: Ahhhhhhh! Mikado: Mei! Have you already forgotten your promise?! Mei: R-R-Relax! I-I'm fine! I-I'm completely calm! Kousei: That look in your eyes begs to differ... Kanna: This is just a guess... but Mei-san seems like the kind of person stray cats run from. Mei: How did you know? It's true; even cats that are used to people always run away from me! I wonder why? Mikado: Is it not painfully obvious? Kanna: Now then, Mei-san. Please try imagining your butterflies being released around His Excellency. Mei: R-Right! A-Around His Excellency! Y-Yes! O-Of course! Mikado: I do not wish to be rude, Mei, but I find your behavior most repulsive right now. Kousei: That's about as rude as it gets, though. Mei: I don't mind! He can call me repulsive as much as he wants! Kousei: You've got problems, Hiuchidani-san. Seriously. Mei: A-Anyway, here I go! Mikado: Very well. But you can do it standing from there. Do not come any closer, you hear? Mei: A-Alright! *pant*... *pant*... Mikado: ...... Mei: *pant*... *pant*! Mikado: Why are you breathing so heavily? Mei: *PANT*... *PANT*! Mikado: Enough! If this goes on any further, I will not be safe! Mei: *PAAAANT*! Kanna: Alright, Mei-san. Settle down, settle down. Mei: Huh? It's over? My time's up already? Wait! How much do I have to pay for an extension?! Mikado: What on earth is this child talking about? Kousei: Well, I guess that didn't work either. Kanna: My idea must've been wrong. I suppose we'll have to think this over some more. Mei: Five thousand yen! I'll pay five thousand yen! Mikado: That is quite enough. Playtime is over. Mei: Ahh... He's gone... Mikado: Good grief. I am beginning to suspect that this derangement of yours is a side effect of using your eye... Mei: What do you mean? I was totally calm and collected. Kousei: ...... Kanna: ...... Mikado: I believe you have something to say to me, Mei. Mei: Okay, fine! I'm sorry! Kanna: Anyway, why don't we stop here for today? Mikado: Before we do, though, I must ask. Have you captured any other butterflies lately besides the ones in the cafe? Mei: No. I haven't used my powers at all outside of the cafe. Mikado: Alright. Very well. Kanna: If that's all, then we'll see you-- Mei: Actually, can I ask one more thing? Mikado: Yes? Mei: Is it possible that using my eye... could have a negative effect on the person? Kanna: You mean when you use it to capture butterflies? Mei: Yeah. You said that it had the power to heal people's souls, but, um... how do I put this... Kousei: For example, if a person's soul was weakened because of a physical problem, healing their soul wouldn't resolve the underlying issue. Kousei: On the contrary, healing only their soul might have a negative effect on their body. Kousei: I think that's what Hiuchidani-san means to say. Mei: R-Right. That's it. Thank you. Mikado: Hmm... It is difficult to say for certain. Mei: In that case, isn't it kind of risky for me to be using my eye on our customers? Mikado: Perhaps. But it is also better than doing nothing. Mikado: There have been no instances of any customers returning to the cafe with new butterflies after you captured their old ones. Mikado: As of this moment, we have no reason to believe that the power of your eye has any negative effect on others. Mei: Oh... Kanna: Did something happen that caused you to think that it might? Mei: N-No, not exactly... Mei: ...... Mei: It's just... I feel like I've been getting a little carried away ever since I learned the truth about my eye, and learned that there were other people that understood me. Mei: If it turns out that my eye is causing others harm, though... I'd rather just stop using it altogether. Mikado: It is I who tasked you with capturing other people's butterflies. If there truly are any negative consequences of doing so, it would be my responsibility to bear. Mikado: So do not worry. Thanks to you, our job of collecting butterflies has been going remarkably smoothly. That is a fact. Mei: Okay. Thank you for saying that. Kanna: Are there any other questions you'd like to ask? Mei: No, that's all. Kanna: In that case, I'll see you both tomorrow. Good night. Mikado: Good night. Make sure you get plenty of rest. Mei: We will. Good night! Kousei: Good night. Kanna: ...... Mikado: Are you still worried? Kanna: I'm a little relieved, actually, knowing that Mei-san has her own reservations about using her eye. Mikado: I've never been worried about that myself. Despite appearances, she is a very rational-- Mikado: ...... Kanna: Struggling to finish that sentence, aren't you? Mikado: Allow me to rephrase. Although she tends to lose her head under certain circumstances, she is generally a very compassionate person. Mikado: She is the sort of person who would never even think about abusing the power of her eye. Kanna: I'm not worried about that either. I trust Mei-san completely. Kanna: What worries me is... something else. Mikado: We've already warned her many times not to let anyone realize the truth about her eye. Kanna: I know. Of course, times have changed now, but still... Mikado: People's hearts remain largely the same. Kanna: That's why I was against using her eye in the first place. Kanna: There may not be any problems right now, but if things start to fall apart, Mei-san will be the one to suffer. Kanna: And all the positive influence she's been having on Takamine-san's soul will be for naught. Kanna: If anything were to happen to Mei-san, Takamine-san would undoubtedly be greatly affected as well. Mikado: Hmm. So it is not Mei, but Takamine Kousei you are worried about? Kanna: I'm worried about them both. But... I realize I may just be feeling overprotective. Kanna: If you wish for her to have full control over the power of her eye, I won't object. Rest assured. Mikado: I understand that you are concerned, but we cannot allow these butterflies to simply remain inside of Mei either. Kanna: I know. Mikado: Incidentally, Kanna. Kanna: Yes? Mikado: What exactly was it that you and Mei spoke about yesterday? I understand you and the others had a \"girls' night out.\" Kanna: Tsk, tsk. How rude, Your Excellency. You mustn't ask a young lady to divulge her secrets. Mikado: Ah. So it was nothing of importance then. Kanna: Nihihi. Nope. Just a little gossip between girls, is all. Kanna: I do hope everything works out between those two, though... Mei: Oh... yeah. It's been weighing on my mind for a while now. Mei: The truth is, I've been getting a little carried away ever since His Excellency gave me this task. Mei: I'm worried that I've only been adding to people's troubles, like I did to her. Mei: I was starting to question whether capturing our customer's wisps was the right thing to do. Kousei: Hmm... It's hard to say. Mei: Yeah. It is. Kousei: But you know, I've been thinking as well. Kousei: I suggested that maybe this friend of yours had a physical problem, and that's why she still hasn't gotten better. Kousei: But after you'd cast your \"magic spell\" on her, you saw a significant improvement in her mood, didn't you? Mei: Yeah. While I wouldn't say she recovered completely, there was definitely a big improvement. Kousei: If that's true, then it must be some sort of emotional problem. That's why the power of your eye was able to cheer her up temporarily. Kousei: And in that case, there's no doubt in my mind that your \"magic spell\" provided her with some much-needed relief. Kousei: While it's unfortunate that she ended up becoming overly dependent on it, it's clear that the weight in your friend's heart was lightened because of you. Kousei: If I had to say whether it was the right or wrong decision, I'd have to say it was right. Kousei: So I don't think there's anything you should feel guilty or anxious about. Kousei: The power in your left eye is unmistakably a power that helps others. And I'm certain it'll help a lot more people from now on. Mei: ...... Kousei: Uh... sorry. Maybe it's not my place to say anything. Mei: N-No, don't apologize... Mei: ...... Mei: C-Can you read my mind, Senpai? Kousei: Huh? Mei: It makes me really happy... You always seem to know exactly what I want to hear. Mei: It almost feels like you know exactly what I'm thinking all the time. Kousei: Nah... I'm not that sensitive, to be honest. In fact, I can be downright insensitive sometimes. Kousei: But one thing I will say is that I'm not saying these things just to cheer you up. Kousei: I mean it. All of it. Kousei: The stuff about me being grateful to you, and the stuff about your eye--you, helping other people. Kousei: I mean all of it, from the bottom of my heart. Kousei: And if I managed to get that message across to you, well... then that'd make me happy too. Mei: ...... Kousei: Sorry if I seem like I'm trying too hard to be cool or something. I'm lame, I know. Mei: N-No! You're really not... Mei: ...... Mei: U-Umm! Kousei: Hm? Mei: Do you like sweets, Senpai? Kousei: Huh? What's this about? Mei: Do you? Kousei: Well, sure, I guess. Mei: Okay, great! Good night! Kousei: Huh? O-Oh. Yeah, g'night. Mei: Thanks for walking me home! See you tomorrow! Kousei: R-Right. See you tomorrow... Mei: ...... Mei: Hi, Suzune-san? It's me, Mei. I'm sorry for the random call... Mei: Um, I was wondering something... Mei: ...... Mei: C-Could you teach me how to make my own chocolate? "

            "Kanna: I'm ready. Kousei: This isn't even that bad, actually. Kanna: Nozomi-san must be running ragged with all these visitors. Kousei: Yeah. She's probably busy working as we speak. Kanna: Let's just wish her a quick Happy New Year so that we don't bother her too long. Kousei: Good idea. Kousei: Oh, I almost forgot. Mikado explained your disappearance to the others by telling them you had to go home because of some family matters. Kousei: So if they ask you about, just give some vague explanation and change the topic. Kanna: Got it. Kousei: Yeah. The sauce and stuff smells amazing. Kousei: The food's a bit expensive, but there's just something too tempting about it to pass up. Kanna: Do you think we should participate next year? Kousei: Hmm... I bet Suzune-san could whip up some kind of crepe or something if we talked to her about it. Kousei: Not that we'd have to wait until next year, though. We could always try participating in the summer festival. Kousei: I'll look into it. Kousei: (I promise we'll be happy. Rest assured.) Kousei: Me? I didn't really wish for anything. Kousei: All I did was thank the gods for reuniting me with you. That's pretty much it. Kanna: You didn't wish for anything about our future together? Kousei: That's not something I need to ask God for. Kousei: Even without his help, I plan on making you happy. Kanna: A-Ahaha... Hearing you say that is kind of embarrassing. Kanna: But... thank you. I really appreciate that. Kanna: And in return, I'll do my best to make you happy as well, Kousei-san. Kousei: Thanks. Kanna: Yes? Ah, Natsume-san! Happy New Year! Natsume: Happy... New Year... Natsume: B-But how are you here?! I thought... Kanna: Well, it's a long story... but essentially, you could say... the power of love prevailed. Natsume: I have no idea what that means, but is everything resolved now? Kanna: Yes, everything's okay. I'm sorry for worrying you. Natsume: Oh... Thank goodness. That's wonderful news. Natsume: It's good to have you back. Kanna: Thank you. It's good to be back! Kousei: By the way, Shiki-san. Have you seen Nozomi anywhere? Natsume: I saw her a little while ago talking to Hiuchidani-san just outside the shrine gates. Kousei: Really? Thanks. We'll see if we can catch her. Mei: Man, that outfit really does look amazing on you. Nozomi: You think so? Ehehe... Nozomi: Do you want to try it on too, Mei-chan? You could even start working right away. Mei: Erm... Nah, I think I'm good. I'd rather just admire you shrine maidens from afar. Nozomi: Don't be like that. C'mon, just try it on for a bit! If you don't try it, you'll never know what it's like. Mei: I get the feeling you're just trying to recruit me. Nozomi: What? Well... Ehehe... Nozomi: But I really do think it'll look good on you! Honest. You'd look super cute! Mei: You think so? I don't even have it on, but you're already making me feel embarrassed... Thanks, though. Kousei: Ah, there they are. Mei: Huh? Ah, Senpai! Nozomi: Kanna-san! You're back? Kanna: Yes. I'm sorry for all the trouble. Kanna: But everything's alright now. I hope we all have another great year together. Nozomi: Me too. Mei: Same here. Kousei: Yeah. Nozomi: Heh. Kousei: What? Nozomi: Hm? Nothing. Just glad to see you're feeling better now. Kousei: ...... Nozomi: You might've thought you were doing a good job of hiding it, but you can't hide anything from me. Nozomi: Don't underestimate the power of a childhood friend. Kousei: Sorry. But yeah, I'm fine now. Nozomi: You'd better not keep worrying me even now that you have a girlfriend, okay? Kousei: I won't. Sorry. Nozomi: Good. Nozomi: Alrighty, I'd better get back to work. I'll see you guys later. Mei: Hang in there, Nozomi-chan. Nozomi: Thanks. I will. Mei: I'd better go pray at the shrine too. I haven't had the chance yet, since I got caught up chatting with Nozomi-chan. Kousei: Oh, okay. Mei: Alright. Bye, you two. I'll see you at the cafe! Kanna: See you then! Kousei: Yeah. See ya. Kanna: *giggle*! Kousei: Hmm? Kanna: I'm so happy that I get to talk to everyone again. Kanna: It's starting to sink in... I really am back. Kousei: What, you were still in disbelief? Kanna: I had my doubts, but they finally disappeared while I was talking to the others. Kousei: Was I not good enough? Kanna: Oh, no! I didn't mean that... I just couldn't help but feel like I was dreaming or having some kind of hallucination last night. Kanna: I mean, I was dying to see you and be with you again. Kousei: That kinda makes it sound like the others don't really matter to you. Kanna: Oh, I didn't mean it like that. I care about Natsume-san, Nozomi-san, Mei-san... Kanna: And Suzune-san as well, even though we didn't get to see her today. Kanna: I've lived for a very long time now, but I've never had anyone care about me the way they do. They're all very important friends to me. Kanna: However, you're more than a friend to me, Kousei-san. Kanna: Yes? Kousei: Why don't we move in together? Kanna: ...... Kanna: Okay. Kousei: Are you sure? Kanna: Well... I do love you. And since I do, we're no doubt going to end up living together one day anyway, so... Kanna: It's embarrassing... but I'm not against the idea. Kanna: ...... Kousei: ...... Kousei: Uhh. Kanna: Yesh?! Kousei: Oh, uh... Sorry. Kousei: This is it, I guess. Kanna: Wh-What?! What are we going to be doing?! Kousei: Huh? No, I didn't mean it like that. Kousei: I just meant, you know... this is the start of our new life living together and all. Kanna: W-Well, yes! That it is! Kanna: Thank you for welcoming me to your home... Kousei: No problem. Kanna: Right... The two of us... are going to be living together. Kousei: Uhh. Kanna: Yesh?! Kousei: We should probably do something besides standing here and chatting. Wanna head inside and--  Kanna: Put the head inside?! You want to go straight to penetration already?! With no foreplay or anything?! Kanna: I've always wanted my first time to be somewhat memorable, or at least have a bit more buildup to it-- Kanna: But if nothing else, I really think you should wait until I'm wet enough, otherwise it's going to be extremely painful! Kousei: I was going to ask if you wanted to head inside and relax... you know, inside my apartment. Kanna: R-Right! Of course. We can't just stand around outside chatting all day, can we? Kousei: ...... Kanna: I'm sorry. I'm just really nervous about a myriad of different things, and... urk... Kousei: That's okay. Don't worry about it. Kanna: You're right. We can't just stand in the doorway all day. Alright... Kanna: Pardon... me... Kousei: ...... Kousei: This is going to be your home from now on too. I think it's important to say it right, just so you can get into the habit of it. Kousei: Do you want to try that again? Kanna: I'm... I'm home. Kousei: Welcome home. Kanna: That was kind of embarrassing. Kousei: Yeah, a little. Kanna: But... I'm sure we'll get used to saying it soon enough. Kousei: Yeah. We're gonna be spending a lot of time together. Kanna: Okay. Now it's your turn, Kousei-san. Kousei: Alright. Kousei: I'm home. Kanna: Welcome home. Both: ...... Both: Pfft. Kousei: Alright. Give me a minute to organize my closet a bit. Kousei: In the meantime, though... what should we eat for lunch? Kanna: I'd be happy to cook. What kind of ingredients do you have? Mind if I took a look? Kousei: You're more than welcome to... but err, there's probably not much you can make. Sorry. All I managed to scrape together yesterday was a plate of omelet rice. Kousei: And unfortunately most supermarkets are closed, since it's New Year's Day... Kanna: There's not much... but you've got onions, eggs, and a bit of chicken left. Oh, and coffee too. Kousei: Feel free to have some, if you want. Kanna: Thank you. Hmm... There's also soy sauce and mirin... Seems like you've got the basic seasonings, at least. Kousei: Nozomi uses them a lot. Kanna: In that case, why don't I make oyakodon? It might be a bit light on the meat, though, since there's not much chicken left. Kousei: That's fine. I wouldn't mind oyakodon. Kanna: There's no parsley, but I guess we can do without it. Oh, but you do have some green onions. Kanna: Also... I'd like to have miso soup and a couple other side dishes as well. Kousei: You should be able to get those things at the convenience store, I'd think. Kanna: Probably. I'm going to head out and pick up a few things then. Kousei: I'll come with you. Kanna: N-No, that's okay. I'm feeling a little worked up right now... so I'd like the chance to calm down a bit. Kousei: Alright. Kanna: But just for the record, it's not because I... *mumble* *mumble*... okay? Kousei: Hmm? Did you say something? Kanna: Ngh! Kanna: A-Anyway, I'll be right back! Kousei: Hmm... Kousei: I guess I should air out the mattress before she gets back. Kousei: You can go ahead and take yours first. Kanna: No, that would just be plain rude. You go first, Kousei-san. Kousei: Nah. Since you have longer hair, it's going to take more time to dry afterwards, right? So... Kanna: I... guess so. Well, alright... I'll go first. Kousei: It's the door on your right. Kanna: Okay. I'll try to finish as quickly as I can. Kousei: You don't have to be in a rush. I wouldn't want you catching a cold or anything. Take your time and get yourself warmed up. Kanna: Okay. Kousei: It's a cheap brand, though, so I'm not sure if it's good for women's hair or not. Kanna: I doubt it'll be a problem. Though my hair is quite long, so I might end up using quite a lot of it. Kanna: So let me apologize in advance. Kousei: That's okay. I don't even know if you'll like it. Kousei: But yeah. This apartment is yours too, starting today. Kousei: You can use whatever you want, whenever you want. Kanna: Thank you. That's very nice of you. "

Let's do that. Natsume: I guess I could try advertising the news around campus too. Kousei: I asked Hiroto to do the same, but I bet you'd attract a lot more attention. Suzune: I've printed flyers at my old workplace before. We can print quite a number of copies with just a few thousand yen. Suzune: But I'm not going to have to pay out of my own pocket, am I?

She can be seriously scary when she gets mad. Somei: Why do you want my number then? Oh, are you gonna introduce me to one of your guy friends? Kousei: Hmm. Well, if you're serious, I guess I could introduce you to one of my college buddies. Somei: Wait. Seriously? Kousei: Sure, it's not that big of a deal. Kousei: I won't ask you to do anything for me in return... but maybe you'd be willing to give me some advice? Natsume: How does kissing feel so good? All we're doing is putting our lips together... Natsume: If this is what kissing feels like, then... Female Nurse: Oh? Has your boyfriend already left? Natsume: He came here during his break at work, so he couldn't stay long. Female Nurse: You're a lucky girl. Not many guys would come see their girlfriend every day of the week. Natsume: ...... Female Nurse: Oh, no need to blush. Female Nurse: There's no reason a pretty girl like you shouldn't have a man or two around her arm. You might not think it, but I was quite the playgirl back in my younger days. Natsume: I'm fine with just the one, actually. Female Nurse: Oh, you're more pure-hearted than I expected. Natsume: Anyway, um... there's something I'd like to ask. Female Nurse: What's that? Natsume: If I leave the hospital tomorrow as scheduled, will I be able to go back to my life as usual? Female Nurse: Well, yes. Natsume: So I should be able to take hot baths, and engage in a bit of... ph-physical activity? Female Nurse: That shouldn't be a problem. But it'll also depend on what kind of physical activity you... Female Nurse: Ahh. So THAT'S what you mean. Female Nurse: Most girls your age are interested in those things, all the more so if they have a boyfriend. Heck, back in my younger days, I-- Natsume: Ngh! Female Nurse: Well, maybe another time. But I get it--you can't exactly ask Dr. Miyama a question like that. Alright. I'll try to ask him for you as discreetly as I can. Natsume: I'd, um, appreciate that... Female Nurse: Oh, how I wish I was young like you again. Kousei: ...... Suzune: Try relaxing a bit more, will you? Kousei: Easier said than done. I can't help but worry. Kanna: Did the tests come back okay? Kousei: Yeah, that's what she texted me. Said she was clear to be discharged today. Suzune: Alright. The caprese-style pasta's ready to go out. Kanna: I'll take it. Kanna: Here is your caprese-style pasta. I'll bring you your sachertorte and blend coffee once you've finished. Kanna: Please, enjoy your meal. Mikado: Welcome to Cafe Stella. Hm? Ah, if it isn't Shiki Natsume. Natsume: Hello. Mei: Huh? Oh, it's Natsume-senpai! Welcome back! Nozomi: Welcome back! Natsume: Oh, I didn't know you two were working today. Nozomi: They needed some extra help till you got back. Mei: Plus, we wanted to be here to see you! Boy, I ran here as fast as I could once school let out. Natsume: Ah. Thanks for doing that. Mei: Oh, you don't have to thank us for that! Ahaha. Mei: We've missed you a whole lot this past week. Nozomi: Since they let you out, does that mean you're all good to go now? Natsume: Yeah. I'm fine. Nozomi: Are you sure? You weren't in the hospital for as long as I thought you'd be. Kanna: Health and sickness start with the mind, after all. I'm sure those daily visits from a certain somebody did wonders to speed her recovery. Nozomi & Mei: Ahh. Natsume: You didn't have to say that out loud. Kanna: Welcome back, Natsume-san. Mikado: Welcome back. Natsume: Thanks. I'll be able to get back to work by tomorrow. Mei: What? So soon? You can rest up a little longer, if you need to. Nozomi: Yeah. If you need any help settling back into things, just ask! We're all here for you! Natsume: I will. Thank you, everyone. Kanna: But that's enough about work. You're here as a customer today, aren't you? Mei: Table for one, Miss? Suzune: Ah, look who it is. I had a feeling that's what all the commotion was about. Suzune: Welcome back, Natsume-san. Natsume: Mhm. I'm glad to be back. Kousei: Make it non-alcoholic, please. Bartender: Certainly. Kousei: You okay after all that? I'm surprised you don't have heartburn. Natsume: A small price to pay. Humans can't live without eating good food. Kousei: You seem like you're in a good mood. Natsume: Maybe it's because I just got out of the hospital, but everything tasted so delicious. Kousei: Because... of me? Natsume: Nope. Not quite. Natsume: Not just because of you, but because of everyone. Kousei: You mean everyone at the cafe? Natsume: Yeah. I don't want to sound like I'm still hung up on this, though. Kousei: Don't worry. I'm here to listen. Natsume: See, years ago, whenever I was released from the hospital... people would always stare at me from a distance. Natsume: They didn't exactly treat me like I was helpless, but they always seemed confused, like they didn't know what to say to me. Natsume: And that's why... Bartender: Here you are, ma'am. Kousei: Stop joking about that. Kousei: If it turns out there's actually alcohol in there, I'm going to start worrying about you again. Natsume: Okay, okay. Sorry. I'll stop for today. Kousei: Alright. Let's get you home now. Natsume: ...... Kousei: Natsume? Natsume: Nothing... Kousei: Okay? Kousei: Oh, yeah. Finals are coming up. You feeling confident? You've been pretty busy lately, so you probably haven't had much time to study. Natsume: Well, I'm sure I'll manage. Kousei: Why don't we study together sometime for the class we share? Natsume: Sure. I don't mind. Kousei: ...... Natsume: ...... Kousei: ...... Kousei: What's the matter? Kousei: ...... Kousei: Haha, very funny. I thought I told you to stop joking ar-- Natsume: I'm not joking. And I'm not drunk either. Kousei: ...... Natsume: I want to stay with you... a bit longer... Kousei: Ah, er, sorry. Yeah... Kousei: I just never expected this, so my mind's kinda going haywire right now. So, um... Kousei: Alright. Kousei: I want to be with you too, Natsume. Kousei: *pant*... *pant*... Kousei: ...... Kousei: Nghhh! Kousei: *inhale*... *exhale*... *inhale*... *exhale*... *inhale*... Kousei: %123;*choke*?! Kousei: Er, no. 'Course not. Kousei: *inhale*... *exhale*... Kousei: You look really sexy. Natsume: Ngh... Kousei: Err, sorry. That was supposed to be a compliment. Y-You're not mad, are you? Natsume: No, I'm not. It's just... incredibly embarrassing. Kousei: You really look beautiful, though. Positively stunning. I'm getting turned on just looking at you. Kousei: My bad. Kousei: But, err, instead of that... Kousei: Can I... touch you? Natsume: Are you really going to ask me that now? Take a hint. Kousei: Yeah. Sorry. Natsume: It's my first time, so we need to do a bit more foreplay first. You know, kissing, stuff like that... Kousei: R-Right. Sorry. Kissing... Nhh... Natsume: I wasn't saying for you to kiss me down THERE! Kousei: Huh? Natsume: Why are you surprised?! Is this really news to you?! There's an order to this stuff! Kousei: O-Oh. Sorry. You're right. First things first. Kousei: Please tell me your name and age. Natsume: What am I, interviewing for the casting couch? Natsume: Oh, for crying out loud. You totally ruined the mood now. Natsume: I hope you know how humiliating this is for me. Kousei: I'm sorry. I mean it. I apologize. Kousei: But you gotta understand; this is my first time too! I'm freaking out here! Natsume: Then make it up to me. Nhh... Natsume: Nhhh... Nh, mh... Nhh... Ah... That's the first time. Kousei: Huh? Natsume: The first time you've ever initiated a kiss. Kousei: Yeah, I guess so. Kousei: I'd better pay you back for all the times you've kissed me then... Nhh... Natsume: Ahmph... Hngh... *smack* *kiss*... Nhh... Nh... *kiss* *smooch*... Mhh... Kousei: No, they're perfect. And... super soft. Natsume: Ahh, nhh... Hngh... Nhhh... Kousei: Besides, it doesn't matter whether they're big or small. I don't care about size. Natsume: Is that supposed to be a compliment? Kousei: I dunno, to be honest. I think your boobs might be hypnotizing me. Kousei: They're so soft... and your nipples are such a beautiful pink too... It's really turning me on. Natsume: Well, um, I'm glad to hear it. Kousei: ...... Natsume: Stop staring at me in silence, will you? It's embarrassing. Kousei: Sorry, I didn't mean to. Kousei: *lick* *suck*... Your nipples are delicious, Natsume... Natsume: *pant* *pant*... It didn't hurt... Nhh... *pant*... Natsume: I just didn't expect it to feel this electrifying... *pant*... *pant*... Natsume: What's going to happen to me... if we go even further? Kousei: I don't know either. Kousei: But... I'm past the point of return. Kousei: It's... so pretty... Kousei: Well, I need to get a good look. Kousei: Don't wanna put it in the wrong hole, y'know... Natsume: Yeah, but... It doesn't look weird, does it? Kousei: It's beautiful. Seriously. That's the only word that comes to mind. Kousei: Is that not convincing enough for you? Natsume: No, I never said that... *pant* *pant*... *pant*... Urk... You're just staring so hard... Kousei: ...... Natsume: And now you go all quiet on me again. Kousei: Ah, err, sorry. I'm not doing it on purpose. I just can't tear my eyes away... Natsume: *pant*... *pant*... *pant*... *pant*... Kousei: Your vagina's so amazing. Natsume: Huh? What do you mean? Does it look weird? Kousei: No, of course not. Kousei: It's just, this is my first time doing any of this... All I can say is, it's amazing. Natsume: R-Really? Umm, how else would you describe it? Kousei: Let's see... Natsume: Delicious? What are you... N-No, wait. You're... Don't tell me you're... Ahh! Kousei: Nhh... *smooch* Natsume: Ngghhh?! Kousei: Your pussy? Natsume: Ngh! Don't say it outright! Natsume: You didn't hate putting your mouth on my p-pu... did you? You don't have to force yourself. Kousei: I don't hate it one bit. I love every part of you, Natsume. If anything, I want to lick it even more. Kousei: What about you, though? Do you not want me to lick it? Natsume: It's just... embarrassing. That's the worst part... but I don't mind it. Kousei: Alright. In that case... Natsume: Ahh?! Nghh... Mhh... Urk... Ahh! Kousei: *lick* *lick*... *slurp* Natsume: S-Sto... Not there... Ahh! It's too embarrassing... being licked there... Nhh! Natsume: Ah, *pant* *pant*... Do people usually have to go this far? Kousei: *lick... Not that I'd know... but I'm pretty sure this is a normal part of foreplay. Natsume: I'm just a little worried that you're getting most of your information from porn. Kousei: Well, judging from your reactions, it seems like you like this. Natsume: I mean... Kousei: Can I keep kissing you down here? I want to taste you even more, Natsume. Natsume: You promise you'll stop? Kousei: Sure... If I can pump the brakes in time. Kousei: But sorry in advance if I can't stop myself. I'm already on the verge of losing control as is. Kousei: *lick*... *lick* *slurp*... *kiss* *kiss*... *suck*... Natsume: Ahhh... Ahh, ah, ah... ahhh... Eeek?! Natsume: Ahhh?! Ahh... ah, ah, ah, ahhh! Kousei: I just tried focusing my kisses on a specific spot... *kiss* *suck* *kiss* *lick*... Natsume: Ahhh! W-Wait, not there... Noooo! My body's... tingling so much... Ahhh! Kousei: Nhh... Does it hurt? Natsume: It doesn't hurt, but I'm scared of how much my body's tingling. Kousei: Does that mean you want me to stop? Natsume: No, but... *pant* *pant*... A-Are you going to keep kissing me? Kousei: I thought you said you were scared? Natsume: I... I am... but you want to keep going, don't you? Kousei: Of course. But if you don't want me to, I won't; I'll stop here. Kousei: So tell me what you want, Natsume. Natsume: Urk... I-I know you already know what I'm going to say... Natsume: You're teasing me on purpose, aren't you? Kousei: That's not--completely untrue, I guess. Natsume: Nrgh... Kousei: But I don't want to do anything you don't like. That's the truth. Kousei: That's why I want you to say it clearly. Because once we go any further, I get the feeling I won't be able to stop myself. Natsume: Fine... Fine. Keep going. Natsume: I don't hate how much it tingles. It's a little scary, but I want you to keep going. Keep kissing me down there... Kousei: It's your own fault for being so wet down here. *lick* *lick* *kiss*... Natsume: Maybe, but you're definitely making those sounds on purpose... Ahhhh! Ah, ah, ah... ahh! Kousei: Wow... You just keep getting wetter and wetter... *lick* *smack*... Natsume: Ahhhh! I-I can't help it... You're kissing it in such a lewd way... Mhhhh! Kousei: I can be even lewder, you know. Natsume: Ah, ahh! Nooo... That's so dirty--ahh! Ahhh! Kousei: *suck* *slurp*... *lick* *lick*... *kiss*... Kousei: *kiss* *pant*... *pant*... *lick* *lick*... *kiss* *suck* Natsume: It feels, too good... I-I can't... *pant*... Hnghh! Natsume: What? *pant*... *pant*... S-Sorry... But if you keep kissing me like that, I... Hngghhh! Natsume: I can't, I can't, I can't... It feels too good! Ahhh, ahhh, eek! Kousei: Well, as long as I'm making you feel good, I'm happy... *suck* *lick*... Natsume: K-Keep... Keep licking my p-pu... that spot... Kiss it more. Kousei: *kiss*... *slurp* *suck*... Natsume: Ahhhhhh! Ah, ah, ahhh! Yes! That feels amazing... Ahhhhh! Kousei: Your reactions make me really happy, Natsume... *kiss* *lick* *lick*... *suck*... Natsume: Ah, ah! Nooo... No more... Ngh! I can't take this... Ahh! Natsume: S-Something's coming! Please, stop! Any more and I'll... Ah, ah, ahh! Kousei: Nhh... *suck* *slurp* *lick*... Natsume: Ahhh! I can't... I can't, I can't... ahh... I'm really gonna--! Natsume: Ah, ah, ahhhhhhhhhhhn! Kousei: You came, didn't you? Natsume: *pant*... *pant*... This is my first time... but I feel so happy... *pant* *pant* *pant* *pant*... Natsume: Wow... My head's gone all mushy... *pant* *pant*... Kousei: Should we take a little break? Natsume: Ngh... No... If we wait, I'll start getting scared again... Natsume: So let's keep going... Let's... have s-sex. Kousei: I haven't even put it in, though... Kousei: Wait--huh?! Don't tell me I just lost my virginity without even knowing it?! Natsume: Oh, hush, you idiot. That's not the only part of sex that feels good. Natsume: Just feeling each other's warmth like this... feels incredible... Kousei: Y-Yeah. Right, of course! Natsume: You're not listening to a word I'm saying, are you? Kousei: What do you want me to do? I'm just too excited about finally losing my virginity. Natsume: I mean, I get that, but still. Kousei: And I get to do it with the girl I love too. I couldn't be happier. Kousei: It's the only thing on my mind right now. Kousei: But you're sure about this, right? You want to go all the way with me? Natsume: Yeah. I want to go all the way. So hold me. Hold me tighter. Kousei: Sure thing. Natsume: It's a lot b-bigger than I thought... Kousei: I think I'm pretty average-sized, actually. Natsume: What?! R-Really? Kousei: Anyway... are you ready, Natsume? It's getting harder and harder to hold myself back. Natsume: I'm ready, but I want you to k-kiss me first. Kousei: I-In THIS position?! Natsume: No, you idiot. I don't mean down there... I mean a normal kiss. Nhh... Natsume: Ahh! *pant* *pant*... *pant*... M-My belly... feels so hot... Kousei: Ngh... Holy shit... Natsume: *pant* *pant*... I-It doesn't feel weird for you... does it? Kousei: Not at all. It feels amazing. Kousei: Your pussy is so warm, and the way it's sucking on me... it's squeezing me so tight. Kousei: And yet it's pulling me deeper still... I've never felt anything like this before. Seriously, it's amazing... Natsume: Me too... I've never... felt something so hot, so d-deep inside me before... Hngh... Kousei: Does it hurt? Natsume: A little bit, sure, but don't worry about me. And I doubt you're capable of stopping right now, right? Kousei: Yeah. Natsume: So I want you to kiss me instead. Make me forget about the pain. Keep me distracted. Kousei: Nhh... *kiss* Natsume: Urk... Nhh *kiss* *kiss*... *smooch*... *smack* *slurp*... Natsume: *pant* *pant*... *pant*... It doesn't hurt, so much as it feels strange... Natsume: Having this thing moving around inside of me is... *pant* *pant*... kind of amazing. Is it all the way inside? Kousei: Yeah. I think I'm all the way in. Kousei: I'm gonna start moving. Kousei: Nhh... *kiss* *smack*... Natsume: I love you... Ahhh... *kiss* *slurp*... I love you... *smooch* *swirl*... *kiss* *kiss*... Kousei: Am I moving too much for you? Natsume: N-No, I'm fine... *kiss*... Ahh, *pant* *pant*... It does hurt a little bit, but I can take it. Natsume: Ah, ah, ah... It hurts, but keep going... *pant* *pant*... What is this? Kousei: It makes me happy to know I'm making you feel good, Natsume. Natsume: It feels like I'm being split apart... like my insides are tingling... *pant*... It feels like it hurts, but it feels so good... Natsume: I-I'm... I'm not the only one feeling good, am I? Does it feel good for you? Kousei: Do you really need to ask? Your pussy feels incredible. It's making me go crazy. Natsume: Ahh?! Ah, hngh! N-Not so rough! Ah, ah, ah, ahh! Natsume: It's making... such a dirty sound! Nghhhh! Kousei: I think it's really hot, actually... You don't mind if I keep going, do you? *smooch* Natsume: Nghh... Mhh... *kiss* *kiss* *smack*... *lick* *smooch*... *kiss*... Kousei: I can't stop myself anymore, Natsume! Natsume: I can feel you... Mghh! Twitching, inside me... Nh, ngh! Stirring me up... Ah, ah, ah! Kousei: It feels way too good, kissing you up here and down there. Natsume: Ahhhh! Ah, ah, ah! You're kissing me... even deeper than before! Natsume: Hngh, ahhhh! Ahmph, *kiss* *smooch* *smack*... Nhh! Kousei: I love you, Natsume. I love you. Natsume: I love you too! Ah, ah, ahh... I love you, I love you! Natsume: It feels, so good... I want to stay like this forever... *kiss* *kiss*... *smack* *slurp*... Kousei: Natsume... If you keep kissing me like that... *smack* *kiss* *slurp*... Natsume: But it's distracting me from the pain... *kiss* *kiss* *smack*... *lick* *lick*... Kousei: Nhh! *kiss* *smooch*... *smack* Kousei: Does it hurt? Natsume: N-No... Something's... something's c-coming! It's coming... Ngghh! Natsume: It's my first time, but... Ahhhh! But I can't hold it back--ah! Ah, ah, ah, ah! Kousei: It makes me happier than anything to know that you're feeling good. In fact, it's turning me on even more. Natsume: Urk! At this rate, I'm gonna--mngh! *kiss* *smooch* *smooch* *smack*... *kiss* *kiss* Kousei: *kiss* Nh, mhh, nhh... Natsume: Ahh, I can't, I'm gonna... Ah, ah, ah! Hug me more! Tighter! Kousei: Natsume, I'm-- Natsume: Huh? W-Wait, I just... Ah?! Nooo... If you rub me right now, I'm gonna--! Natsume: Ngghhhh! Natsume: *pant* *pant*... I can't, I'm going crazy... *pant* *pant*... Kousei: Natsume... *kiss* Natsume: Mhhh, *smooch* *smack*... It's no use... Even if you kiss me, I... *smooch* *kiss* *kiss* *slurp*... Kousei: Hang in there. I'm about to cum too. Natsume: Ahhh! Ahh! Ahh! I'm gonna cum again! Kousei: Me too. This time, I'm gonna show you how I cum. Natsume: Show me... show me! I want to see you cum! Natsume: *pant* *pant*... Me too... I'm cumming again! Kiss me... kiss me! Kousei: *smooch* *kiss* *kiss* *smack*... *kiss* *smack*... Natsume: Nhhh! Ahh... *pant* *pant*... Ahmph, *kiss* *smooch* *slurp*! Kousei: Nhh, ahh... I'm cumming... Take it all! Natsume: I'll take it, I'll take it... So do it, inside--*kiss* *smack* *smack* *smooch*... Nhh, nghh! Kousei: Kh... ahh! I'm cumming, Natsume! Natsume: *smooch* *smooch* Nh, nhh, nhh, ngghhhh! Natsume: Nggggghhhhhhhhh! Natsume: Nh, nhh! Do it... I'm gonna cum again too! *kiss* *kiss* *smooch* *smooch*... Nhh, mhhhh! Kousei: Natsume! Natsume: *kiss* *kiss* *smack* *slurp* *smooch*... Nhhh, nh, ngghhhh! Natsume: Nggghhhhhhh! Kousei: Ngh, ahh... Natsume: *pant* *pant*... *pant*... I can hardly move... Kousei: Me too. Feels like I ejaculated every last bit of energy I had just now. Kousei: Just goes to show how turned on I was. And how much I love you. Natsume: Hey... I want another kiss... Kousei: Nhh... *kiss* *kiss*... *smooch*... Natsume: Mhh *smack*...

Kanna: You went somewhere together, didn't you? Mei: W-Well, yeah... Natsume: He didn't do anything stupid, did he? Kanna: We were worried that he'd get too carried away and blow his chance. Natsume: Yeah. He seems like the kind of guy to get way too worked up over a date. Mei: Wait, what? What? Suzune: Whoa there. Don't go having this conversation without me! Mei: Ah... Suzune-san. Good morning. Suzune: Good morning. So? You guys were talking about yesterday? Natsume: Yes. Suzune: How was it? How far did you two go? Mei: H-How far? Kanna: Jumping straight into it, are we? Suzune: I know you're just as curious as I am. I mean, they've basically seen each other naked now, no? Mei: WHAT?! Natsume: Wait, really? You've already done THAT? Mei: Oh, no! No, no, no! I mean--WHAT?! Suzune: Okay, maybe that was a bit misleading. I just meant they've seen each other in swimsuits. Mei: A bit?! That was EXTREMELY misleading! Kanna: Oh... so you went swimming? At a hot spring? Mei: We went swimming, yes, but at a pool... Natsume: Really? I didn't know they were already open at this time of year. Suzune: I think she means the big one nearby. It's a heated indoor swimming pool. Natsume: Oh, that sounds like a nice place to go to on a date. Mei: Actually, we went to the one by the station... Suzune: Wait, there's a pool by the station? When did they build that? Natsume: It must have a hot spring built in too. If it's by the station, I should go check it out myself sometime. Mei: Umm... No, it's not that sort of pool. It's a gym... Natsume: What? A gym? Mei: Yes. Like, a fitness center... Kanna: You went to a fitness center together? Mei: Yes... That is indeed where we went. Suzune: Oh. I thought for sure you went to a recreational pool to mess around and have fun. Mei: We just went to do some exercise. Separately... Kanna: Separately? Natsume: That... doesn't sound like much of a date. Suzune: More like a workout, than anything. Kanna: That's rather disappointing... Mei: Wh-What do you mean? It wasn't supposed to be a date! Suzune: Oh, come on. Don't be shy. Mei: I'm telling you, it wasn't a date! Suzune: Psh. That's lame. Mei: H-How? Natsume: A gym, huh? Well, I can certainly see that, coming from you. Mei: ...... Kanna: What's the matter? Mei: No, it's just... I feel a little dumb about the whole thing... Natsume: What for? Mei: The truth is, Senpai thought we were going to a recreational pool as well, but the idea hadn't crossed my mind at all... Suzune: Ahh. So Kousei was the only one who thought it was a date. Mei: N-No, I don't think that's the case... Mei: But still, he was absolutely right. We shouldn't have gone to a fitness center pool... Natsume: Oh, okay. So you wish you'd picked a better place for a date as well. Mei: F-For the last time, it wasn't a date! Kanna: Then allow me to be frank. How do you feel about him? Mei: Who? Kanna: Takamine-san, of course. Mei: Huh? Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What do you mean by that? Natsume: That reaction already says it all. Mei: N-No, I just, um... I have a lot of respect for him. Natsume: Respect? Mei: Y-Yes. Natsume: You... respect him? Kanna: Please don't look so bewildered. I feel bad for him now. Natsume: Sorry. Suzune: You respect him, nothing more? Mei: Huh? Well, um... I guess it's not only that... Mei: But... it's mostly respect... I think... Suzune: Hmm. Suzune: ...... Suzune: Nozomi-san's coming in today, isn't she? Kanna: Yes. Her shift starts at lunch. Suzune: Good. Are you all busy tonight? Natsume: Not particularly. Kanna: I don't have any plans either. Suzune: Well, if Nozomi-san's free as well, let's have a girls' night out! Suzune: Against the four of us, Mei-san doesn't stand a chance. Mei: Wait! What are you going to do to me?! Kanna: That's a great idea. Natsume: Sounds like fun. Mei: What? Huh? Why? Suzune: ...... Mei: Wh-What? Why are you grinning at me like that? Seriously, what? Suzune: Alright! Time to get to work, everybody! Kanna: Let's get down to it! Natsume: I'm looking forward to tonight. Mei: Wait, what? Hold up. Mei: Seriously? Kousei: See you guys later. Natsume: See you. Suzune: Where do you girls want to go? Should we find a restaurant somewhere? Kousei: Oh, are you all going out to eat? Kanna: We're having a girls' night out tonight. Nozomi: I can't wait. *giggle* Mei: ...... Kousei: Is it just me, or is Hiuchidani-san the only one not very excited about it? Natsume: Don't be silly. She's totally excited. Right? Mei: Yes. I am very excited. Kousei: Huh. Could've fooled me. Suzune: Actually, why don't we just go to my place? We'll have a hard time finding any places open this late. Natsume: True. We can just stop by a convenience store on the way and buy something there. Suzune: Alright. Let's get going. Suzune: Oh, and no boys allowed, so go kill some time before you follow us home, Kousei. Kousei: Huh? But if we're all going to the same apartment complex, why can't I just-- Suzune: No can do. Our girls' night out is already underway. Kousei: Fine. Suzune: Come on, girls. Let's go. Nozomi: Okaay. Mei: ...... Kousei: You alright, Hiuchidani-san? Mei: ...... Kousei: I'm gonna take that as a \"no.\" Suzune: Come on, Mei-san. Mei: Okay... Kousei: ...... Kousei: Weird. Suzune: Anyone want a beer? Natsume: I'm fine. Kanna: No, thank you. Suzune: Oh, well. More for me. Nozomi: Uh, so I forgot to ask, but why exactly are we having a girls' night out anyway? Suzune: So we can interrogate Mei-san about her relationship with Kousei. Nozomi: Her relationship with Kousei-kun? Mei: I wanna go home. Suzune: Aww, c'mon. We won't ask you anything too invasive. Just play along with us for tonight. Mei: *sigh*... What do you want to know? Kanna: In all honesty, how do you feel about Takamine-san? Mei: Cutting right to the chase, huh. I already answered that this morning, didn't I? Kanna: You said you respected him, but is that really all there is to it? Mei: I mean... Nozomi: Did something happen between them? Natsume: They went out somewhere together yesterday. Nozomi: Oh, phew. That's not bad... Suzune: What do you mean? Nozomi: I was afraid they'd gotten into a fight or something. Suzune: Oh, no. Just the opposite. They've actually been getting quite chummy lately. Nozomi: Oh, really? Natsume: How do you feel about all this, Sumizome-san? You're his childhood friend. Nozomi: He's never really been popular with girls, so honestly... I think it's great! It feels like my little Kousei-kun is finally growing up! Kanna: It almost sounds like you're talking about him as a brother. Nozomi: Well, we have known each other for a long time. That's just what happens. Kanna: There's your answer. Mei: What? Seriously, what? How do you want me to respond to that? Suzune: Let me be serious with you for a moment. Mei: Um, okay. Suzune: Whenever you have men and women working in the same place, it often presents a unique problem. Mei: Okay? Suzune: See, it's fine if they get along well, but if things turn sour, that can affect the atmosphere of the entire workplace, reducing productivity. Suzune: In order to avoid such things, it's therefore important for me to have a clear understanding of my coworkers' interpersonal relationships. Mei: Oh. I think I get that... Mei: ...... Mei: Did you really need to invite everyone else here for that, though? Suzune: Nope. Mei: What? Suzune: I just thought it'd be funner with more people. Mei: Seriously? Suzune: I won't deny that I'm doing this for amusement, but I also want to support you. Suzune: All you guys feel that way too, right? Natsume: Well, half that, and half out of curiosity. Kanna: I came 100\\% out of curiosity. Nozomi: In that case, I came 100\\% to support you! Suzune: See? Mei: Oh, uh... Thanks? Natsume: To be honest, like Suzune-san said, I want to know how things are going between you two as well--even though it's not really any of my business. Natsume: The cafe is just a really important place to me, so I'd hate for there to be any problems caused by interpersonal relationships. Natsume: Maybe I'm just a cynic, but I feel like it's all too easy for office romances to lead to those sorts of conflicts. Mei: Romance? Umm... I had a feeling that's where this was going, but, like... Natsume: Am I wrong? Mei: I don't think things between me and him are... like that. Kanna: You don't sound very confident. Mei: I mean, I don't have any experience with relationships, so I don't really know... Suzune: It definitely seems like you've got chemistry, though. From what I've seen, at least. Mei: Chemistry? Kanna: I agree. You become much more animated when you're talking with Takamine-san compared to when you talk with us. Mei: I-Is that true? I've never realized that myself... Natsume: I'd go so far as to say your eyes start to sparkle... maybe? Well, you get the idea. Suzune: You always go \"Senpai, Senpai!\" in such a cheerful voice. Whenever you're with Kousei, you seem even more upbeat than usual. Mei: What? Seriously? Natsume: What do you think, Sumizome-san? Have you noticed any recent changes in Takamine-kun's behavior? Nozomi: Hmm... I don't know. They definitely get along well, that's for sure. Nozomi: Ah--but I guess he seems a lot more... relaxed whenever he's around Mei-chan. Compared to Natsume-san and Kanna-san, for example. Natsume: True. He won't even sit beside me in class. Nozomi: Not a surprise. He's not really used to dealing with girls. Nozomi: But when he's with Mei-chan, I feel like he's more comfortable acting natural. Natsume: Hmm. I guess part of it might have to do with her being younger. Suzune: Not all the time, though. Yesterday he was all restless and fidgety. Mei: What? He was? Suzune: Yep. He was having a bit of trouble concentrating on work. Suzune: It made me smile, but he also kind of needed to get his act together. Suzune: So in all seriousness, the sooner you two sort out your feelings, the happier I'll be. Mei: Urk... Easier said than done... Kanna: It's almost Valentine's Day too. The timing couldn't be better. Nozomi: Oh, Valentine's Day! Are we doing anything special at the cafe? Natsume: Hopefully. Suzune-san and I are still figuring out what, though. Suzune: We'll probably do another limited-time special like we did on Christmas. I doubt it'll be as hectic this time around, though. Nozomi: True. People don't usually buy their Valentine's chocolates from cake shops. Suzune: If only chocolate had a longer shelf life. But yeah, that's why it's just going to be a limited-time thing, for girls to buy for their acquaintances and such. Suzune: You know, friend-chocolate. Kanna: Oh, that's right! I nearly forgot to ask. What should we do about OUR chocolates? Natsume: You mean for Takamine-kun? Kanna: Yes. And Mikado-san too. I wasn't sure if we should give our male coworkers chocolates. Nozomi: Why don't we give them one big gift, from all of us? That way it'll be easier for them to prepare a return gift too, as opposed to having to buy a gift for each of us individually. Natsume: Good idea. He'd probably be disappointed if we didn't get him anything. Suzune: In that case, Mei-san can get him something a little more personal. Mei: Gosh, why do we keep going here? Suzune: Well, it's either that or you pitch in with the rest of us. Which do you want? Mei: Well... I mean... Urk... Suzune: See? You don't want to, do you? Mei: Well, I mean... he does a lot for me, so, like... Mei: If I'm going to give him something... I want it to be from ME. Natsume: That's the only reason? Mei: Urk... Kanna: Oh? You're not denying it. Mei: I don't know what you want me to say... Mei: Ngh! Mei: I really don't know. I mean, I do l-like him, of course... Mei: But I just like him as a person... I don't know if that means I l-love him or not. Suzune: Ahhh! So adorbs! My heart can't take it! Natsume: God, what's gotten into you? Are you drunk? Suzune: A little. Kanna: Let me ask you this then. If Takamine-san started getting chummy with another girl, how would that make you feel? Mei: Hmm... Natsume: Out of all of us, I'd say he's closest to Sumizome-san, right? Nozomi: I guess, considering how long we've known each other. Suzune: Do you ever feel like there's a side of him only you know about? Nozomi: Something only I know? Let me think... Nozomi: His face when he wakes up, I guess? Kanna: You're not talking about what I think you are, are you? Nozomi: No, not like that. He gets up early by himself now, but I used to have to come over every morning to wake him up. Suzune: Ahh. I have a younger brother too, so I know what that's like. He'd always whine and yell when I yanked off his covers. Nozomi: Yeah... I once made the mistake of doing that too... Natsume: Why was it a mistake? Nozomi: You know how in the morning, guys get... um, you know... Suzune: Morning wood? Nozomi: Oh my god! You just outright said it! Mei: Morning what? Suzune: It's when guys get an uncontrollable erection in the morning. Mei: ...... Mei: Ahh! Suzune: Gee, what an adorable reaction. Nozomi-san, on the other hand, seems like she's pretty used to it. Nozomi: I wouldn't really say that. I've just happened to see it a few times, is all... Suzune: Oh-ho. So you've seen his erect ding-a-ling \"a few times,\" have you now? Natsume: His what? Kanna: She's definitely drunk, alright. Nozomi: I-It wasn't on purpose or anything, okay? It just happened on rare occasions when I came to wake him up... Suzune: Well, how does it feel knowing another woman's seen his, um... his wing-dang-doodle, Mei-san? Natsume: Excuse me? Kanna: You're a terrible drunk, Suzune-san. Suzune: Go ahead and tell us. Another woman's seen his private parts. How does that make you feel? Mei: Urk... Mei: Ngh... Mei: Nghhh! Mei: ...... Mei: It makes me feel... a little put out... I guess. Suzune: So you do have some feelings for him, deep down. Mei: Urk... I don't know... Suzune: Well, if you're planning to make him some homemade chocolate, let me know. I'll teach you everything you need to know. Mei: Homemade? But that'd totally make it seem like I... you know. Natsume: Like you're confessing to him, right. Mei: He might think I'm being too clingy, though... Nozomi: I don't know about that. I think he'd be thrilled. Suzune: So what do you say? Wanna make some homemade chocolate? Mei: Homemade chocolate... to confess my feelings... Homemade chocolate... Mei: Urk... Nghhhh! Mei: Ngh. Nozomi: M-Mei-chan? Natsume: She collapsed. Kanna: Her face is red as a beet too. Mei: I can't think straight anymore... My head's about to explode... Suzune: Aww, look at her. Acting all flustered like a young girl in love. Natsume: I feel like it's mostly your fault she's like this. Suzune: Sorry, she's just too cute. I can't help but tease her. Mei: Please, just let me go home already... I'm really not good with these sorts of conversations... Kanna: I know I said I only came because I was curious, but if you really are planning to confess to Takamine-san, I'll be glad to assist in any way I can. Kanna: I'd love for you two to be happily together. Nozomi: Me too! Let me know if there's anything I can do. Natsume: Alright. I think it's time we put this conversation to rest. It doesn't look like Hiuchidani-san can take much more. Mei: I can't... I'm about to die from embarrassment... Suzune: Man, what I wouldn't give to be young again... Kanna: What are you talking about? You're still plenty young. Suzune: There's a world of difference between being a student and being a working adult. Suzune: Time'll pass by before you know it, Mei-san. Make sure you don't leave any regrets behind. Mei: Urk... Alright. I'll try to think about how I really feel... Suzune: Honestly, though, it's already pretty clear to the rest of us. Kanna: That's just how love works. The person themselves can oftentimes be oblivious to the fact. Natsume: Very true. Nozomi: You three talk like you know a lot. You must have a ton of dating experience, huh? All Three: ...... Nozomi: Why did you all look away? Do you... not? Natsume: Anyway, why don't we start discussing our Valentine's Day menu? Suzune: Sounds like a great idea! Kanna: Indeed! Nozomi: Oops... I guess I shouldn't have asked. Mei: Urk... Mei: Do I really like him... that way? Mei: ...... Mei: Urk... I don't know! Ngh! Mei: G-Good morning! Kousei: What did you do to her yesterday? Suzune: Nothing. We just had a little chat. Kousei: ...... Suzune: Why are you giving me that look? Kousei: Because she's clearly acting weird. Suzune: Well, it's obvious why... Suzune: ...... Kousei: What do you mean? Suzune: Well, maybe I do owe her an apology. Kousei: What? Suzune: I might've teased her a little too much. Kousei: Huh? Suzune: Well, thankfully, we might see some progress now. Kousei: What progress? Suzune: You'll see soon enough. And you'd better thank me when it happens. Kousei: When what happens? Suzune: Uh-oh. Our orders are starting to pile up. Better get back to work. Kanna: Actually, Takamine-san, could I ask you and Mei-san to stay behind for a little while? Mei: Huh? Suzune: Hold on. What are you doing? Kanna: This doesn't have anything to do with what we discussed yesterday. I just need to talk to them about their shifts. Suzune: Oh, okay. Suzune: Well, see you all tomorrow! Natsume: Bye, everyone. Kanna: No, of course not. Kousei: I thought so. This is about Hiuchidani-san's eye, isn't it? Mikado: Yes, indeed. Mei: I forgot to ask before, but does anyone at the cafe else know about my eye? Mikado: Natsume knows. Suzune and Nozomi do not, however. Mei: Natsume-san san knows too? That's a relief. Kanna: Still, I must advise you not to speak with her about it too carelessly. We wouldn't want anyone overhearing you by accident. Mei: Alright. Mikado: How are things going with your eye? Mei: Nothing much has changed. Mikado: Which means you haven't found a way to release your butterflies yet? Mei: Err... No, not yet. Kanna: We haven't had many opportunities to practice, after all. Would you like to do some now? Mei: Sure. Mei: But that being said... Mikado: You said you are able to capture butterflies simply by staring at them, correct? Mei: Yeah. After I stare at them for a while, they just disappear. Kanna: In that case, perhaps you could do the opposite, and try staring at an empty space while imagining them appearing. Mei: Imagine them appearing? Mei: Nghhh... Mei: ...... Mei: It's not working. Kousei: What about other people who had the eye? How did they release their butterflies? Mikado: Well, if we knew that, we would not be having this problem. Kousei: Good point. But haven't any other Grim Reapers documented it? Kanna: We've tried searching for more information, but no such luck. Kanna: And to the best of my knowledge, Mei-san is the only person who possesses the eye yet can't see the butterflies. Kousei: So she's an anomaly? Mikado: We don't know that either. People who possess the eye are rare enough in and of themselves. There is simply not enough information. Mikado: That is precisely what makes her such an interesting case study. Kousei: You make her sound like some kind of guinea pig... Mei: That's okay. I want to find out everything I can about my eye as well. Mei: If anything, I should be the one apologizing for being so unhelpful... Kanna: If only I could use my scythe to retrieve the butterflies from your eye... Kousei: You can't? Kanna: I don't dare try. It could end up causing unforeseen damage to Mei-san's soul. Kanna: Perhaps if I knew exactly where the butterflies were located, I might be able to do something about it, but I don't. Mikado: We are no longer able to sense butterflies that have been captured by the eye. Mikado: That is why we did not realize that Mei possessed the eye in the first place. Kousei: Interesting. Kanna: I just had an idea, Mei-san. Mei: Yes? Kanna: Whenever you capture butterflies, is there anything in particular that you think of? Mei: Something I think of? Hmm... I'm not really sure... Kanna: So you do it without thinking? Mei: Well... I guess I think to myself, \"Go away!\" or something like that. Mei: But the very first time I ever noticed a wisp... Mei: ...... Mei: I was mostly just curious. \"What is that?\" I thought, and so I kept staring at it until it disappeared. Mei: That's what crossed my mind the first time it happened, at least. Kanna: Just curiosity... Kousei: So then if she does the opposite, and tries NOT to think about the butterflies, she'll be able to release them? Mikado: You realize that, until just recently, she had no idea that there were even butterflies inside her? Kousei: Oh, right. I guess she hasn't been thinking about them this whole time. I wonder what it is she needs then? Kanna: Maybe what she needs is... something more concrete. Mei: What do you mean? Kanna: If, by thinking about \"butterflies\", you are able to capture them... Kanna: Then perhaps by focusing your thoughts on a specific \"place\", you'll be able to release them. Mei: Oh. So instead of just vaguely trying to release them anywhere, I should try to think about releasing them towards someplace specific? Kanna: Why don't you give it a shot? Mei: Alrighty! Mei: Ngh... Mei: Nghh! Mei: C'mon, the chair... The chair! Mei: Nggghhhhh! Mikado: It doesn't seem to be working. Mei: I'm sorry... Kanna: Maybe you aren't focusing hard enough... or maybe I'm just completely wrong. Kanna: Hmm... Kanna: Your Excellency. Mikado: Yes? Kanna: Please turn into your cat form. Mikado: I beg your pardon? Kanna: Please turn into your cat form. Mikado: I refuse. Kanna: Please turn into your cat form. Mikado: You can repeat yourself however many times you wish, but no means no! Kanna: Please! I'm sure this will work! Remember that Mei-san has an abnormal fixation with cats. Mikado: I will not! Mei: A-Abnormal fixation? That's mean... Kousei: Well... she's not wrong. Mei: You too, Senpai?! Kousei: I mean... you turn pretty crazy whenever you see a cat. Kanna: To put it bluntly, you turn into a complete maniac. Mei: W-Wow! You're so mean! Kanna: We've got nothing to lose by trying. Please, Your Excellency! This is for Mei-san's sake! Mikado: Kgh... Very well. But you had best keep yourself under control this time, Mei. Mei: Don't worry! I will, I promise! Mikado: I do not believe you! Kanna: Please, Your Excellency. Hurry it up! Mikado: Fine... Have your wish! Mei: Ahhhhhhh! Mikado: Mei! Have you already forgotten your promise?! Mei: R-R-Relax! I-I'm fine! I-I'm completely calm! Kousei: That look in your eyes begs to differ... Kanna: This is just a guess... but Mei-san seems like the kind of person stray cats run from. Mei: How did you know? It's true; even cats that are used to people always run away from me! I wonder why? Mikado: Is it not painfully obvious? Kanna: Now then, Mei-san. Please try imagining your butterflies being released around His Excellency. Mei: R-Right! A-Around His Excellency! Y-Yes! O-Of course! Mikado: I do not wish to be rude, Mei, but I find your behavior most repulsive right now. Kousei: That's about as rude as it gets, though. Mei: I don't mind! He can call me repulsive as much as he wants! Kousei: You've got problems, Hiuchidani-san. Seriously. Mei: A-Anyway, here I go! Mikado: Very well. But you can do it standing from there. Do not come any closer, you hear? Mei: A-Alright! *pant*... *pant*... Mikado: ...... Mei: *pant*... *pant*! Mikado: Why are you breathing so heavily? Mei: *PANT*... *PANT*! Mikado: Enough! If this goes on any further, I will not be safe! Mei: *PAAAANT*! Kanna: Alright, Mei-san. Settle down, settle down. Mei: Huh? It's over? My time's up already? Wait! How much do I have to pay for an extension?! Mikado: What on earth is this child talking about? Kousei: Well, I guess that didn't work either. Kanna: My idea must've been wrong. I suppose we'll have to think this over some more. Mei: Five thousand yen! I'll pay five thousand yen! Mikado: That is quite enough. Playtime is over. Mei: Ahh... He's gone... Mikado: Good grief. I am beginning to suspect that this derangement of yours is a side effect of using your eye... Mei: What do you mean? I was totally calm and collected. Kousei: ...... Kanna: ...... Mikado: I believe you have something to say to me, Mei. Mei: Okay, fine! I'm sorry! Kanna: Anyway, why don't we stop here for today? Mikado: Before we do, though, I must ask. Have you captured any other butterflies lately besides the ones in the cafe? Mei: No. I haven't used my powers at all outside of the cafe. Mikado: Alright. Very well. Kanna: If that's all, then we'll see you-- Mei: Actually, can I ask one more thing? Mikado: Yes? Mei: Is it possible that using my eye... could have a negative effect on the person? Kanna: You mean when you use it to capture butterflies? Mei: Yeah. You said that it had the power to heal people's souls, but, um... how do I put this... Kousei: For example, if a person's soul was weakened because of a physical problem, healing their soul wouldn't resolve the underlying issue. Kousei: On the contrary, healing only their soul might have a negative effect on their body. Kousei: I think that's what Hiuchidani-san means to say. Mei: R-Right. That's it. Thank you. Mikado: Hmm... It is difficult to say for certain. Mei: In that case, isn't it kind of risky for me to be using my eye on our customers? Mikado: Perhaps. But it is also better than doing nothing. Mikado: There have been no instances of any customers returning to the cafe with new butterflies after you captured their old ones. Mikado: As of this moment, we have no reason to believe that the power of your eye has any negative effect on others. Mei: Oh... Kanna: Did something happen that caused you to think that it might? Mei: N-No, not exactly... Mei: ...... Mei: It's just... I feel like I've been getting a little carried away ever since I learned the truth about my eye, and learned that there were other people that understood me. Mei: If it turns out that my eye is causing others harm, though... I'd rather just stop using it altogether. Mikado: It is I who tasked you with capturing other people's butterflies. If there truly are any negative consequences of doing so, it would be my responsibility to bear. Mikado: So do not worry. Thanks to you, our job of collecting butterflies has been going remarkably smoothly. That is a fact. Mei: Okay. Thank you for saying that. Kanna: Are there any other questions you'd like to ask? Mei: No, that's all. Kanna: In that case, I'll see you both tomorrow. Good night. Mikado: Good night. Make sure you get plenty of rest. Mei: We will. Good night! Kousei: Good night. Kanna: ...... Mikado: Are you still worried? Kanna: I'm a little relieved, actually, knowing that Mei-san has her own reservations about using her eye. Mikado: I've never been worried about that myself. Despite appearances, she is a very rational-- Mikado: ...... Kanna: Struggling to finish that sentence, aren't you? Mikado: Allow me to rephrase. Although she tends to lose her head under certain circumstances, she is generally a very compassionate person. Mikado: She is the sort of person who would never even think about abusing the power of her eye. Kanna: I'm not worried about that either. I trust Mei-san completely. Kanna: What worries me is... something else. Mikado: We've already warned her many times not to let anyone realize the truth about her eye. Kanna: I know. Of course, times have changed now, but still... Mikado: People's hearts remain largely the same. Kanna: That's why I was against using her eye in the first place. Kanna: There may not be any problems right now, but if things start to fall apart, Mei-san will be the one to suffer. Kanna: And all the positive influence she's been having on Takamine-san's soul will be for naught. Kanna: If anything were to happen to Mei-san, Takamine-san would undoubtedly be greatly affected as well. Mikado: Hmm. So it is not Mei, but Takamine Kousei you are worried about? Kanna: I'm worried about them both. But... I realize I may just be feeling overprotective. Kanna: If you wish for her to have full control over the power of her eye, I won't object. Rest assured. Mikado: I understand that you are concerned, but we cannot allow these butterflies to simply remain inside of Mei either. Kanna: I know. Mikado: Incidentally, Kanna. Kanna: Yes? Mikado: What exactly was it that you and Mei spoke about yesterday? I understand you and the others had a \"girls' night out.\" Kanna: Tsk, tsk. How rude, Your Excellency. You mustn't ask a young lady to divulge her secrets. Mikado: Ah. So it was nothing of importance then. Kanna: Nihihi. Nope. Just a little gossip between girls, is all. Kanna: I do hope everything works out between those two, though... Mei: Oh... yeah. It's been weighing on my mind for a while now. Mei: The truth is, I've been getting a little carried away ever since His Excellency gave me this task. Mei: I'm worried that I've only been adding to people's troubles, like I did to her. Mei: I was starting to question whether capturing our customer's wisps was the right thing to do. Kousei: Hmm... It's hard to say. Mei: Yeah. It is. Kousei: But you know, I've been thinking as well. Kousei: I suggested that maybe this friend of yours had a physical problem, and that's why she still hasn't gotten better. Kousei: But after you'd cast your \"magic spell\" on her, you saw a significant improvement in her mood, didn't you? Mei: Yeah. While I wouldn't say she recovered completely, there was definitely a big improvement. Kousei: If that's true, then it must be some sort of emotional problem. That's why the power of your eye was able to cheer her up temporarily. Kousei: And in that case, there's no doubt in my mind that your \"magic spell\" provided her with some much-needed relief. Kousei: While it's unfortunate that she ended up becoming overly dependent on it, it's clear that the weight in your friend's heart was lightened because of you. Kousei: If I had to say whether it was the right or wrong decision, I'd have to say it was right. Kousei: So I don't think there's anything you should feel guilty or anxious about. Kousei: The power in your left eye is unmistakably a power that helps others. And I'm certain it'll help a lot more people from now on. Mei: ...... Kousei: Uh... sorry. Maybe it's not my place to say anything. Mei: N-No, don't apologize... Mei: ...... Mei: C-Can you read my mind, Senpai? Kousei: Huh? Mei: It makes me really happy... You always seem to know exactly what I want to hear. Mei: It almost feels like you know exactly what I'm thinking all the time. Kousei: Nah... I'm not that sensitive, to be honest. In fact, I can be downright insensitive sometimes. Kousei: But one thing I will say is that I'm not saying these things just to cheer you up. Kousei: I mean it. All of it. Kousei: The stuff about me being grateful to you, and the stuff about your eye--you, helping other people. Kousei: I mean all of it, from the bottom of my heart. Kousei: And if I managed to get that message across to you, well... then that'd make me happy too. Mei: ...... Kousei: Sorry if I seem like I'm trying too hard to be cool or something. I'm lame, I know. Mei: N-No! You're really not... Mei: ...... Mei: U-Umm! Kousei: Hm? Mei: Do you like sweets, Senpai? Kousei: Huh? What's this about? Mei: Do you? Kousei: Well, sure, I guess. Mei: Okay, great! Good night! Kousei: Huh? O-Oh. Yeah, g'night. Mei: Thanks for walking me home! See you tomorrow! Kousei: R-Right. See you tomorrow... Mei: ...... Mei: Hi, Suzune-san? It's me, Mei. I'm sorry for the random call... Mei: Um, I was wondering something... Mei: ...... Mei: C-Could you teach me how to make my own chocolate? "

            "Kanna: Yes. What can I get for you, ma'am? Housewife A: I'll have the chocolate cake. Housewife B: And I'll have the cheesecake, please. Kanna: Certainly. Housewife A: Oh, but the pancakes look wonderful too. Housewife B: I know! I was eyeing them myself, actually. Housewife A: What's the serving size like for the pancakes? Kanna: Well, a single plate is usually enough to fill up most of our female customers. Housewife B: Okay. Customer A: Excuse me! Kanna: I'll be with you in one moment! Housewife B: Ah! Why don't we split them? Housewife A: Hey, that's a great idea! Housewife A: In that case, we'll have one plate of pancakes along with those other two cakes, please. Also, can I get a house blend coffee as well? Housewife B: Make that two. Kanna: Certainly. Kanna: Thank you for your patience. Have you decided what you'd like to order? Customer B: I'll have a shortcake and a chocolate cake. Oh, and this fruit tart too. Natsume: When would you like your cakes? Customer B: Hmm. In about thirty minutes? Natsume: Understood. Please give a moment. Mikado: Thank you for your patience. Your total comes to 1,340 yen. Customer C: Thank you. Here's 2,000 yen. Mikado: Your change is 660 yen. Thank you for coming. We hope to see you again soon. Customer C: Thanks. Kanna: Mikado-san! I need two blend coffees and a Darjeeling. Also, an Assam tea as well. Mikado: Hmm. Drinks for four... Mikado: If I step away now, though, Natsume may not be able to handle everything on her own. Kanna: Yeah. Maybe we should focus on thinning out this line first. Kanna: Alright. I'll take care of the drinks, so you stay here and keep selling cakes. Mikado: Understood. Natsume: Welcome to Cafe Stella. How may I help you? Kanna: Still... it might take some time to do this all myself. Kanna: Order coming in! I need a plate of pancakes, an omelet rice, and a caprese-style pasta! Suzune: On it! Kanna: Also, I hate to ask--but would you mind helping me making a few drinks? Kanna: I'm afraid my hands are kind of full at the moment. Kousei: We're pretty busy in here too... Is that alright, though, Suzune-san? Suzune: Well, we can't just let her fend for herself. Fine. Go help her with the drinks, Kousei. But once you're done, I need you straight back here. Suzune: I'll try to do as much of the prep work as I can in the meantime. Kousei: Alright. Kanna: Thank you. And sorry for the trouble. Kanna: I'll handle the tea, Takamine-san. I need you to make two house blend coffees. Kousei: Got it. Kanna: I'll be right with you! Kousei: Let me handle this. Kanna: Thank you. Kousei: Thank you for your patience. Yuina: Hello! Kousei: Oh. Why, hello there, Yuina-chan. Yuina: One omelet rice, please! Yuina's Mother: I'm sorry. It looks like we've come during a particularly busy time. Kousei: Oh, that's fine. I'm glad to see you again. Kousei: Do you want your omelet rice thinly-fried like usual? Yuina: Yeah! Also, I want orange juice! Kousei: Of course. Yuina's Mother: As for me... Could I have a pancake and a Darjeeling tea? Kousei: Certainly. I'll have those out to you shortly. Kanna: Yuina-chan came to visit again, did she? Kousei: Yeah. I'd love it if they became regulars from now on. Kanna: By the looks of it, it seems like she already is. Kanna: I bet I can guess what she ordered. Kousei: Yeah. Omelet rice again. Kanna: I suppose that means you'll have to be the one to cook it. Kousei: That's the plan. Kanna: What about the coffee? Will it be ready soon? Kousei: Yeah. All that's left is to add hot water. Kanna: In that case, I'll handle the rest. I've just put on the tea cozies while I wait for the tea to steep. Kanna: Thanks for the help. Kousei: No problem. But you'll have to add two more drinks to the list; an orange juice and a Darjeeling for Yuina-chan and her mom. Kanna: Sure, I'll have those taken care of. Kousei: Sorry about that. I'm back. Suzune: I've finished prepping the pasta for you. You do the rest. Kousei: Got it. Also, we've got a new order. A thinly-fried omelet rice and a plate of pancakes. I'll handle the omelet rice. Suzune: Alright. Suzune: Hmm, guess I'll do the pancakes next. Those dirty dishes are kinda starting to pile up, though. I'd better clean them soon. Suzune: Man, weekend rush is no joke. It's tough without those other two around. Kousei: Well, they've got classes in the morning. Plus their mid-terms are coming up too, so they've gotta study. Suzune: Oh, right. I almost forgot. How're things looking on that front? Think they'll be able to pass? Kousei: From what I can see, they should be fine. Kousei: Or at least, Nozomi should be, since she's always been the studious type to begin with. Hiuchidani-san might have to do a bit of guesswork, though, so I'm not sure about her. Suzune: Gotcha. Kousei: Speaking of which--what were your grades like back when you were their age, Suzune-san? Suzune: I'd already decided to become a pastry chef by then, so I mostly got by with cramming last minute. Suzune: Order up! Pancakes for table two! Nozomi: Okay! Coming! Mei: I'll go relieve Natsume-senpai at the cake display out front. Suzune: Thanks, that'd be--wait, what? Kousei: What are you two doing here?! Aren't you supposed to be studying for your exams?! Nozomi: Don't worry. We're doing fine on that front. Kousei: But-- Nozomi: We both know how busy Saturdays get. I had to come or else I'd feel bad. Besides, look at how much there is to do today. Mei: Did you expect me to just sit by and study quietly in the break room? Hearing how hectic it was outside made it impossible to focus! Suzune: Well, I can get that. Suzune: Sometimes you take the day off, but you still can't stop thinking about work. Happens to me too. Mei: Exactly. Nozomi: That's why we want to get to work. Once things calm down, then we'll go back to studying. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Fine. I hate to say it, but we could use your help. Nozomi: Say no more! I'm taking out the pancakes for table two! Suzune: Come on, stop standing there. We've got work to do too! Kousei: Yes, ma'am! Kousei: Time's up! Nozomi: *siiigh*... Kousei: Alright. Now let's see how you did. Mei: Lay it on me. Mei: This is already the fourth time we've done this test. Nozomi: I can pretty much remember all the answers by now, but I think I'm starting to get WHY they're the right answers instead of just memorizing them--I think. Mei: Yeah. It's pretty crazy how much repetition helps. Kousei: Alright, I'm done grading them. Nozomi: That was quick! Kousei: Well, I've done it four times by now. Anyway, to the results. Kousei: Nozomi, your answers were essentially perfect, but you made a lot of careless mistakes. If it weren't for those, though, you might've gotten a perfect grade. Nozomi: I did try to be careful... but I guess I rushed a bit. Kousei: Also, keep in mind that you go to a different school. The questions on your exam are bound to be different accordingly, so watch out for that. Kousei: By the way, are you feeling alright? This would be a terrible time for you to get sick. Nozomi: Oh, I'm fine. I'm not feeling sick at all. Kousei: Good. Kousei: Now for you, Hiuchidani-san. It looks like you're thinking about question four the wrong way. Mei: Aw, geez. I knew my answer wasn't right. Mei: Thanks to you and Natsume-senpai. Kousei: Either way, I'm confident you aren't going to fail, at the very least. Mei: I sure hope so... Aw, man. Why can't the actual exams just be the same as these? Nozomi: I agree. That would be the easiest solution to all this. Kousei: I can't speak for Nozomi's, but that might be more likely than you think. Kousei: You have the same teacher as Shiki-san, so unless the curriculum's changed dramatically, his tests shouldn't have changed much either. Mei: I really, really hope you're right about that. Natsume: Okay, I'm headed this way. See you tomorrow. Mei: I'm going that way. Good night, guys. Suzune: Alrighty. Time to go home, hop in a hot bath, and crack open a cold one! Nozomi: Drinking alcohol while in the bath is supposed to be dangerous. Suzune: I know. I'll be careful. Nozomi: Huh? Why? Suzune: Well, it is getting pretty dark out. Suzune: I'll see you two tomorrow then. Night. Kousei: Good night. Nozomi: Good night... Nozomi: So, wanna tell me why you're randomly acting so overprotective? Kousei: I don't know; you just don't feel like your usual self. Kousei: You sure you're not working yourself too hard? Nozomi: Do I really seem that out of wack? Kousei: It's not really something visible, per se, like your facial complexion... I dunno. Chalk it up my intuition as your childhood friend, I guess. Kousei: Doesn't seem like you have a fever, at least. Kousei: Which leaves only one other thing... Have you been studying too hard? Nozomi: I mean, I don't THINK so. Kousei: You've been staying up later than usual to study, haven't you? Nozomi: Well, maybe a little. Kousei: Plus you've been working as a waitress too. It's no wonder you seem a bit out of sorts. Nozomi: I told you, I'm fine. Kousei: You call making that many careless mistakes on your test \"fine\"? Nozomi: Urk... Kousei: No more studying for today, alright? I want you to get some sleep. Nozomi: Come on. Kousei: It won't matter how much studying you do if you don't get enough rest. None of it will stick. Kousei: So go home, take a bath or something, and go to bed. Sleep is an important part of staying in top shape. Nozomi: Fine. I'll do what you want. Kousei: Good. Now let's get you home. Nozomi: Okay. Nozomi: Thanks for walking me home. See you tomorrow. Kousei: Yeah. Night. Nozomi: I'm hooome. Nozomi: Phew... Nozomi: Man, I am feeling kind of tired. Nozomi: I must've been accumulating all this fatigue without even noticing it... Not that I haven't been getting ANY sleep... Nozomi: Oh, well. I guess I'll be a good girl and listen to Kousei-kun for once. Time for a bath, then it's straight to bed. Nozomi: Nhh... *snore*... *snore*... Nozomi's Mother: Nozomi! Are you going to sleep in all day? Nozomi: Nh? Mhh? Nozomi's Mother: It's almost nine o'clock, you know! Nozomi: Wuh? Nozomi: Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa--?! Nozomi's Mother: Finally up, are you? What do you want for breakfast? Nozomi: I don't have time for that! Nozomi's Mother: You should at least eat SOMETHING. Nozomi's Mother: You have to get dressed anyway, don't you? I'll make you something in the meantime. Nozomi: Why didn't you wake me up earlier?! Nozomi's Mother: I tried! Don't blame this on me, young lady. Nozomi: I went to sleep so early yesterday! How'd this HAPPEN?! Suzune: I was thinking of going with a Yule Log for our Christmas cake. Kousei: Nice. A classic. Suzune: I don't know how many orders we can expect, so I thought we'd just test the waters this time around. Suzune: Fortunately, it looks like our regular cakes are still going well, so I thought it'd be best to play it safe this year. Suzune: We'll begin taking advance orders starting tomorrow, and go all the way up until Christmas Eve. Kousei: We should probably take a picture of the actual cake before that, though. Otherwise we won't garner much attention. Suzune: I know. I already took some pictures as I was baking the prototype, so we're all good to go. Kousei: Oh. All the better. Kousei: Now we just need to update our social media, start taking orders--Oh, and make some flyers to post around the cafe. Kanna: A Yule Log sounds like a fine idea. Mikado: If it won't interfere with your work, then I have no objections. Natsume: Me neither. I'm just worried that we'll have to set a limit on the number of orders, but I guess we'll have to wait and see. Natsume: Though I highly doubt we'll be flooded with hundreds of orders per day. Kousei: Hopefully not. But yeah, we'll have to wait and see before we can say for sure. Mikado: It seems that we'll need all hands on deck for both Christmas Eve and Christmas Day... Mikado: But aside from Kanna--Natsume, Nozomi, and Mei are all young maidens, so I would hardly be surprised if they had one or two dates already planned on those days. Natsume: You're doing that on purpose, aren't you? Natsume: Of course I don't have any plans. For one thing, I'm busy with work almost every day. Kousei: Nozomi doesn't have a boyfriend either. Kousei: Hiuchidani-san also doesn't... to my knowledge, but we should ask just to make sure. Kanna: Wait a minute. Why'd you exclude me from that list? Isn't that a little rude? Mikado: As far as I am aware, you have no boyfriend either. Kanna: That's not what I'm talking about! You totally excluded me from the \"young maiden\" category! Mikado: How long have you and I been together now? Kanna: Well, sure, I have been working alongside you as a Grim Reaper for many years now... Kanna: And in all that time, I've never been in a relationship, shared a kiss, let alone had sex. Kanna: Both my mind and my body are pure as virgin snow! If that doesn't make me a maiden, then what does?! Mikado: The fact that you can say all of that without even a hint of shame only proves my point. Mikado: If you wish to call yourself a maiden, then have some more modesty. Kanna: I am modest! You're making me sound like some sort of pervert... Nozomi: Um, good morning. Kanna: Good morning. Natsume: Good morning. Mikado: Good morning. Kousei: Hey, Nozomi. You're a bit late today. Nozomi: Sorry. I overslept a bit... Ehehe. Natsume: Did you stay up late again? Nozomi: Actually, as a matter of fact, I went to bed earlier than usual yesterday... Kousei: What'd I tell you? That just means you had a lot of fatigue built up. Nozomi: Urk... I can't argue with that. Kanna: You have been pretty busy these days. Natsume: Your mid-terms start tomorrow, don't they? Maybe you should take the day off today to rest up. Nozomi: Thanks, but I'll be A-OK. Nozomi: I got more than enough rest last night. I'm back in tip-top shape. Natsume: Well, if you say so. Nozomi: I'm gonna go get changed now. Kousei: ...... "

            "Suzune: Crud. Looks like I'm all out of beer. Mei: Would you like some tea? I haven't drunk directly out of this one yet. Suzune: Sure. By the way, these kelp rolls are delicious. Mei: Hehe. I'll be sure to let my grandma know. Have as many as you want! Suzune: Hey, Kousei! Is it ready yet? I'm already getting full from all these kelp rolls! Kousei: Sorry for the wait. I just finished now. Mei: But you added some kind of smoked ingredient, didn't you? Kousei: You'll see. Go ahead and try it. Suzune: Uh-huh. Mei: ...... Suzune: ...... Mei: Oh? Suzune: Something tastes different. It's a lot more fragrant when I bite into it. Mei: It can't be the bacon, right? Where's this smoky flavor coming from? Suzune: It doesn't seem to be the vegetables, either... What exactly did you do? Kousei: It's the black pepper. That's what I smoked. Mei: Ohh! It's the seasoning! Kousei: Yeah. In a way, black pepper is actually the main ingredient in carbonara. That's where the name of the dish comes from, in fact. Suzune: It's derived from the Italian word for charcoal burner, right? Because there's supposed to be so much pepper on it that it turns black. Kousei: Exactly. I was contemplating whether or not to smoke the salt, but I thought that would change the flavor too much. Kousei: So I decided to smoke the pepper instead. This way it adds a nice kick without destroying the balance of the dish. Suzune: You're right. It really does add a nice kick. It's amazing how a small addition can make such a big difference. Suzune: Even though the seasoning is fundamentally the same, the flavor has a lot more depth. Mei: This is amazing! Just like authentic carbonara! Not that I know what authentic carbonara tastes like, but still! Kousei: Glad you like it. I only just finished smoking the pepper, so the smell might be a little harsh-- Kousei: But as long as I let it sit for a while, it should disappear. Then all I need to do is mix it with some regular black pepper to fine tune the flavor. Suzune: Sounds good. It could use a bit of adjusting, but I definitely think this is good enough to serve to our customers. In all honesty, this really is delicious. Kousei: Thanks. What about you-- Mei: Phew! That was good! Kousei: Wow. Not even a crumb left. Mei: It was too good! Just like real Italian cuisine! Not that I know what real Italian cuisine tastes like, but still! Suzune: You already said that earlier. I get what you're trying to say, though. Kousei: Ahaha... I wasn't expecting this much of a reaction. I'm flattered. Mei: Seriously, it was delicious! You're a genius, Senpai! Kousei: O-Oh stop it... Suzune: Well, since Mei-san is showering you in praise, I'm going to be a little more critical. Suzune: Like you said before, the dish still needs some balancing. Kousei: I know. It's got a pretty strong flavor, so I'm gonna try letting it mellow overnight next time. Suzune: Instead of trying to figure out everything on your own, though, you should ask the others at the cafe to taste-test your dish first. Suzune: Then you can decide if you want to tone it down, or if you actually want to emphasize that distinct flavor. Mei: Ohh, I see! The more unique it tastes, the more likely it is to grab people's interest! Suzune: Exactly. But you might get differing opinions on which one is better, which'll make it harder to decide. Suzune: Still, it's up to you. At the very least, I don't think anyone's going to object to you adding this dish to our menu. Kousei: Alright. I'll give it a shot. Kousei: And thanks, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Huh? Kousei: I wouldn't have come up with this idea without you, so thanks. Mei: Please! All I did was suggest the first thing that came to mind. Mei: Don't underestimate your own genius, Senpai! This really is amazing! Kousei: Th-Thanks. Suzune: Ahem. Kousei: Wh-What? Suzune: We're all out of cheese and sausages, so I'm gonna need you to make me some more. Kousei: You already ate them all? I wanted some too, you know. Suzune: Oh, stop griping. C'mon! Kousei: Alright, alright. Fine. Mei: Senpai! I want to try smoking some other things too! Kousei: Sure. I'll rummage around my fridge and see what else we can toss in the smoker. Mei: This is gonna be great! Kanna: Here's to another great year! Let's all do our best! Suzune: Alrighty. Ready to get back to work? Kousei: Yes, ma'am. Kousei: Not so much changed as added a new twist. I tried smoking the pepper first. Natsume: I can't say it looks or smells particularly different, though... Kousei: You'll see once you try it. Nozomi: Well, I'm gonna go ahead and dig in! Nozomi: That faint hint of smokiness... It's amazing how much difference it makes. Natsume: You said you smoked it yourself? Kousei: Yep. It was all Hiuchidani-san's idea. Mei: Don't be silly. You came up with the idea to smoke the black pepper. Mei: All I did was suggest that we try to make our own bacon. Natsume: Ah. So you spent the break thinking up ways to improve our menu... Natsume: That's very commendable of you. I'm impressed. Kousei: Thanks. How do you think it tastes? Kanna: I, for one, think it's delicious. It gives the dish a lot more added depth. Nozomi: I think so too. This seems like it'd be a real crowd-pleaser. Natsume: It certainly is delicious, but... Kousei: But? Natsume: I feel like the pepper's unique smokiness has a sort of... mature taste to it. Natsume: It's definitely not bad by any means, but--and this is just my personal opinion... Natsume: But I think I actually prefer the regular carbonara. Natsume: So while I'm all for adding this to our menu, I don't think it should replace the original version. Nozomi: You said you added the smoked black pepper to the pasta at the end, right? Kousei: Yeah, I did. Nozomi: In that case, why don't we just serve our regular carbonara with a shaker of smoked black pepper on the side? Nozomi: That way, customers can add as much or as little as they want. Natsume: How would we know how much to prepare in advance, though? Some customers might use a lot more than others. Suzune: A lot of beef bowl restaurants used to do the same thing with their special shichimi spices, but they had to stop the practice a little while back. Suzune: Some customers were using unbelievable amounts of spice, which ended up hurting their profits. Nozomi: Oh... I guess that won't work then. Kanna: It seems like our safest option would be to add this smoked pepper version as a separate item on the menu. Kousei: Alright. So I have all the judges' approval? Kanna: Absolutely. I think this would make a fine addition to our menu. Nozomi: Me too. Natsume: Me three. Kanna: What do you think, Mikado-san? Mikado: I believe Natsume mentioned earlier that this dish had a rather mature taste. However, many of our customers also come here specifically for our coffee and tea. Mikado: Judging from what I have gathered, this would suit their preferences well. Mikado: Therefore, I am in agreement. Kousei: Thank goodness... Mei: Way to go, Senpai! Kousei: Thanks! Kousei: I was just gonna do it at home, actually... Mikado: Among other problems, that would be quite expensive. I would not recommend you do that. Kousei: I guess that's true. Mikado: I do have some other ideas you may wish to consider. Are you free to talk after this? Kousei: Sure. I've got time. Kanna: In that case, let's call it a day here. See you tomorrow, everyone. Natsume: See you tomorrow. Nozomi: See you tomorrow! Kousei: Phew... Kousei: Huh? Hiuchidani-san? Mei: Hey. Kousei: What are you still doing here? Mei: I was waiting for you to finish. Kousei: You could've waited inside. Mei: Ahaha. I didn't want to bother you guys. Mei: Anyway, I know I should've said something earlier... but would you mind walking me home? Kousei: Sure. I don't mind. Let's go. Mei: Thanks! Mei: Congratulations on getting your new recipe approved, by the way. Kousei: Well, you helped with that. Mei: Not at all. You did this on your own, Senpai. Kousei: Nah, it's all thanks to you. I would've never come up with this idea on my own. Kousei: Seriously, thank you. I'm really grateful. Kousei: This might sound kind of melodramatic... but I think I've gained a little more confidence in myself now. Mei: Ehehe... You're gonna make me blush. I don't mean to sound melodramatic either, but, like... Mei: You've done a lot for me as well, Senpai. Ever since you've helped me open up about my left eye, I feel like a huge weight's been lifted off my shoulders. Mei: That's why I wanted to be able to return the favor if I could. Mei: I'm glad I managed to be of some small help to you. Kousei: It wasn't small at all. You were a big help. Kousei: I was hoping to do something like this before I had to deal with my exams, so I'm glad it all went so well. Mei: Oh, your exams are coming up? Kousei: At the end of the month, yeah. Mei: Does that mean you're gonna be working fewer hours? Kousei: No, I'll be working the same as usual. I'll do fine as long as I pay attention in class. Kousei: And I can always study after work too. Mei: You're a pretty diligent student, aren't you? Kousei: I don't know about that... I'm just the sort of guy who hates procrastinating. Mei: That's what it means to be diligent, Senpai. I think that's something to be proud of. Kousei: Nah, trust me... I can be pretty lazy when I want. Mei: But in front of me, at least, you're always hardworking and dependable. Kousei: Okay, sheesh. Stop flattering me. It's gonna go to my head. Mei: Ahaha! Alright. Mei: Well, good night, Senpai. Kousei: Good night. And sorry you had to wait for me earlier. Mei: That's okay. I waited because I wanted to congratulate you. Mei: Anyway, see you tomorrow! Kousei: Yeah. See you tomorrow. Mei: ...... Mei: Hmm... Exams... "

            "Kousei: Hiuchidani-san? Hey. Kousei: Just finished doing some shopping, I take it? Mei: Yep. My parents asked me to run a few errands. Mei: Are you out to do some shopping too, Senpai? Kousei: Err, not quite... Kousei: I was just wandering around, looking for somewhere to eat. Mei: I don't blame you for wanting to take a break from cooking for once. It is New Year's Eve. Kousei: Yeah. Too bad most restaurants are closed, though. Kousei: But those bags look pretty heavy. Do you need a hand? Mei: Oh, no. I'm fine. My house isn't too far from here. Mei: What about you, Senpai? Aren't you planning to visit your family too? Kousei: The only family I've really got is my dad, and he's overseas. Kousei: Ah?! Mei: I heard she had to go back home because of some family matters, and apparently, she doesn't know when she'll be back. Kousei: Where'd you hear that? Mei: Mikado-san told me. Kousei: Oh. Mei: H-Huh? What is it? Was there some kind of serious accident or something? Kousei: No, nothing like that... but whatever it was, it was pretty sudden. Mei: Yeah. I hope she comes back soon. Kousei: Yeah... me too. Mei: She still hadn't finished teaching me how to brew coffee. Kousei: Coffee? Mei: For a while now, her coffee has been getting quite a reputation for its flavor, you see. Kousei: Oh. Now that you mention it... Mei: I can make a cup of coffee the way I learned before... but there's just something missing when I do it. Mei: Maybe it's just because I don't like bitter drinks. But that's why I've been practicing with Kanna-san's advice. Kousei: I can't wait. Mei: Anyway, I'd better get going. Have a happy new year, Senpai! Kousei: You too. Kousei: ...... Natsume: Ah. Kousei: Shiki-san. Out shopping? Natsume: Yeah... I'd ask how you're doing, but I think I already know the answer to that. Kousei: I guess that means you already know what happened to Kanna? Natsume: His Excellency told me that she'd gone on to be reincarnated. Kousei: Yeah. Natsume: What's on your mind, Takamine-kun? Kousei: Hmm. Kousei: I was just thinking about what kind of coffee beans to buy. Natsume: Coffee, huh? Natsume: I still can't say I understand the appeal. Any way you look at it, no one needs bitter coffee. Kousei: You don't like bell peppers either, do you? Natsume: Oh, shut up. Kousei: Out of curiosity, what kind of coffee beans do you think I should buy, Shiki-san? Natsume: Why are you asking me? I can't drink coffee unless I add enough milk and sugar to drown out the flavor. Kousei: I dunno. That's just the way the conversation was going. Natsume: What's the best-tasting coffee bean you've had up until now? Kousei: Hmm... Blue Mountain, I guess. Natsume: Oh, the really expensive one. Kousei: There's really nothing else like it. Kousei: You know what? It might be expensive, but it doesn't hurt to indulge every once in a while. Natsume: Maybe I should splurge a little and buy myself some expensive tea leaves too. Landlady: Oh, my! If it isn't Natsume-chan. Natsume: Oh! Hello, ma'am. Landlady: It's nice to see you. Oh, my. On a date, are you? Is this your boyfriend? Natsume: Absolutely not. Landlady: No? Ah, wait a moment. I remember you... Kousei: Hello. I work at Cafe Stella too. Shiki-san and I are coworkers. Landlady: Ah, of course. You're the one who works in the kitchen. Kousei: Thank you for your continued patronage. Landlady: It's my pleasure. Thank you for always making such delicious food. Kousei: My pleasure. Landlady: Not that we ever had customers lining up outside our door back then. *giggle* Landlady: I'm sorry I didn't have more faith in you from the start. Natsume: Don't be. It's only because you were reluctant to rent out the cafe to us that we all tried our hardest to change your mind. Natsume: If you'd rented it out to us without a second thought, I don't think we'd be nearly as popular with customers as we are now. Landlady: That's very kind of you to say. Landlady: But your food truly is delicious. Not only do you serve a wonderful cup of tea, but lately, I get the feeling the taste of your coffee has improved even more. Landlady: I'll be visiting you all next year as well. Natsume: Of course. We'll be waiting for you. Landlady: Well then, I'd best be going. I'd hate to interrupt your date any longer. Natsume: I told you we're not dating. Landlady: *giggle* Have a happy new year, you two. Natsume & Kousei: You too. Kousei: ...... Kousei: The landlady might be rather let down next year... when she realizes Kanna isn't here anymore. Kousei: You're right. If the cafe were to go out of business the minute she left, I'd never be able to face her again. Kousei: Besides, I've got to keep my promise to her. Natsume: What promise? Kousei: I promised her I'd keep on smiling. Natsume: Ah. Kousei: It's a pretty hard promise to keep... but we can't just let these butterflies roam free, can we? Kousei: Anyway, you don't have to worry about me, Shiki-san. Natsume: Alright. Still, if you ever need my help, just let me know. Kousei: Thanks. I will. Nozomi: Hm? Ah, Kousei-kun! Kousei: Oh? Didn't expect to see you here too, Suzune-san. Suzune: 'Sup. Kousei: What are you doing here? Suzune: I came to offer the gods a quick prayer before going back to my parents' house. Then I bumped into Nozomi-san here. Nozomi: What about you, Kousei-kun? What are you doing here? Kousei: It'd be a pain in the ass to visit the shrine later on if I want to spend my New Year's chilling, so I thought I'd drop by now since I was already out. Kousei: Is it weird, visiting in the middle of the day on New Year's Eve? Nozomi: Not at all. New Year's Eve is when we give thanks for the previous year. And the new year is when we pray for the year to come. That's all that matters. Kousei: I see. Nozomi: Oh, but don't forget to toss some cash into the offering box. Kousei: Trying to guilt me into making a donation, huh? That's not very shrine maiden-like. Nozomi: Well, I'm only a part-time shrine maiden. Ehehe. Nozomi: If you want, you're welcome to try on my outfit too, Suzune-san. Suzune: No, thanks. I'm not falling for that one. I've already decided I'm not working on New Year's. Nozomi: Aww. Well, it was worth a shot... Suzune: The holidays are all about lazing around under the kotatsu for me. Kousei: I'd have to agree. Nozomi: I don't think you should be lazing around too much, though, Kousei-kun. Kousei: Come on, it's New Year's. Besides, I've been getting up so early for work lately. It's not like I'm leading an unhealthy lifestyle. Nozomi: I know, but you've got a girlfriend now. Kousei: Kanna isn't... Nozomi: Oh, wait. She had to go home because of some family matters, didn't she? Suzune: Oh, that's right... Guess that means you're going to be by yourself for New Year's. Kousei: Yeah, probably. Suzune: That's a shame. On New Year's, of all days. Kousei: Well, it is what it is. Kousei: It would've been too selfish of me to ask her to stay. Nozomi: Well, I hope she comes back soon. Nozomi: We should totally have a New Year's party when she does! Kousei: A New Year's party? Nozomi: Yeah, like that time we all had yakiniku together! That was really fun. Kousei: Yeah. It really was. Kousei: It sure would be nice to do that again... if everyone had the time. Kousei: But even I don't know when Kanna will be back, so... Suzune: Hmm... Maybe we could all go cherry-blossom viewing? That's still a ways off, though. Nozomi: Oh, that's a great idea! Kousei: We can just have a New Year's party with those who can make it, though. Nozomi: Don't be silly. Parties are meant to be celebrated with everyone. Suzune: Yeah. What she said. Nozomi: You too! Happy New Year! Kousei: Happy New Year. Kousei: I don't want to keep you for too long either, so I'll just say my prayers then go home. Nozomi: You'd better be eating properly, you hear? If you feel too lazy to cook, I can bring you some osechi later. Kousei: Nah, that's okay. You don't need to do that. Kousei: You're gonna have your hands full helping out at the shrine for the next few days, aren't you? If I really have nothing to eat, I'll give you a call and come over instead. Nozomi: Well, alright. Kousei: You sure have it tough, though. Kousei: Normally you have to work part-time at the cafe, and now you have to help out at the shrine for New Year's. Nozomi: That's just how it is. I've accepted it as my fate for being born a Shinto priest's daughter. Still, it's not like I don't want to help at all. Nozomi: And besides, working at the cafe is fun. I doesn't feel much like a job to me. Kousei: You're always a huge help to everyone, Nozomi. In a lot of ways. Kousei: Thanks for everything you do. Nozomi: Someone's awfully honest today... You didn't eat some weird garbage off the ground, did you? Kousei: Well, it's New Year's Eve. Kousei: You're pretty much like a guardian deity to me, so I'm expressing my gratitude to you for the past year. Thank you. Nozomi: You're free to thank me any other day of the year as well, you know. Kousei: C'mon. I'm trying to be sincere here. Nozomi: Well, your delivery needs some work. Nozomi: I appreciate your gratitude, but you don't need to make up some weird excuse to say thank you. I'm sure you'd make Mom and Dad happier that way too. Kousei: Yeah, you're right. I'll stop by and say hello to them before I leave. "

            "Natsume: Hey. Mei: How's Kousei-senpai doing? Kanna: He seemed fine. He had a decent appetite, and his temperature was normal too. Suzune: Phew. That's good to hear. Kanna: Thank you for lending me your key, Nozomi-san. Nozomi: You're welcome. I was feeling pretty worried myself; Kousei-kun rarely gets so sick that he has to stay at home. Mei: Really? Nozomi: He always seems relatively healthy, doesn't he? Nozomi: As far back as I can remember, he's never come down with anything worse than a light cold. His immune system must be pretty strong. Suzune: Hmm. So I guess even people like him aren't invincible? Kanna: It is winter, after all. Perhaps he let his guard down a little too much. Kanna: But I'm sure he'll be fit as a fiddle by tomorrow. Mikado: Well then, now that our worries have been laid to rest, let us get back to cleaning up. Nozomi & Mei: Okaay. Mikado: So. Mikado: How was Takamine Kousei truly doing? Kanna: As we feared, his soul had weakened considerably. Mikado: I assume you treated him accordingly? Kanna: Yes, of course. In order to return his weakened soul to normal, I poured my energy into-- Kanna: I mean, that is to say... Kanna: ...... Kanna: I did what had to be done. Mikado: That is quite the vague way of putting it. Kanna: Pay me no mind. Mikado: ...... Mikado: Come to think of it, I believe that you have to physically touch someone in order to transfer your energy to them. Kanna: Yes... that you do. Mikado: And furthermore, it cannot be a simple holding of the hands. It has to be a more intimate method of contact, if I recall. Kanna: ...... Mikado: Did you have sexual intercourse with him, by chance? Kanna: Of course not! Where on earth did that come from?! Mikado: You were acting quite odd, so I thought perhaps that was why... Kanna: Excuse you? What, did you think that instead of pouring my energy into him, he poured his essence into ME?! Kanna: You're so vulgar, Mikado-san. Mikado: That is simply your own filthy mind clouding your judgment, you nymphomanic excuse of a Grim Reaper. Kanna: Please never call me that ever again. Mikado: Still, something happened, no? You have a terrible poker face when it comes to hiding your own secrets. Kanna: Nothing happened. I just... put my forehead against his. Mikado: Hmm. Nothing too strange, I suppose. Kanna: The idea seemed fine to me at first, since it's something a parent might do for their child... Kanna: But once I actually did it, I started feeling incredibly embarrassed for some reason... and my heart began pounding like crazy... Kanna: Then I started babbling nonsense, shouting sex this, sex that. Mikado: Now you have lost me. Kanna: (Maybe it's because I did something I've never experienced before. Something I wasn't used to...) Kanna: (Maybe that's why it makes my heart race just thinking back on it.) Kanna: (In fact... Ever since I met Takamine-san, I've been feeling my heart race quite often.) Kanna: (But it goes beyond just that.) Kanna: (We've also had lots of fun chatting about silly things, phone shopping, eating yakiniku with everyone, and taking lots of pictures.) Kanna: (Enjoyable memories that don't just make my heart race, but also bring a smile to my face.) Kanna: (When did I begin to actively want to do those things with others...) Kanna: (And whenever the thought crosses my mind--) Kanna: (I naturally picture Takamine-san there as well.) Mikado: ...... Kanna: Oh! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to get lost in thought. Mikado: In any case, is it safe to say that the matter with Takamine Kousei's weakened soul has been resolved? Kanna: Yes. I believe he should be up and about by tomorrow. Mikado: And what about you? Are you... Mikado: ...... Mikado: Never mind. Forget it. Mikado: At any rate, even assuming Takamine Kousei feels well enough to return to work tomorrow, I suggest you keep a close eye on him. Kanna: Tomorrow... Mikado: Is something the matter? Kanna: No, it's nothing. Kanna: (Is it... normal that I can't wait to see him back at work tomorrow?) Kousei: Hmm? Child: Forgive me... I'm sorry, I'm sorry... Kousei: What a weird dream, though. Kousei: Why are you whispering like you're filming a prank video? Nozomi: Huh? You're already awake, Kousei-kun? How are you feeling? Kousei: I feel fine. Great, even. Kousei: What are you doing here so early, though? Nozomi: I came to see how you were doing, duh. Kousei: I appreciate the concern, but I'm all better now. Couldn't be better, in fact. Nozomi: Are you planning to go to work today? Kousei: Yep. With the way I'm feeling, I shouldn't need to play it safe. Nozomi: Hmm... Let me see. Nozomi: I've got some breakfast prepared for you, so why don't we eat together? You are hungry, aren't you? Kousei: Absolutely. But if you're only gonna start cooking now, I might end up late for work. Nozomi: Worry not, Kousei-kun. It's just last night's leftovers. Nozomi: I was worried you might not have an appetite, so I packed everything into these Tupperware containers in case you needed to keep them in the fridge for a while. Kousei: Man, you're the perfect girl, Nozomi. Nozomi: Ehehe! Your praise is greatly appreciated. Nozomi: Oh, that reminds me. I'm sure everybody's worried about you, so let them know you're back on your feet, okay? Kousei: Good idea. Suzune: Mhh, tastes fine. Thanks. Kousei: Alright. I'll get to work on the next batch. Kanna: Good morning, you guys! Kousei: Ah! Suzune: Hey there, Kanna-san. Kousei: O-Oh, uh... hi, Akizuki-san. Kanna: Having naughty thoughts first thing in the morning again, are we? My goodness. Nihihi! Kanna: (Calm down, Kanna! Just calm down! Do not panic!) Kanna: (If Takamine-san sees me like this, he's going to get the wrong idea.) Kanna: (I'm a Grim Reaper. It would cause nothing but trouble if I were to lead him on like that... Alright.) Kanna: Ahem. Good morning, Takamine-san. Kousei: Yeah. Good morning. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Huh? O-Oh. Sorry. Kanna: Takamine-san... You weren't having any weird fantasies again, were you? Kousei: Hahaha. Don't be ridiculous. Kanna: You're acting awfully suspicious. Kousei: I mean, can you blame me after what we did yesterday? Kousei: Easier said than done... Kousei: The more you tell me not to worry about it, the harder it is to actually do. Kanna: I understand that, but still... Kousei: ...... Kanna: ...... Suzune: *stare* Kousei: Er... Could you please stop staring at us? Suzune: Stop making me out to be the bad guy here. Suzune: Something happen yesterday between you two? You mentioned feeling awkward. Suzune: Don't tell me that \"visit\" was just an excuse for you two to get it on or something? Kanna: We did nothing of the sort! I only went to check up on him! It was just a normal visit!  Kousei: What?! THAT was normal for you? It was my first time... *blush*... Kanna: Don't test me! Kousei: Sorry, sorry. Bad joke. Kousei: Anyway, it's not what you're thinking. All she did was cook me omelet rice. Kousei: But enough about that. Let's get back to work. We've gotta hurry or we won't make in time for opening. Suzune: Well, whatever. As long as it doesn't impact your work. Kanna: I'd better start getting the dining floor ready too. Kanna: By the way, Takamine-san. Would you come see me later when you have some time? There's something I'd like to check with you. Kousei: Alright, sure... Suzune: Hmm... I'm not sure you'll have the time. You need to get to class soon, don't you? Kousei: Oh, right. I didn't realize the time. Suzune: Go on. Get outta here before you're late. Kousei: Alright. Just let me finish up here before I leave. Kousei: Okay. Let's get going. Kanna: Takamine-san? Thank goodness I caught you before you left. Kousei: Are you taking a break? Or is there some kind of problem? Kanna: Did you forget what I told you this morning? I wanted to check something with you. Kousei: Oh, right... Sorry. I was so focused on work that I totally forgot. Kousei: You want to check on my soul, right? Kanna: Yes. I want make sure everything's okay, just to be safe. Kousei: So, uh... are we gonna do the forehead thing again? Kanna: Yes... we are. Otherwise I won't be able to tell. Kanna: But don't worry. I won't make a fool of myself like yesterday. I've calmed down a bit since last night, so I promise not to go shouting about sex and whatnot again. Kanna: I can't guarantee I won't get embarrassed, though... Kousei: Well, as long as you're fine with it, I don't mind. Kousei: In fact, this is my life and health we're talking about here. I should be begging you to do it. Kousei: Thanks. And sorry for making you deal with my problems all the time. Kanna: Oh, don't worry about that. It has always been my job to look after your well-being, after all... And besides, I'm rather enjoying myself. Kousei: You are? Kanna: Yeah. It's kind of like... all this time, I've done nothing except guiding the souls of the dead, performing my duties as a Grim Reaper. Kanna: Not to say I dislike my job as Grim Reaper, though. I think it's a very important responsibility. Kousei: Ah... I guess I understand where you're coming from. Kanna: Not to mention phone shopping, eating yakiniku, and taking pictures of everyday things. Kanna: But all of it has been incredibly fun. Kanna: So please, don't hesitate to let me know if you ever need something. It doesn't have to be anything Grim Reaper-related either. I'll be happy just to hear from you. Kousei: Alright. Kanna: O-Oh, goodness! I didn't mean to prattle on for so long! I'm not going to make you late for class, am I? Kousei: Nah, I'm fine. I've still got another ten minutes to spare. Kousei: ...... Kousei: I can't believe how sensitive I am. It's gross. Hiroto: What are you talking to yourself about? Hiroto: Is your head still not working right? Kousei: Hmm... You're not exactly wrong. Kousei: But I'm not sick like I was yesterday. Natsume: Really? Well, that's good. Hiroto: Ahh! G-God, you scared me. Kousei: Shiki-san? How long have you been standing there? Natsume: I just got here. I'm glad to hear you're feeling better. Kousei: Thanks. Natsume: What's wrong with you today, though? Kousei: I don't know if there's something wrong with me, per se... Kousei: Well... Hiroto: Then what? Spit it out already. Kousei: I think there's... a girl that I like. Natsume: Whoa, really? Who is it? You have to tell me. Hiroto: Didn't expect you of all people to be so curious about something like this, Shiki-san. Natsume: Oh, shoot. I'd like to hear more, but I'm going to be late for class... Natsume: Can we meet up again after class? I want to hear all the juicy details about this. Hiroto: Good idea. We should find a quieter place and time for this. Kousei: We've gotta get back to the cafe after class, though. Natsume: We can spare a little bit of time, surely. I'll call ahead to let the others know. Kousei: Yeah, sort of. Natsume: Oh-ho. Let me take a guess then... Is it Akizuki-san? Kousei: You knew? Natsume: Well, by process of elimination, it had to be her. Hiroto: Akizuki-san... Isn't she that girl you went phone shopping with? Hiroto: I mean, she is pretty attractive... I'm not surprised you have a crush on her. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Ahhhhhh! Hiroto: Why are you squirming around all of a sudden? Kousei: I dunno. But just thinking about her makes my heart race... Natsume: What are you, a teenage girl? Hiroto: I won't lie, you're acting kinda creepy. Kousei: It's not my fault. This is the first time I've ever felt this way... Natsume: Again, that's a textbook teenage-girl-in-love line. Hiroto: Stop blushing like that. It ain't cute. Kousei: Trust me, nobody's more surprised about this than I am. I never imagined I'd fall head over heels for someone like this, the way they do in manga. Kousei: This... must be what true love feels like. Hiroto: Kousei... Hiroto: Urgh! I can't believe you actually just said that! I'm gonna fucking die of cringe! Kousei: Shuddup! Natsume: Don't tease him. I know it sounds cringey, but his feelings are genuine. Natsume: I'm getting second-hand embarrassment just from listening to this too, but remember, his feelings are genuine. Kousei: You're teasing me just as much as he is. Hiroto: So? You gonna ask her out? Kousei: Nah, it's way too soon for that. Hiroto: But you should probably make some kinda move. Even Nonaka-kun's putting himself out there. Kousei: I mean, sure... but it could affect our work relationship from now on... Hiroto: Maybe, but if you let that stop you, you're never gonna get anywhere. Hiroto: If all you do is make excuses, your relationship's gonna stay the same forever. Kousei: I mean, I get that, but still... Natsume: Instead of confessing to her out of the blue, why don't you ask her out on a date first? Hiroto: Oh, yeah! You can go on a date for Christmas! Kousei: But we're selling our limited-edition Yule Logs on Christmas day. Kousei: Even now, I'm being forced to spend my free time practicing making them over and over until Suzune-san's satisfied. Kousei: I'll probably be spending the entire day on Christmas rolling those cakes into logs... I hope I don't get tendinitis. Natsume: Well, what about tomorrow then? The cafe's going to be closed, so you won't have to worry about work. Hiroto: Just ask her out, man. Kousei: H-Hrmm... Hiroto: Sheesh. Grow a pair, will you? Kousei: I mean, you can't just spring this on me all of a sudden... I don't even have time to come up with a plan. Natsume: You'll be fine; it's the holiday season. As long as you go someplace where you can see Christmas lights, it'll seem like a proper date. Hiroto: Still, it's better to decide these sorts of things sooner rather than later. Hiroto: For reference, what kind of Christmas date would you want to go on, as the girl here, Shiki-san? Natsume: I wouldn't want to go out. Too many people. Hiroto: So you'd prefer a stay-at-home date? Natsume: Honestly, just because it's Christmas doesn't mean you absolutely have to go on a date. Hiroto: Not a big fan of the holidays, are you? Natsume: If you ask me, guys are the ones who put too much importance on the holidays. Natsume: Dealing with huge crowds and long lines is nothing but stress. Hardly my idea of a fun date. Hiroto: I mean, yeah, but Christmas only comes once a year. Kousei: What do you suggest then, Hiroto? Hiroto: Me? Hmm... Oh, fine. Hiroto: I was actually going to use this myself... but I'll let you in on my special date plan. Kousei: Ohh! That'd be awesome! Hiroto: The key is to be romantic. And surprises are important too. Kousei: Right. Hiroto: And when it comes to Christmas dates--presents are an absolute must. Jewelry would be a good choice. Hiroto: But wait! I know what you're thinking. An ordinary gift like that isn't going to win any hearts. Hiroto: That's why it's critical to pick something that conveys your true feelings. Kousei: What kind of jewelry, specifically? Hiroto: Why, a necklace that spells out the word \"love,\" of course! Apparently, a ton of places even do custom-made orders these days! Hiroto: It's the ultimate heartfelt Christmas present that combines both romance and surprise! Genius, isn't it?! Natsume: You're a freak. Hiroto: What the hell was that for?! Natsume: If someone gave me a love necklace for Christmas, I'd be pretty turned off. Hiroto: Surely giving a girl such a unique and memorable gift would increase your chances of success when confessing to her, though. Natsume: Why would you ever think that? Natsume: Unless that girl is a rapper, or the famous samurai Naoe Kanetsugu, I doubt they'd want a necklace like that. Hiroto: That's not true! The most widely accepted theory is that Naoe Kanetsugu's armor was decorated with the character for \"love\" in tribute to the Buddhist deity of martial arts, not because-- Natsume: Nobody cares. Hiroto: F-Fine! Then how about city-gazing?! Like, at night! Hiroto: Walking around looking at Christmas lights isn't a bad idea either, but for a fashionable girl who doesn't wear sneakers, that might take a bit of a toll on her feet! Natsume: That's pretty considerate of you, actually. Hiroto: So here's what you do. You book a room at some high-class hotel, then as the two of you are gazing out at the city lights, you come up and hug her gently from behind. Natsume: Why would he book a hotel for them? They're not even dating. Hiroto: Finally, for the finishing blow, you whisper into her ear, \"Let's show this city what our love looks like.\" Natsume: God, I think I'm going to puke. Hiroto: It's foolproof! Whaddaya think?! Natsume: That's just plain disgusting! Are you completely incapable of coming up with any normal ideas? Hiroto: But he's gonna wanna show her that he's not like other guys! Natsume: Yes, in a GOOD way! Not by showing her that he's a disgusting creep! Natsume: Are you even listening to yourself? Cut it out before you make him do something he'll regret! Kousei: I think I'm starting to see why you're not very popular with girls. Hiroto: The hell'd you say?! Kousei: I doubt you even know how to ask a girl out period. Hiroto: Excuse you. I know perfectly well how. Hiroto: \"Hey, how's it goin'? So, listen. I know this is kinda random, but do you want to go eat somewhere with me? I know this great place. I was actually planning to go with my friends, but they canceled on me last minute.\" Hiroto: See? Piece of cake. Kousei: Let's turn to our commentator, Shiki Natsume, for a reaction. Natsume: That was atrocious. Hiroto: That was WAY too brutal! Natsume: I think you ought to reconsider your approach a little more. Hiroto: Urk. I've been told that before... Natsume: You don't need some lame excuse to ask a girl on a date. Just be upfront about what you want to do, and when you want to do it. Natsume: If you want to pull out this \"special plan\" of yours, at least save it for AFTER you've started dating... Not that it'd be any less gross then, but still. Hiroto: I'll keep that in mind. Natsume: That goes for you too, Takamine-kun. Don't try too hard. Just pick an activity you're comfortable with. Kousei: Hmm. Natsume: Maybe take her to a movie, or go window shopping. Just something ordinary. The important thing is to keep the mood enjoyable. Natsume: As long as you can do that, your relationship will naturally progress beyond being mere friends. Natsume: It won't be too late to do something special for her later on, if you feel like your relationship is starting to get into a rut. Hiroto & Kousei: Whoa... Hiroto: That's the Solitary Sniper for you. She's got way more experience with dating than we do, that's for sure. Natsume: ...... Hiroto: Oops. Sorry for calling you that. Natsume: It's okay. I know that's what people call me. But to be honest... Natsume: Despite everything I said, I don't actually have a lot of relationship experience... None at all, in fact. So take my advice with a grain of salt. Kousei: Still, I appreciate being able to get some sensible input from a real girl. Kousei: And thank you too, Hiroto. You've been a big help too. Hiroto: What, by being a bad example to learn from? Is that what you're trying to say? Kousei: No, I'm serious. Thanks for hearing me out. Kousei: If I had to deal with this myself, I might've done something really stupid. Natsume: Seriously? Kousei: My heart feels so warm. Kousei: It's been really hard to deal with lately. I can't seem to calm down whenever I look at Akizuki-san. Kousei: I want to talk with her about something--anything. I want to spend more time together with her. Natsume: You really are a teenage girl. Hiroto: He's down bad, that's for sure. Kousei: Anyway, my chest feels a bit lighter now. Thanks, you guys. Hiroto: If there's anything else you need, let me know anytime. Kousei: Just out of curiosity... What kind of Christmas present would you give a girl, Hiroto? Hiroto: I'd give her an engagement ring! No shit! An insanely expensive brand-name one! Combined with an intimate handwritten letter! Natsume: What did I just say about taking things slow?! Kousei: I can't let my nerves get to me. Kousei: Deep breaths, Kousei. Be natural. Be casual. Kousei: If I can manage that, I'll be fine. Yeah. Kousei: Hey, Suzune-san. I'm back from class. Suzune: Hey there. Kousei: Any orders I can work on? Suzune: I was just about to get started on these two plates of pancakes. Kousei: Let me handle them. You go ahead and take your break. Suzune: You sure? Well, okay. Give me a shout if you need anything. Kousei: Will do. Kousei: Now then. Kanna: Coming! Kousei: Ah! Kousei: Yeah, I'm back. Kousei: I'm feeling fine too, by the way. Suzune-san's on break right now, so I just finished up these pancakes for her. Kanna: That's great. Well, I'd better carry these out before they get cold. Kousei: Sure. Kousei: Before you go, though... Kousei: Er, never mind. Be careful not to trip and fall. Kanna: I won't do that. I'm not a child. Kousei: ...... Kousei: I shouldn't be asking her out while we're on the job. That'd be a distraction. Kousei: There's still time. I have plenty of chances to ask her out today! Kousei: And just like that, the day's over. Kousei: Guess I'll get changed. Kanna: Takamine-san? Do you have a minute? Kousei: Huh? Kanna: You seemed to be acting somewhat strange today. Are you alright? Kanna: Hmm... It doesn't seem as if there's anything wrong with your soul. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Well... that's because... Kousei: ...... Kanna: Tomorrow's our day off, isn't it? I don't have anything particular planned. Kousei: In that case, would you mind coming with me somewhere? There's someplace I want to go. Kanna: Where would that be? Kousei: I'll... have to tell you later. Kousei: But I want you to come with me. Kanna: Oh... okay then. I'll go with you. Kanna: Ah--is that why you were acting so funny the whole day? Kousei: I was trying to find the right moment to ask. Kanna: Oh, silly. You could've asked me that anytime. Kousei: I guess... I just didn't want to bother you while you were working and stuff, so... Kousei: A-Anyway, thank you. I'll see you tomorrow. Kanna: Right. I'm looking forward to it. Kousei: Great. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go outside...  Kanna: Huh? But you haven't finished changing yet. Kousei: Yeah, I know. I just need to step outside for a minute. Don't worry, I'll be right back. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Ngh... Kousei: Let's goooooooooo! I did it! Kousei: I was freaking out like crazy... Kousei: But... she said yes. Kanna: So that's the gist of it. You don't have any problem with us going out tomorrow, do you? Mikado: Hmm... You are free to do as you please, of course. Mikado: But I daresay that sounds like a date to me. Kanna: Huh? In what way? Mikado: The two of you are going out together, just the two of you. Kanna: Yeah... but we were alone that time we went out to buy me a phone too. Mikado: Be that as it may, tomorrow is the so-called Eve of Christmas Eve. Kanna: I mean, I suppose it is... Mikado: Since the cafe is open on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, neither of you would be able to take the day off work. Mikado: Do you not think that is why he chose tomorrow specifically, the 23rd, to ask you out? Kanna: You're reading too much into it. It's just a coincidence that the date happened to align like that. Mikado: Well, don't say I did not warn you. Kanna: It's not like that. I'm sure he simply wants to hang out as friends. Kanna: Besides, I'm a Grim Reaper. Takamine-san knows that full well. Mikado: I hope that he does. Kanna: You worry too much, Mikado-san. He doesn't think of me like th-- Kanna: ...... Mikado: ...... Kanna: W-We should be getting to bed. Mikado: Indeed. Whatever Takamine Kousei is thinking, we have no way of knowing. We may as well go to sleep. Kanna: (A date on the Eve of Christmas Eve? Takamine-san asking me out on a date? He'd never! Haha!) Kanna: (I know it SOUNDS like a date, but it's not.) Kanna: (He just needs my help with something.) "

            "Natsume: Welcome to Cafe Stella! Kousei: ...... Natsume: ...... Natsume: Hmm? Kousei: Ah... Kousei: ...... Kousei: Sorry to interrupt. Kousei: Err, I was going back to the kitchen to--ow, ow, ow! How is your grip so strong?! Stop! You're digging into my--ow, ow, ow, ow! Natsume: Forget everything you just saw. You did see it, didn't you? Didn't you? Yes, you. I'm talking to you. Kousei: You'll never take me alive, demon! Natsume: Who are you calling a demon?! Kousei: Relax, I'm kidding. I didn't see anything THAT bad. I mean, at least you had your clothes on this time. Natsume: Just because I'm clothed doesn't mean you're allowed to spy on me! Natsume: Now stop trying to run! Kousei: Ahhhhh! Somebody heeelp! Kousei: Don't glare at me like that... Kousei: Is it really even my fault this time? Natsume: Yes. You were peeking in through the crack in the door. Kousei: Can't deny that... Kousei: But you were the one who left the door half-open. Kousei: Why were you practicing your smile in here by yourself anyway? Kousei: I thought you were going to ask Hiuchidani-san to coach you. Natsume: She tried to... but her explanations were all based on \"feelings,\" so it was kind of hard to follow. Mei: First, try remembering something fun that you did. Mei: Next, think about how you felt back then, and let that feeling build. Mei: Then let it build... And build and build... Until it can't build no more... Then you KEEP building... And finally, you let it all out! Mei: Welcome to Cafe Stella! Kousei: ...... Kousei: I, um... sort of get what she was trying to say. Kousei: Ah, so that's why you were practicing in the mirror. Kousei: You didn't seem very satisfied with the results, though. Natsume: I don't know why, but it always ends up looking unnatural... Kousei: Isn't it because you're so pretty? Natsume: Excuse you? Kousei: That's exactly what I mean. Natsume: What are you talking about? Kousei: That ice-cold glare. On a girl with your looks, it's even more attractive than a smile. Natsume: Ugh... You're such a creep. Kousei: Okay, I know. Here's the thing. Kousei: I'm willing to bet it's been a long time since you've smiled as broadly as Hiuchidani-san. Kousei: Maybe you never even have. And if that's the case, you aren't going to master the art of smiling in one or two weeks. Natsume: W-Well... Kousei: But if we wait for you to get there, we're going to miss our October deadline. Kousei: If there's something you can't do, it's best just to admit it. Natsume: Not beating around the bush, are you? Kousei: Instead of trying to do what you can't, you should focus on doing what you can. Kousei: So greet our customers with what feels natural to you. That's what I suggest. Natsume: But my smile isn't good enough for the cafe's bright new atmosphere. Kousei: That's not true. Kousei: I think your smile is plenty attractive. Natsume: You're just saying that. Kousei: No, I actually mean it. Kousei: Remembering something fun that you did might help you form a more natural smile. Natsume: Something fun... something fun... Natsume: ...... Natsume: I don't know... I can't really think of anything. Kousei: When the cafe finally opens, we're gonna have a ton of customers enjoying themselves. Try imagining that. Natsume: O-Okay. Imagine... imagine... Natsume: Welcome to Cafe Stella! Kousei: ...... Natsume: What? Was it really that appalling? Kousei: Oh, no. I'm just speechless at how good it was. Natsume: Tch. Kousei: I'm serious. The future of the cafe hinges on this, so I wouldn't lie. Kousei: The smile you just made wasn't out of place at all. I'm sure you'll get the hang of it by the time we open. Natsume: Hmm... Well, I'll try to keep this up then. Kousei: Okay, I'm leaving. I'll make sure to close the door properly too. Natsume: Good. Kousei: Yeah? Natsume: Thank you. Kousei: No problem. Kousei: Oh, Nozomi. Just the person I wanted to see, actually. Nozomi: Sorry. I just remembered something I have to do, so I'll come back later! Kousei: Wait, don't go. It's not anything weird. I just have a normal favor to ask of you. Nozomi: And how many times have you tricked me with that very line? One, two, three... Kousei: Stop counting your fingers. Kousei: Listen, Nozomi. Look into my eyes. Nozomi: It's like I'm staring into two muddy pools. Kousei: Look closer. Kousei: I'd never try to trick you, Nozomi. Nozomi: Kousei-kun... Nozomi: How many times have you tried to use that one to sweet-talk your way out of things? Let's see... Kousei: Stop counting! Kousei: I'm not trying to trick you or anything. I was just thinking of practicing my waitering skills, so I wanted your help. I need someone to play the customer. Nozomi: Oh, is that all? Kousei: Great. Kousei: Welcome to Cafe Stella. Party of one? Nozomi: Yes. Kousei: Would a seat at the counter be okay? Nozomi: I'd prefer to sit at that table over there. Is that alright? Kousei: Of course. However, do note that we may have to ask you to move if a large party of customers comes in... Nozomi: That's fine. Kousei: Thank you. Now please, follow me. Kousei: Here's a menu. Once you've decided on your order, please let me know. Nozomi: Can I get a blend coffee, to start? Kousei: Certainly. Nozomi: Pfft. Ahaha! This is so weird! Kousei: What? Did I mess something up? Nozomi: Nope, there's nothing wrong with your service. It's just so funny seeing you act super courteous towards me. Nozomi: Still, I kind of like having you at my beck and call! Kousei: So you've finally warmed up to the idea of being my sugar mama, eh? Nozomi: No, thank you. I'll have to pass on that one. Nozomi: Now quit fooling around and bring me my coffee. Kousei: Talk about a hard-to-please customer. Nozomi: We're bound to get all kinds of people in here, so you'd better learn how to deal with one. Nozomi: C'mon! Stop slackin' off, ya bum! Hurry up and bring me my coffee! Kousei: Oh, fine. Nozomi: Is that any way to respond to a customer? Kousei: Yes, ma'am. I shall have it ready momentarily. Nozomi: Good. Ehehe. Mei: Oh? Do you need something, Senpai? Kousei: Just popping in to see how things are going. Kousei: Everything alright? Then again, you're honestly probably the last person I need to be concerned about, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Hey, that's not true. Even I have some things I'm not confident at. Kousei: Oh, that's a surprise. What kind of things? Mei: Everything aside from customer service. Kousei: If you're worried about brewing coffee or tea, you'll do fine as long as you follow Shiki-san's recipes. Kousei: It's just a matter of repetition. Keep doing it till you can do it in your sleep. Mei: Well, I was a little worried about that... but mostly, it's the parfaits I'm having trouble with. Kousei: Didn't I give you the recipe last time? Kousei: It's basically just arranging the ingredients. Mei: That's the problem. I'm super clumsy, so I've never even cooked a simple meal before. Kousei: Well, practice makes perfect. Kousei: Actually, why don't we practice right now? Mei: It's simple enough to remove all the strawberry stems. Mei: Next we add the cornflakes, then a layer of fresh cream, right? Mei: I know that much, at least... Mei: But when it comes to squeezing out the cream, I always end up using too much force. Mei: Making it look nice is really hard... Mngh... Hngh... Aww, crap. I overshot it again. Mei: Isn't there an easier way to do this? Kousei: Hmm. When I learned how to use a pastry bag, I think I was taught a trick. Kousei: It's important to relax your grip completely. Kousei: Also, remember to lift the bag straight up when you're adding the finishing touch. That way you don't mess up the nice swirl you made. Mei: Okay. Relax, lift straight up... Relax, lift straight up... Kousei: But honestly, each layer of cream is going to have strawberries on top anyway, so it doesn't need to look perfect. Mei: Strawberries, cream... Strawberries, cream... Mngh... Mei: Ahh... Phew. Does that look good? Mei: Hm? Senpai? What's the matter? Kousei: Oh, err... Mei: ...... Mei: Ah! Ahh?! Mei: Ahhhhh! Mei: O-Oh God... I screwed up again! Mei: But it's your fault this time, Senpai. You big perv! Kousei: Err, I didn't-- Mei: Didn't what? Kousei: Never mind. I'm sorry. Please forgive me. Mei: Mghh... Well... I guess I was being a bit careless too, so I won't blame you. Mei: But a boy... a boy saw my boobs! My precious first time... Mei: Does this mean I can't get married anymore? Kousei: That's way too much of an exaggeration. Mei: Well, I hope you're right... Kousei: Besides, I didn't even see anything. All I caught was a glimpse of your collarbone and your bra strap. That's it. Just a tiny peek. Mei: That doesn't make me feel any better, Senpai. If anything, you sound like even more of a perv. Kousei: Yeah... Kousei: Anyway, I'm sorry. Mei: You don't have to keep apologizing. It wasn't all your fault, Senpai. Mei: But, um, was it really was just the tip of my bra? You didn't see anything lower down... like a slip of pink, did you? Kousei: No, I did not, unfortunately. Mei: Oh. W-Well, umm... I guess that's okay... Maybe? Urk... but I'm still so embarrassed.. Kousei: ...... Mei: And you also have to let me practice this one more time! Then we both forget this little incident ever happened! Kousei: Fine by me. Mei: Good. Then it's settled! Kousei: Alright. Kousei: Hey. I just wanted to follow up on that favor I asked you about. Hiroto: Oh, that? Don't worry, I didn't forget. I talked to my sis about it. Hiroto: She didn't seem too interested, though, like I thought. I tried kicking her off her ass time and time again, but nothing. Hiroto: Given her situation, my parents aren't too keen about forcing her back to work... Kousei: I see... Hiroto: Sorry, pal. Kousei: Nah, it's fine. We shouldn't force her. Kousei: But could you do one more thing for me? Hiroto: More trouble? Kousei: Relax, it won't take long. Kousei: I want your sister to come check out our cafe. "

It's almost like there's a second me standing behind my back, staring at me in contempt. Kousei: Yeah, I know that feeling. Natsume: I feel like a complete and utter idiot. Makes me want to crawl into a hole and die... Kousei: Well, it was pretty cute. Natsume: ...... Kousei: Okay, okay. I'm sorry. I wasn't trying to make fun of you, I swear, but I'll drop the subject. Kousei: Still, why are you wearing that outfit specifically? Kousei: Are you not happy with our current uniforms? I know they're a bit of a departure from the old ones... Natsume: I mean, it's tolerable... Natsume: To be honest, I hate how my legs are so exposed in it, but I don't regret changing the uniforms in and of itself. Natsume: It brightens up the atmosphere in the place, and we're drawing in more customers than I ever thought possible. I'm happy we did that, and I'm grateful to you for the idea. Kousei: But there's still some reason you wanted to wear that outfit over it, no? Natsume: Well, I guess... It's just a selfish desire... Kousei: Okay? Natsume: I want to wear something that'll make our customers happy, of course--but this is something I wanted to wear personally. Natsume: Anyway, this was just a little experiment. Forget about it, will you? Kousei: Easier said than done. Natsume: Alright, Master. It's time to add the final ingredient--moe! Please join me. Natsume: Now, together--moe, moe, kyun! Kousei: You know, the more you tell me to, the harder it is to erase from my mind... Natsume: Want me to forcibly erase it for you? Kousei: No, thank you. Please stop threatening to knock me in the head. Natsume: *sigh*... It feels like you've seen me doing the last thing I'd ever want you to see me doing. Kousei: Well, that was all you. Kousei: Just your imagination. Kousei: Anyway, back to what we were talking about--the whole moe moe kyun thing. Natsume: Did you literally not hear a word I said? Kousei: Wait, I'm not teasing you. I'm being serious here. Kousei: That whole maid cafe shtick honestly wasn't half-bad. Natsume: Then why'd you have such a lukewarm reaction when I did it... Kousei: Well, that's 'cause you wanted me to do it WITH you. Kinda took me out of the moment and made me ask myself what the hell we're doing. Kousei: Still, I can't say I didn't like it. I actually thought it was pretty cute.  Kousei: But then again, I am a guy. Natsume: Yeah, I know. Most of our customers are women anyway. So, with that in mind... Natsume: As of today, Cafe Stella's maid service will be shut down, terminated, and discontinued. Thank you for your patronage. Natsume: We will be resuming regular waitress operations from now on, but we hope you'll keep visiting us, Master. Natsume: There you have it. Kousei: Man, that's a shame. Kousei: I think you were onto something. It had a certain... charm to it. Natsume: No need to spare my feelings. Sorry you had to go along with this silly idea of mine. Kousei: That's okay. I asked you to go to the bar with me, so we're even. Natsume: I know; I haven't forgotten. Still, we probably shouldn't drink on an empty stomach. Why don't we have dinner together first? Kousei: Wait, what? D-Dinner? T-Together? Really? Kousei: I mean, I don't mind. At all. Sure. Yes. I would very much like to. Natsume: Urk. Why are you talking like that? It's honestly gross. Kousei: What do you want? I wasn't expecting a dinner invitation. Of course I sound nervous. Natsume: You're never going to be a chad at this rate, dude. Kousei: Stop bringing that up! Natsume: Well, now we're even. Kousei: Is it really that much fun, humiliating me? Natsume: Pretty fun, yeah. Natsume: Anyway, I'm going to get changed first. Kousei: Alright. I'll wait here. Kousei: ...... Kousei: This... isn't a dinner date. We're just a pair of friends eating together. Totally normal. Natsume: It's kind of a habit. I always go home, take a bath to relax, climb into bed to sleep--then it hits me. Natsume: \"Wait, did I remember to lock the door?\" Kousei: Yeah, I can relate. And once the thought gets into your head, it won't stop nagging at you. "

            "Kousei: Hiuchidani-san? Hey. Kousei: Just finished doing some shopping, I take it? Mei: Yep. My parents asked me to run a few errands. Mei: Are you out to do some shopping too, Senpai? Kousei: Err, not quite... Kousei: I was just wandering around, looking for somewhere to eat. Mei: I don't blame you for wanting to take a break from cooking for once. It is New Year's Eve. Kousei: Yeah. Too bad most restaurants are closed, though. Kousei: But those bags look pretty heavy. Do you need a hand? Mei: Oh, no. I'm fine. My house isn't too far from here. Mei: What about you, Senpai? Aren't you planning to visit your family too? Kousei: The only family I've really got is my dad, and he's overseas. Kousei: Ah?! Mei: I heard she had to go back home because of some family matters, and apparently, she doesn't know when she'll be back. Kousei: Where'd you hear that? Mei: Mikado-san told me. Kousei: Oh. Mei: H-Huh? What is it? Was there some kind of serious accident or something? Kousei: No, nothing like that... but whatever it was, it was pretty sudden. Mei: Yeah. I hope she comes back soon. Kousei: Yeah... me too. Mei: She still hadn't finished teaching me how to brew coffee. Kousei: Coffee? Mei: For a while now, her coffee has been getting quite a reputation for its flavor, you see. Kousei: Oh. Now that you mention it... Mei: I can make a cup of coffee the way I learned before... but there's just something missing when I do it. Mei: Maybe it's just because I don't like bitter drinks. But that's why I've been practicing with Kanna-san's advice. Kousei: I can't wait. Mei: Anyway, I'd better get going. Have a happy new year, Senpai! Kousei: You too. Kousei: ...... Natsume: Ah. Kousei: Shiki-san. Out shopping? Natsume: Yeah... I'd ask how you're doing, but I think I already know the answer to that. Kousei: I guess that means you already know what happened to Kanna? Natsume: His Excellency told me that she'd gone on to be reincarnated. Kousei: Yeah. Natsume: What's on your mind, Takamine-kun? Kousei: Hmm. Kousei: I was just thinking about what kind of coffee beans to buy. Natsume: Coffee, huh? Natsume: I still can't say I understand the appeal. Any way you look at it, no one needs bitter coffee. Kousei: You don't like bell peppers either, do you? Natsume: Oh, shut up. Kousei: Out of curiosity, what kind of coffee beans do you think I should buy, Shiki-san? Natsume: Why are you asking me? I can't drink coffee unless I add enough milk and sugar to drown out the flavor. Kousei: I dunno. That's just the way the conversation was going. Natsume: What's the best-tasting coffee bean you've had up until now? Kousei: Hmm... Blue Mountain, I guess. Natsume: Oh, the really expensive one. Kousei: There's really nothing else like it. Kousei: You know what? It might be expensive, but it doesn't hurt to indulge every once in a while. Natsume: Maybe I should splurge a little and buy myself some expensive tea leaves too. Landlady: Oh, my! If it isn't Natsume-chan. Natsume: Oh! Hello, ma'am. Landlady: It's nice to see you. Oh, my. On a date, are you? Is this your boyfriend? Natsume: Absolutely not. Landlady: No? Ah, wait a moment. I remember you... Kousei: Hello. I work at Cafe Stella too. Shiki-san and I are coworkers. Landlady: Ah, of course. You're the one who works in the kitchen. Kousei: Thank you for your continued patronage. Landlady: It's my pleasure. Thank you for always making such delicious food. Kousei: My pleasure. Landlady: Not that we ever had customers lining up outside our door back then. *giggle* Landlady: I'm sorry I didn't have more faith in you from the start. Natsume: Don't be. It's only because you were reluctant to rent out the cafe to us that we all tried our hardest to change your mind. Natsume: If you'd rented it out to us without a second thought, I don't think we'd be nearly as popular with customers as we are now. Landlady: That's very kind of you to say. Landlady: But your food truly is delicious. Not only do you serve a wonderful cup of tea, but lately, I get the feeling the taste of your coffee has improved even more. Landlady: I'll be visiting you all next year as well. Natsume: Of course. We'll be waiting for you. Landlady: Well then, I'd best be going. I'd hate to interrupt your date any longer. Natsume: I told you we're not dating. Landlady: *giggle* Have a happy new year, you two. Natsume & Kousei: You too. Kousei: ...... Kousei: The landlady might be rather let down next year... when she realizes Kanna isn't here anymore. Kousei: You're right. If the cafe were to go out of business the minute she left, I'd never be able to face her again. Kousei: Besides, I've got to keep my promise to her. Natsume: What promise? Kousei: I promised her I'd keep on smiling. Natsume: Ah. Kousei: It's a pretty hard promise to keep... but we can't just let these butterflies roam free, can we? Kousei: Anyway, you don't have to worry about me, Shiki-san. Natsume: Alright. Still, if you ever need my help, just let me know. Kousei: Thanks. I will. Nozomi: Hm? Ah, Kousei-kun! Kousei: Oh? Didn't expect to see you here too, Suzune-san. Suzune: 'Sup. Kousei: What are you doing here? Suzune: I came to offer the gods a quick prayer before going back to my parents' house. Then I bumped into Nozomi-san here. Nozomi: What about you, Kousei-kun? What are you doing here? Kousei: It'd be a pain in the ass to visit the shrine later on if I want to spend my New Year's chilling, so I thought I'd drop by now since I was already out. Kousei: Is it weird, visiting in the middle of the day on New Year's Eve? Nozomi: Not at all. New Year's Eve is when we give thanks for the previous year. And the new year is when we pray for the year to come. That's all that matters. Kousei: I see. Nozomi: Oh, but don't forget to toss some cash into the offering box. Kousei: Trying to guilt me into making a donation, huh? That's not very shrine maiden-like. Nozomi: Well, I'm only a part-time shrine maiden. Ehehe. Nozomi: If you want, you're welcome to try on my outfit too, Suzune-san. Suzune: No, thanks. I'm not falling for that one. I've already decided I'm not working on New Year's. Nozomi: Aww. Well, it was worth a shot... Suzune: The holidays are all about lazing around under the kotatsu for me. Kousei: I'd have to agree. Nozomi: I don't think you should be lazing around too much, though, Kousei-kun. Kousei: Come on, it's New Year's. Besides, I've been getting up so early for work lately. It's not like I'm leading an unhealthy lifestyle. Nozomi: I know, but you've got a girlfriend now. Kousei: Kanna isn't... Nozomi: Oh, wait. She had to go home because of some family matters, didn't she? Suzune: Oh, that's right... Guess that means you're going to be by yourself for New Year's. Kousei: Yeah, probably. Suzune: That's a shame. On New Year's, of all days. Kousei: Well, it is what it is. Kousei: It would've been too selfish of me to ask her to stay. Nozomi: Well, I hope she comes back soon. Nozomi: We should totally have a New Year's party when she does! Kousei: A New Year's party? Nozomi: Yeah, like that time we all had yakiniku together! That was really fun. Kousei: Yeah. It really was. Kousei: It sure would be nice to do that again... if everyone had the time. Kousei: But even I don't know when Kanna will be back, so... Suzune: Hmm... Maybe we could all go cherry-blossom viewing? That's still a ways off, though. Nozomi: Oh, that's a great idea! Kousei: We can just have a New Year's party with those who can make it, though. Nozomi: Don't be silly. Parties are meant to be celebrated with everyone. Suzune: Yeah. What she said. Nozomi: You too! Happy New Year! Kousei: Happy New Year. Kousei: I don't want to keep you for too long either, so I'll just say my prayers then go home. Nozomi: You'd better be eating properly, you hear? If you feel too lazy to cook, I can bring you some osechi later. Kousei: Nah, that's okay. You don't need to do that. Kousei: You're gonna have your hands full helping out at the shrine for the next few days, aren't you? If I really have nothing to eat, I'll give you a call and come over instead. Nozomi: Well, alright. Kousei: You sure have it tough, though. Kousei: Normally you have to work part-time at the cafe, and now you have to help out at the shrine for New Year's. Nozomi: That's just how it is. I've accepted it as my fate for being born a Shinto priest's daughter. Still, it's not like I don't want to help at all. Nozomi: And besides, working at the cafe is fun. I doesn't feel much like a job to me. Kousei: You're always a huge help to everyone, Nozomi. In a lot of ways. Kousei: Thanks for everything you do. Nozomi: Someone's awfully honest today... You didn't eat some weird garbage off the ground, did you? Kousei: Well, it's New Year's Eve. Kousei: You're pretty much like a guardian deity to me, so I'm expressing my gratitude to you for the past year. Thank you. Nozomi: You're free to thank me any other day of the year as well, you know. Kousei: C'mon. I'm trying to be sincere here. Nozomi: Well, your delivery needs some work. Nozomi: I appreciate your gratitude, but you don't need to make up some weird excuse to say thank you. I'm sure you'd make Mom and Dad happier that way too. Kousei: Yeah, you're right. I'll stop by and say hello to them before I leave. "

Kousei: I think I'll learn a lot more that way, rather than just sitting in school. Hiroto: Hmm... Where are you gonna work then? Kousei: Probably... not at some big company. Kousei: I'm trying to learn a bit more about accounting and that sort of stuff at the cafe. And after that... Kousei: I'm thinking of asking my dad to teach me a few things too. Hiroto: Didn't you say your dad was a painter or something? Kousei: Yeah, but he also does some other consulting work on the side. Hiroto: Huh... Okay. Kousei: What about you? What are you planning on doing? Hiroto: Still trying to figure that out. Hiroto: I'm jealous as hell, though. You don't have to job hunt like the rest of us.

Hiroto: Yet you're going out with a girl that's got none? Kousei: Yeah, well... I'm more attracted to who she is on the inside. Hiroto: I don't get it... To me, she's a total menace. Kousei: Don't say that. She can be cute too, you know. Hiroto: Her? Cute? Honestly... I just don't get your tastes, man. Suzune: Gnhrgghhh... Natsume: Order coming in. I need two plates of pancakes, one with strawberry syrup and one with chocolate syrup. Suzune: A-Alright... Natsume: Hmm? Natsume: Is something the matter? Suzune: Sorry, my chest just hurts a little... Natsume: What? That sounds serious! You should go to the hospital! Suzune: Uhh, it's not the kind of chest pain you're thinking of. Natsume: But you're still in pain, aren't you? Suzune: Yes, I am.. Suzune: These wires... are really digging into my skin... Grngh... Natsume: Come again? Natsume: Ahh... Your skin's already turning red. Suzune: How the hell does wearing a bra hurt this much... Natsume: That's just how underwire bras are, I'm afraid. Suzune: I've heard the stories, but I didn't think it'd be THIS bad. Natsume: You normally wear more comfortable ones, don't you? Suzune: Yeah. I don't really need that much support, given my cup size. Natsume: You shouldn't force yourself to wear them. If they chafe too much, you might even start bleeding. Suzune: Ngh... Natsume: Why are you grimacing? Suzune: Because of that little shit, Kousei... Do you know what he said to me the first time he saw me undress? Kousei: It's hard to see you as an adult, wearing that kind of underwear... Suzune: Can you believe that? Natsume: Yes... I actually can... Suzune: Well, anyway, I figured it couldn't hurt to wear something a little more my age. Suzune: Also, I think he's a tits kind of guy, so I thought I'd throw him a bone and try on a push-up bra. Natsume: Ah, so that's why you're wearing a wire bra. Suzune: Still... pushing them together hasn't done anything except make them look like two identical acorns. Suzune: Hey, shuddup! My nipples ain't acorns, dammit! Natsume: I didn't say that. Natsume: Nobody said a single thing about your nipples. Please stop trying to use raunchy jokes to escape from reality. Suzune: Sorry... Natsume: In any case, there are plenty of nice-looking bras out there that don't have wires in them. Suzune: Would you be willing to come help me pick? Natsume: What, you mean underwear shopping? Suzune: Yeah. I've only ever worn the most comfortable bras I could find... so I don't how to find anything else. Natsume: Ah... Well, sure. I guess I don't mind. Suzune: Really?! Thank you so much! Suzune: I'll show you who's an adult woman, Kousei. Hehehe... Just you wait. Suzune: Kousei. Kousei: Yeah? What's up? Suzune: Mind if I take a break? A bit of a long one, actually. Suzune: In fact... I might not be back until closing. Kousei: Alright. That's fine. Kousei: I imagine you have some sort of reason for doing so. Suzune: Yeah. Thanks. Suzune: Don't worry, you won't regret it. Anyway, take care of things here for me. Kousei: Can do. Kousei: \"I won't regret it\"? Natsume: Suzune-san sure is cute, isn't she? It's kind of surprising how devoted she is. Kousei: What are you talking about? Natsume: Nothing. Natsume: Anyway, I'm going to be taking a rather long break as well. Don't wait up. Kousei: Oh, okay. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Both of them are taking an extended break at the same time? Kousei: Well, whatever. Kousei: Oh, well. It's just for one day, so I don't really mind. Kousei: Still... where on earth did Suzune-san go off to? Kousei: Or maybe I should just mind my own business. Kousei: Hrmh... Honestly, the subtleties of the female mind are far beyond me. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Well, at least I'm done cleaning now. Kousei: Hm? Suzune: Oh? You're finished already? Kousei: Yeah. Suzune: Damn... Sorry. I tried to hurry back as soon I could. Kousei: It's fine. Kousei: ...... Suzune: Phew... That feels so much better. Wish I would've gone with this first. Kousei: What are you talking about? Suzune: Nothin'. Don't worry about it. Kousei: Er... by the way. You don't have to answer if you don't want to, but I'm curious. Kousei: Where exactly did you go? Suzune: Where? Do you really wanna know? Kousei: Well, yeah. Suzune: Heh... *giggle*... You little horndog. Kousei: What does that have to do with anything? Suzune: Good question... *giggle* Kousei: Did you not want me asking about it? Suzune: No, that's fine. But, hmm... Suzune: Let's see. I suppose you DO deserve a reward for holding down the fort on your own... *giggle* Suzune: Is that all you want? Kousei: Well, if you're offering me something... even more appetizing, I certainly wouldn't say no. Suzune: I knew you'd say that. You're such a little perv, you know that? Kousei: Excuse me. All I said was \"something more appetizing.\" You're the perv for immediately assuming I meant something sexual. Suzune: Oh-ho? So my assumption was wrong? Kousei: Well, no. It wasn't. Suzune: That's what I thought. *giggle* Kousei: So... are you gonna tell me what you were doing that was so important you needed to skip work for? Suzune: Hmph... Feast your eyes. Kousei: *gulp*... Suzune: *giggle*... I like that reaction. Suzune: This is a little... no, very embarrassing... but seeing you make that face makes it all worth it. Kousei: Well, your underwear is just... that cute and sexy. Suzune: Does it turn you on? Kousei: You have no idea. Hell, there's no way I wouldn't be turned on. Suzune: Looks like it... *giggle* You're hard as a rock. Kousei: I had no idea you were into this... Suzune: Actually, what I'm \"into\" is making my boyfriend happy. Kousei: Well, I'm really happy. That erotic lingerie looks amazing on you. Suzune: Oh, come on. It's not THAT erotic. Kousei: I mean, compared to the pairs you usual wear... it definitely is. Suzune: Is it, though? I don't have any boobs. Kousei: It still turns me on. Suzune: *giggle*... You perv... Kousei: I don't wanna hear that coming from someone wearing sexy underwear. Suzune: Yeah, I guess... Even I'm surprised at how dirty a girl I've become... Suzune: It's all your fault. Suzune: All your reactions are just too cute... way too cute. Kousei: Well, you say you like them. Suzune: Yeah, but, like... Actually, wait. Aren't you staring a little TOO much? Kousei: It's not my fault... I can't stop myself. Kousei: You went through the trouble of buying a pair of sexy lingerie for my sake, after all. Suzune: I told you, stop calling it that. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Just out of curiosity... What do your panties look like? Suzune: They came in a set, obviously... Do you want to see them? Kousei: Absolutely. Suzune: Geez, you really are a perv. Suzune: *giggle* I like that reaction. It's nice and honest. Kousei: What, and yours isn't? Kousei: I've been staring at you this whole time. Suzune: Well... yeah... It's been flipped a little bit, I guess. Kousei: Only a little? Suzune: Yes... Kousei: You did buy these specifically to show me... Suzune: Well, if you're that crazy about me... I guess I kinda have to. Kousei: Well, I won't deny that I'm crazy for you... Kousei: I knew you were turned on. You're ridiculously turned on. Suzune: Ugh... I can't believe I'm getting these wet on the very day I bought them. Kousei: Don't worry. Mine are just as wet. Suzune: That doesn't make me feel any better... Wait. They are? Kousei: Yep. They're sticky with cum. Suzune: Then why don't you take them off? Kousei: Huh? Suzune: I mean, you don't want them getting any more dirty, so why not just take your dick out? Suzune: Plus it's embarrassing for me to be the only one doing this... Hurry up and show me your body too. Kousei: This all is your fault, just so you know. Suzune: It's so hard... and stiff... *pant* *pant*... It's hard not to remember... Suzune: But if I take them off, how are you gonna get a good look at them? I bought them for you, remember? Kousei: Well, do you want them to get dirty? Suzune: N-No. I just bought them... It'd be a shame if they got any dirtier than they already are. Kousei: You're totally soaked. Suzune: This is... the first time I've ever gotten this wet without touching it... Kousei: Don't you normally get this wet when you touch it? Suzune: I mean... You'd know more about that than me. Kousei: I guess so. Kousei: I was just wondering if you've ever masturbated... Suzune: Why do you want to know? Kousei: Well... I kinda want to see how you do it. Suzune: How I do it? *pant* *pant*... I just do it normally, I guess... Kousei: That's my point. I don't know what \"normally\" means. Kousei: I'm a guy. Suzune: I mean, I don't know what to tell you... It's not like I masturbate THAT often... Suzune: *pant*... *pant*... *inhale*... *pant*... Kousei: ...... Suzune: *pant*... Gosh, could you not stare so much? Kousei: I'm just curious. So this is how you do it... Right there's your clit, right? Suzune: *pant* *pant*... Y-Yeah. This is the spot I usually like to touch... Nhh?! Mhh, mhh! Kousei: You really like playing with your clit, huh? Kousei: You seem like you'd enjoy fingering yourself too, though. Suzune: Mhh! Ah, ah! Nh... It doesn't feel as good... when I do it myself... *pant* *pant*... Suzune: I think I like it better when you do it instead... Nh, nhhh! Kousei: That makes me... ridiculously happy to hear. Suzune: Gosh... It's your fault I've become such a dirty girl. Kousei: That's supposed to be a compliment, right? Suzune: Yeah... Nhhh! My fingers won't stop... *pant* *pant* *pant*... *pant*... Kousei: C'mon. Let me get a better look. Suzune: Nooo... *pant* *pant*... *pant* *pant*... Kousei: You're not about to cum already, are you? Kousei: Judging my how much you're twitching, though... it looks like you are. Suzune: I don't know! I don't know, but... Suzune: Ah, ah, ahhh! This feels so good... It really turns me on, being watched while I do this... Ahhhh! Kousei: *pant*... *pant*... *pant*... Suzune: W-Wow... Your dick is so stiff it's almost touching your stomach... and it's leaking so much too... Kousei: I feel like I'm about to explode just from watching you masturbate... Suzune: You sure have a spunky dick, don't you? Kousei: Don't act like you don't love it. Suzune: Yeah, I do... I love your hard dick... Just remembering how good it felt last time is enough to make me... Ahh! Ahhhh! Kousei: That's fine. Do it. Show me how you cum. Suzune: *pant*... *pant*... So do you... Kousei: I can't hold back anymore. You'll take responsibility for making me so horny... won't you? Kousei: I'd expect a proper adult woman to. Suzune: You're right. I am an adult woman... *giggle* Suzune: Ahh! H-Hold on... You want to do it like this? Kousei: You don't? Suzune: Well, the problem is... my feet can't even touch the ground. Kousei: Don't worry. I'll support you. Kousei: I'll support you no matter what, Suzune-san. Suzune: I thought you said you wanted ME to take responsibility... I can't do anything like this. Kousei: Come on... Please? Suzune: There you go, giving me those puppy-dog eyes again... You just wanted to give this a try, didn't you? Suzune: Fine. Have it your way. Kousei: That's why I love you. Suzune: Yeah, yeah... But if I tell you it hurts, then you'd better pump the brakes, mister. Kousei: Hmm... I'll try my best. No guarantees, though. Kousei: It feels way too good inside you. My brakes might end up malfunctioning. Suzune: Why am I not surprised? In fact, it feels like you're on the verge of losing control already... Suzune: Well... that's because I already came once... Kousei: I take it you're more than ready then? Suzune: You don't need to ask. Kousei: You're right. Sorry. Kousei: This where I'm supposed to take the initiative, right? Suzune: A-Ah, ahhh! Nghhh?! Kousei: Doesn't seem like it hurt, though. Kousei: Your body's gotten so greedy. Suzune: Who's fault do you think that is? Ah, ahh, ah, ahh! Kousei: Huh? Suzune: Urk! Nhhggghhhhhh! Kousei: Ngh... You're tightening up so much... Kousei: Did you just cum again? Suzune: Ahh! *pant* *pant*... *pant*... *pant*... Kousei: All I did was put it in, you know? Suzune: I couldn't help it, okay? I'm still sensitive from cumming earlier... *pant*... *pant*... Suzune: Are you saying I wasn't cute at first? Kousei: I'm saying your cuteness has skyrocketed. You were cute at first, but now you're ridiculously cute. Kousei: I love you... so much... Suzune: Ahhh?! Kousei: It feels amazing for me too. Kousei: You're so hot and sticky... I don't think I can control myself. Suzune: You perv... Kousei: Right back at ya. Suzune: Yeah, you're right... We're both huge perverts. Kousei: Agreed. Kousei: Especially... this dirty pussy of yours. Kousei: See? Look how tightly it's gripping me. Suzune: Y-Yeah... because you're rubbing me with something so thick... Nghh! Ah?! Ah, ah?! Suzune: W-Wait, wait! You're rubbing me too much! Ahhhhhh! Kousei: That's only because you're clamping down so tightly... Nhh... Kousei: You're squeezing all my sensitive spots... Ngh... Suzune: Ahhh, ah! Ah, ah! You're hitting all my weak spots too! Ah, ah, ah! Kousei: You mean... right here? Suzune: Ahhhhhh! Yes, right there! That feels amazing! Nhhhhhhh! Kousei: You like this spot, don't you? Suzune: Ahh! Yes, yes, yes! Ah, ahhh! Oh god! I'm going crazy! Ahhhhhh! Kousei: You look so cute right now... So sexy. Suzune: *pant* *pant*... *pant*... Your dick is so hot and hard... It feels so good! Kousei: S-Suzune-san! Kousei: I'm sorry, but I can't stop... I can't stop myself anymore! Suzune: Your switch is totally flipped! Ahhhh! Nhhh, ack... Ahhhh! Kousei: I'm way past my tipping point... Your pussy feels way too good! Suzune: Ah, ah, ah, ah! Ngh... Nghh?! Kousei: I can keep grinding you like this, right? Suzune: Nhhhh! Y-Yes, keep going! Ah, ahh! Ahh! Kousei: I'll do what I can! Suzune: Nh, ahh, ahhhhhh! *pant* *pant* *pant*! I love that, I love that! Kousei: Suzune-san, Suzune-san! Suzune: *pant* *pant* Ahhh! More! More, more! Ah, ah, ah, ahhhhhhh! Suzune: I can't help iiitttt... Ahhhhhhh! You're gonna make me cum... You're making me cum! Kousei: I'm... about to cum too! Suzune: Ah, ah, ahhh! You're getting so big... swelling up inside me so much! Nh, ahhhh! Kousei: I can keep going, can't I? I can, right? Actually, I'm sorry--I can't stop myself anymore. Suzune: Nh, nhh! It's okay... You can cum... Just please, keep grinding... Ah, ah, ahhh! Suzune: I've never! I've never felt this good befoooore! Kousei: You're making such a dirty face... Suzune: I can't control it! Ah! Ah! Ahhhhhhhh! Suzune: No, wait! Wait! Just a little longer! Ahh! Kousei: Ngh, hngh! Kousei: Suzune-san, Suzune-san! I'm cumming! Suzune: Nhh, nghh! Me too! Ahh! Me too! I'm cumming... I'm cumming, I'm cumming, I'm cumming! Suzune: Ngh, ahhhhhhhhh! Suzune: Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh! Suzune: *pant* *pant*... Getting creampied... feels amazing... Kousei: Ngh... Your pussy's wringing me dry... Kousei: *pant*... *pant*... This seems a little uncomfortable for you, though. Kousei: I'm gonna let you down, okay? Suzune: O-Okay... But if you take it out right now... Nghh?! Kousei: S-Suzune-san, I'm cumming... I'm gonna cum, okay? Kousei: I-I'm cumming! Suzune: Ah, ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Suzune: Gosh, you cum too much... *pant*... *pant*... But it felt amazing. Kousei: It felt amazing for me too... Suzune: I can hardly stand... Kousei: Don't worry. I've got you. Suzune: Thanks... but no round two, okay? I seriously can't. Kousei: ...... Suzune: Oh, come on. Don't pretend like you cant hear me, you little perv. Suzune: Seriously, though. You got way too carried away. Kousei: Only because you were showing off your bra and panties to me. Suzune: So I take it they were to your liking? Kousei: Do you really need to ask? Suzune: I guess not. *giggle* Kousei: They got me super horny. Kousei: Almost TOO horny... After all that, my body feels kinda drained. Suzune: Well, good. If I'm being honest, though, I wanted something that would make my boobs a little bigger. Kousei: Don't worry. It would be all the same, either way. Suzune: Wow. You want an ass-beatin'? Kousei: Sorry, I didn't mean it like that. Kousei: I just meant I'm happy you went out of your way to pick these for me. That's all that matters. Suzune: Really? Kousei: Yeah. Suzune: Well, the truth is... I actually bought a couple other bras as well. Kousei: Lemme see! Suzune: Whoa, whoa. I thought you said you were already drained? Kousei: I'm not saying we have to do it today. Kousei: We'll have plenty of opportunities in the future to put them to good use. Suzune: Yeah, you're right. Suzune: After all, you promised you'd continue supporting me forever, didn't you? Kousei: That I did. Suzune: Perfect! I'm gonna hold you that. "

            "Natsume: Hmm. The simpler the better, I guess. Natsume: What about you, Kousei? Kousei: I don't really like wearing flashy stuff either. Also, I prefer loose-fitting clothes. Natsume: Hmm. Kousei: Y-Yeah? Natsume: I was thinking--why don't you try working on the dining floor sometime? Kousei: You mean at work? Kousei: Where's this coming from? Natsume: You're tall, you're fit. If you clean up a bit, I think you'd look pretty handsome. Natsume: You might even find yourself some fans among the neighborhood housewives, like His Excellency. Kousei: Err, I'm not exactly interested in older women. Kousei: And I already have you anyway. I can do without the attention. Kousei: Actually, would you really be okay with other women fawning over me? Natsume: Well... Natsume: I guess I'd rather not have that. But still... Kousei: Yeah? Natsume: It feels like a bit of a shame for you to be cooped up in the kitchen all the time, with how good-looking you are... Natsume: Plus, there's that thing we talked about earlier. Kousei: The afternoon tea thing? Natsume: Yeah. We're going to be targeting housewives during that time interval, right? Natsume: In that case, we should have Akizuki-san switch places with you in the kitchen, while you work on the dining floor. Natsume: It'd be better to have more butlers as opposed to more maids. Natsume: Also... I kind of want to see you all suited up like a butler for once. Kousei: \"Suited up\"? Kousei: I'm not a big fan of tight collars, though... Natsume: After how you made me dress up in cosplay, you can't do me one favor? Kousei: Look, all I did was suggest the idea. You're the one who chose to wear it... Natsume: Stop countering me with facts and logic. Kousei: Then why make the argument if you know you're wrong? Natsume: Oh, come on. It's not like I'm asking you to wear something as embarrassing as that qipao. Kousei: Well, as long as it's similar to what Mikado usually wears, I guess it won't be too terribly embarrassing... Natsume: Oh, I know! I'll even pick out a necktie for you. Kousei: This isn't something we can just decide on the spur of the moment, though. Kousei: We'll have to discuss it with Akizuki-san and the others first. Natsume: Yeah, but you'll still be needing a new necktie. You know, since you'll be getting plenty of opportunities to wear a suit when you start job hunting. Kousei: Ugh... Don't remind me of that. Kousei: C'mon, let's grab something to eat before we leave. I'm starving. Natsume: Phew. I'm stuffed. Kousei: What do you wanna do now? Get a couple drinks at that bar again? Natsume: Hmm. I guess I wouldn't mind that, but... Kousei: But? Natsume: ...... Kousei: If you have something else in mind, I'm all ears. Natsume: I just wanted to tell you how happy I was that you put so much thought into the waitress uniform thing. Kousei: ...... Kousei: So? Natsume: S-So do you, umm, want to... have sex? Natsume: Can we? Kousei: Huh... Rather assertive today, aren't we? Natsume: Like I said, I can't express how I feel with words alone. This is the only other way I know how. Kousei: ...... Natsume: Sorry for being so horny... Kousei: Nothing wrong with that. That's what I love about you, Natsume. Say no more. Kousei: Let's go. Natsume: What? H-Hey, wait! Kousei: ...... Natsume: Y-You pick. Any of them are fine, just hurry up and choose. Kousei: A-Alright. Kousei: Yeah. It's a lot bigger than your average business hotel room, that's for sure. Almost feels like a luxury hotel--not that I've ever stayed in one. Natsume: I know what you mean. Natsume: I felt so nervous coming in. Kousei: Same here. Kousei: In fact, I'm still nervous as hell. Natsume: Yeah... My heart won't stop pounding either. Kousei: I can't help it... It's embarrassing having you take my pants off for me... Kousei: Plus, it kinda feels like you're keeping me in suspense on purpose. Natsume: I'm not. I just can't seem to get them off properly, for some reason... Natsume: What?! S-Sorry! Kousei: It's okay. Nothing to apologize for. Just, try and relax a little. It'll be easier to take them off that way. Kousei: Or should I just take them off myself? Natsume: No. Let me do it, please. I want to. Kousei: What are you talking about? You already saw it last time. Natsume: I know what it feels like, but this is my first time seeing it up close. Kousei: That sounded kinda hot. Natsume: Shut up. Natsume: Still, though... Huh... Hmm... Hrmm... I didn't know it got this big... Kousei: You're making me self-conscious the way you're examining it like that... Natsume: Oh, sorry. I don't think you have anything to be embarrassed about, though. You should be... proud of it. Kousei: Y-You think so? Natsume: W-Wait, are you... are you about to cum? Kousei: No, not yet. I'm not that quick. Kousei: But, uh... are you just planning to stare at it, or what? Natsume: O-Oh, right. A promise is a promise. Kousei: Thank you. Natsume: No, thank you. Kousei: ...... Natsume: Ah... sorry. I'm not trying to keep you waiting. It's just, while they taught me what to do... this is my first time actually doing it. Natsume: Still, I haven't even done anything yet, but you've been rock hard this entire time. Kousei: That's just how much I'm looking forward to it. Natsume: I'll do my best... *kiss* Kousei: Ngh?! Kousei: Sorry. Natsume: *giggle* That must've felt pretty good, huh? Natsume: But you know, now that I get a good look at it... it's actually kind of cute. Kousei: Well, I'll take \"cute\" over \"grotesque\" or \"alien-like\" any day of the week. Natsume: Ah... I guess I can see why some people would say those too. Kousei: Hey, listen, Natsume. Can I be frank with you? Natsume: Sure, I guess? Kousei: The way you're stopping every time I twitch... is killing me. Natsume: Oh, really? That desperate look on your face is pretty cute too. Kousei: C'mon... Natsume: Okay, okay. I get the message. Here I go... Mhh. Kousei: Ahh! Natsume: Pfft. That's some noise you let out just now. This is getting kind of fun... *giggle* Kousei: ...... Natsume: Okay, okay. I'll keep going. Now hold still... Nhh... *smooch* *smooch*... *smack*... Natsume: *kiss*... *smooch* *smooch*... *giggle* You're really starting to moan now. Kousei: No shit I am. Kousei: Ahh... Natsume: *lick* *lick*... Ahhh... *smooch* *smack*... *slurp*... Kousei: N-Natsume... Natsume: I've gotten a bit more used to it now... *slurp* *kiss* *smack*... Nh, ngh... Nhh?! Kousei: Wh-What?! Natsume: Well, something bitter's coming out... Is this poison? Kousei: The hell?! What am I, a scorpion?! Natsume: What? But it's so bitter... Natsume: And the tip is getting all wet too. What is this? Kousei: It's pre-cum, Cowper's fluid, whatever you want you want to call it. It's not poison. Just a normal bodily reaction. Natsume: Oh... So this is pre-cum. Is it supposed to be this bitter? Kousei: I guess it probably depends on your overall health? I'm really not sure, though. Kousei: Can't say I've ever tasted my own pre-cum before. Natsume: Well, as long as it isn't poisonous... *lick* *slurp* Kousei: I know you don't like bitter things, Natsume. You don't have to force yourself to taste it. Natsume: What? I'm not forcing myself. It might be bitter, but it's nowhere near as bad as coffee. I can handle this. Natsume: *lick* *lick* *slurp*... *pant* *pant*... *smack* *smooch* *slurp* Kousei: Kgh... Ahh... "

            "Kousei: ...... Kousei: Speaking of which, it's almost White Day. Kousei: Thanks for the chocolate cake last time, everyone. Suzune: Speaking of which, we never heard what you thought of it, did we? Kousei: It was really good. Thanks for adding that hint of bitterness to it. Kanna: Nozomi-san told us you preferred it that way. Mei: Suzune-san was pretty much teaching us as we went along, but it really did turn out delicious! Suzune: You were sampling it way too much, though. Mei: Ahaha! Sorry about that. Kousei: Anyway, I wanted to give you guys these baked sweets as thanks. Nozomi: Very well. Nozomi: Wow, you got individual gifts for all of us? Thanks! Suzune: I kinda feel bad since we just gave you one thing from all of us. Kousei: It's fine. I just thought it'd look better if I wrapped everyone's gifts individually. Kousei: But seeing as I had to buy enough for all of you, the portions are a little small. Sorry. Mei: Oh, you don't have to worry about that. This is more than enough. Thank you. Kanna: Absolutely. It's the thought that counts, not the size of the gift. Nozomi: But speaking of size, that big gift you've got there must be for Natsume-san, right? Kousei: Well, yeah. Suzune: Are those baked goods as well? Kousei: Yeah. I also got her some tea leaves, and a couple other small accessories. Stuff like that. Kousei: She tends to dislike holidays that we're socially obliged to celebrate, see. Suzune: I doubt she'd be unhappy with a gift from her boyfriend. Kousei: Well, I hope so. Suzune: Honestly, she'd probably be MORE upset if you arbitrarily decided that she didn't want anything. Kanna: I agree. Mei: You have to be mindful of your girlfriend's feelings. Nozomi: No girl wants to think you've forgotten about her. Kousei: I'll take that advice to heart. Thanks. Natsume: I've got another order for you. A sandwich and a pancake with chocolate sauce, on the double. Kousei: Got it. Kousei: Can you make the sandwich, Suzune-san? Suzune: Sure. I'll get to it once I'm done cooking this. Kousei: Thanks. Kousei: Well, it is White Day. Suzune: Too bad you have to spend the day working, though. Kousei: No way around it, unfortunately. And I can always give Natsume her gift after work. Kousei: The stuff I got her isn't going to spoil anytime soon, so I'm in no rush. Suzune: Then how about this? As long as you keep up the good work, I'll handle the cleanup by myself so you can leave a little early. Kousei: ...... Suzune: What? Too grateful for words? Kousei: No. Just wondering if pigs are going to start flying. Suzune: Haha. Very funny, you little snot. Kousei: I'm just messing with you. No need to take it so seriously. Kousei: But are you sure about this? Suzune: Yeah, why not? It's not gonna kill me. And I'd hate to stand in the way of your relationship. Kousei: Thank you! Suzune: You scratch my back, I scratch yours; that's how it works. Anyway, get back to focusing on that frying pan. Kousei: Yes, ma'am! Nozomi: Order coming in! I need a strawberry pancake and a strawberry parfait, please! Kousei: Coming right up. Kousei: Thanks, boss. I'll leave the rest to you then. Kousei: My bad. I didn't think you were already changing. Natsume: You really need to be more careful. If another girl was changing in here, I would've crushed your eyeballs. Kousei: It's hard to tell if you're joking sometimes. Natsume: Anyway, the others insisted I go home early today. I think they were trying to be considerate of us. Natsume: Same thing happen to you, I assume? Kousei: I wouldn't say \"insisted\". Suzune-san just offered to take care of the cleanup for me. Natsume: Ah. Well, if they're willing to do all of this for us, I guess we might as well accept their kindness. Kousei: Yeah. Kousei: So, listen. I've got something for you, Natsume. Kousei: It's your White Day gift, but, umm... this is my first time giving my girlfriend anything like this. Kousei: So if you aren't happy with it, try not to get TOO upset at me. Natsume: Oh, relax. Don't start making excuses before I've even seen it. Kousei: Sure. Natsume: Let's see... Ohh, sweets. And tea leaves too? Wait, aren't these pretty expensive? Kousei: Well, it's a return gift. Kousei: White Day gifts are supposed to be three times the value of the gift received, right? Natsume: I hear people expect it to be five times, these days. Kousei: Seriously? Talk about greedy... Natsume: Well, some people, anyway. But I don't think an expensive gift necessarily makes for a better gift. Natsume: Rather than spending three times the money, I'd be happier if you spent three times as much time with me instead. Kousei: I'll remember that. Natsume: But that doesn't mean I'm not happy with this gift. Thanks. Natsume: Let's have some of this tea together next time. I'll brew it for you. Kousei: Sounds great. Natsume: Hm? There's something else in here... Natsume: ...... Natsume: What is this? A blindfold? Kousei: A little something extra. Natsume: Ahem. Kousei: I mean, you gave me an extra kiss with your chocolate too, remember? Kousei: And that meant I had to give you something worth three times as much. Kousei: So, after a lot of thinking, I came up with the idea of a blindfold... Do you like it? Natsume: What kind of question is that? Are you stupid? Kousei: Come on! How am I supposed to know what three times a kiss is worth?! Natsume: Well, yes, but a BLINDFOLD? Are you serious? Kousei: Doing it while blindfolded is pretty exciting, though. From what I've read, at least. Natsume: ...... Kousei: Hey, you promised you wouldn't get upset! Come on! Natsume: That's for me to decide, not you, Kousei. Kousei: Sorry. Natsume: *sigh*... Natsume: You really are a pervert. Kousei: ...... Natsume: So? When are we trying it out? Kousei: Wait. Really? Natsume: What? You don't want to? I thought you said it was... pretty exciting? Natsume: Oh, shut it. Kousei: Anyway... how about tonight? Kousei: ...... Kousei: O-Oh, sorry. I spaced out for a second there. Kousei: I gotta ask, though. Uhh, why are you wearing your uniform? Natsume: I thought you'd like it more if I did... Kousei: You must really think I'm some kind of pervert, Natsume. Kousei: I mean, I won't deny I like it. But still. Natsume: I'm starting to get kind of excited too. Kousei: I haven't even done anything yet, though. Natsume: It's pitch black in front of me, I can't see a thing, and my arms are tied too... Kousei: But you like it, don't you? Natsume: Well... I guess I do. Kousei: Natsume... Natsume: Don't worry. I can actually feel my way around... surprisingly easily. Kousei: Nhh... Ah... Natsume: *giggle*... You're already starting to moan. Kousei: Yeah, 'cause I'm ridiculously turned on right now. Natsume: I can see that. In fact... aren't you even bigger than usual? Kousei: I dunno... I can't really tell myself. Natsume: I can't believe seeing your girlfriend like this makes you this big... You really are a hopeless pervert. Kousei: Is it really that noticeable? Natsume: It is... See? Ahmph. Kousei: Ah... Ngh?! Natsume: Nh... My mouth's getting all sticky... Don't tell me you're leaking pre-cum already? Kousei: Y-Yeah... I don't know if I'm actually bigger than usual or not... Kousei: But I am incredibly aroused, I can tell you that much. Natsume: Are you gonna cum soon? Kousei: If I let my guard down, I just might. Natsume: *giggle*... Well, you'd better hold it in. I'm just getting started here. Nhhh... *lick* *lick*... Kousei: *gulp*... Kousei: Ngh! Kousei: You seem... eager. Natsume: Hmm? Do I? *lick*... *slurp* *slurp* *lick*... Kousei: The way you use your tongue... Kousei: Don't tell me you... actually want my cum? Do you... actually think it tastes good? Natsume: What? Please. How could something that smelly and sticky taste good? If anything, it's disgusting. Kousei: O-Oh. Natsume: How about I feed it to you mouth-to-mouth next time so you can see for yourself? Natsume: I never said that. Kousei: Huh? Natsume: It's smelly and goopy, and in a lot of ways, kind of gross. Natsume: But... I never said I hated it. *lick* *lick*... *slurp* *slurp*... *suck* Kousei: Ahh... Ngh... O-Oh. Kousei: In that case... please, keep going. Natsume: Nhh... *kiss* *kiss* *lick* *lick*... Kousei: Ahhh! You sure you've got that blindfold on properly? Natsume: Yeah, I think so... Why? Kousei: Because you're way too precise... Kousei: You shouldn't be able to do this if you can't see, right? Natsume: Of course I can. After all... how many times do you think I've been bullied by this dick of yours? Natsume: I've already memorized its shape... *lick* *lick*... *slurp* *slurp*... Kousei: Ngh, ah... *pant* *pant*... *pant*... Natsume: *giggle*... You're moaning so much. Does it feel that good? *slurp*... Nh... Natsume: Well, too bad... You can't cum yet. Not until I say so... Ahmph. Kousei: Ah, ahh! Natsume: *slurp*... Mhhh... Nhhh! Mhh, mngh... *slurp* *slurp* Kousei: Your mouth is so warm, Natsume... Ngh! Natsume: *slurp* *suck* *suck*... I'll warm you up even more... *slurp* *slurp* *slurp* Kousei: Ngh! Natsume: I don't need to see now that it's in my mouth, do I? Ngh, nhh... *suck* *suck*! Kousei: Still, though... Ngh... This feels even better than usual. Natsume: *slurp*... *slurp* *slurp*... Ahh! *pant*... *pant*... Natsume: Probably because you're turned on more than usual. Kousei: You're not giving me much of a choice! Natsume: You want to shoot out your thick, sticky loads, don't you? Ahmph... *slurp* *slurp* *suck* *suck* *suck*! Kousei: Ngh, ahh... If you suck that hard... Natsume: You can't cum yet, okay? Not yet... *suck*... *suck* *suck* *suck*! Kousei: Then please, slow down a little! Natsume: *giggle*... You're twitching so happily, though. But it doesn't matter how much you struggle... you're not getting away. Natsume: Nh... *suck* *suck* *slurp*... *suck* suck* *slurp*... Nghh! Kousei: Ahhhh! You're sucking so hard! Natsume: Nhh... Nhh *slurp*... *suck* *suck* *suck*... *slurp* *slurp* Kousei: Natsume, that... that feels amazing... And your expression too... It's so lewd... Natsume: *suck* *suck*... Nhhh... *lick* *lick* *lick*... Natsume: Shut up... You can't even see my face with this blindfold on... *slurp* *suck* Kousei: Even with the blindfold, I can tell how excited you're getting. Kousei: You're enjoying this, aren't you? Natsume: *suck* *suck*... *suck* *suck* *slurp*... Natsume: This lewd taste and smell... it's getting even thicker... Mghh... Nh, nhhh... Nhh! Kousei: Ahhhhh?! Kousei: Natsume, that... A-Ahh... If you suck me like that, I'm gonna--! Natsume: Nhh... Nh, nhh... *suck* *suck* *slurp* *slurp*! Kousei: Wait! Ahh! Kousei: You say that, but... Ahh, I can't! Natsume: *suck* *suck* Fine... You can cum. I want you to cum... Shoot out your hot, sticky stuff... *slurp*... Kousei: Ahh, Natsume! I'm gonna cum... I can't hold it anymore! Natsume: Mhhh? Nh... Nh... *suck*! Kousei: W-Wait, let go! If you don't let go I'm gonna--! Natsume: It's fine, do it... I'll swallow it for you again... Mhhhh *suck*! Kousei: You said it was... Ngh... Gross, didn't you? Don't... Ah... Force yourself... Natsume: I'm not... I'll swallow it... I wanna drink... your freshly-squeezed cum... Can't I? Kousei: N-Natsume! Kousei: A-Ahh! I'm gonna cum... I'm gonna cum, Natsume! Natsume: Nhhh, nghh... Ngh... Mhhh... *suck* *suck* *slurp*! Natsume: *slurp* *slurp* *suck* *suck* *suck*... *suck*! Kousei: Ahhhh! Nggghhhhhh! Natsume: Mhhh?! Hngh, nhh, nhhh... *pant* *pant*... Nh, nhhh... Natsume: Ngh... *gulp*... *gulp*... *gulp*... Kousei: Ngh! Natsume: Nghhhh... Ahh! *cough* *cough*! *pant* *pant* *pant*... Natsume: It's so thick... *cough* *cough*! I-I thought was going to die... choking to death on your cum... *pant* *pant*... Kousei: I want to mark you as mine. Natsume: Mhh? Nhh... Nhhh... Ahh! *pant* *pant*... *pant*... Natsume: Well, if you put it that way... Fine... *lick* *smack* *slurp*... *lick* *lick*... Kousei: Ah, right there... That's the spot... Natsume: *lick* *slurp*... *lick* *lick* *suck*... *slurp* *slurp* *smack* Kousei: Nhh... Ngghhhhh! Natsume: *gasp*?! Nhh, ngh, nhh! Ahhh! Nghhh! Natsume: Ahhh! *pant* *pant*... Kousei: Who wouldn't, after all that? *pant* *pant*... Natsume: You're all out of breath too... Here, let me clean you up... Mhh *lick* *lick*... *pant* *pant*... Natsume: Actually... it's kind of hard to clean you properly with the blindfold on. Can I take it off yet? Kousei: ...... Kousei: No, not yet. Natsume: What? Why not? Kousei: Because... I'm the only one who's been feeling good so far. Now it's my turn to return the favor--three times as much. Natsume: What are you--? Kousei: C'mon... Up you go. Natsume: Huh? A-Ahh, wait! Kousei: Here we--go! Natsume: Ahhh?! Kousei: ...... Natsume: What? Why aren't you saying anything? Stop it, you're making me nervous... Kousei: Your boobs are crazy soft... Natsume: Nhh, ah... W-Well... They are natural... Kousei: There is one spot... that's rather hard, though. Natsume: Ahh! Ah, ah... Nhh... Not my nipples... *pant*... Ahh... Nghh... Natsume: Why is it so thrilling... being touched like this? Kousei: I love you, Natsume... Natsume: Nh, nhh?! Don't whisper in my ear like that... You're making my heart race... *pant* *pant* *pant*... Kousei: You're even hornier than usual today. Natsume: That's because... the blindfold... It's getting me so excited... Kousei: Are you that eager to do it already? Kousei: You like it, don't you? Natsume: Ahh?! Nhh, nh, nhh... Hngh! Kousei: You're already so hot and wet down here. Natsume: Because... Ah, ahh, ngh... Ngh... *pant* Ahh... Ahhh! Natsume: Don't tease me like this... *pant*... *pant*... *pant*... *pant*... Kousei: You gotta let me recover. I just came a little while ago, you know... Kousei: *pant*... *pant*... I'm sorry, Natsume. Natsume: Huh? What are you--? Kousei: I can't hold back any longer. Natsume: Ahhh?! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh! Ngghhh! Kousei: I wanted to surprise you. The truth is, I wanted to keep teasing you some more... Kousei: But you just looked so sexy, I couldn't help myself. Kousei: Are you mad? Natsume: Ah, ahhh... Nh, nhh... I don't like it when you lie... but I'm not mad. Natsume: Ahhhhhhh... Your dick... is finally... *pant* *pant*... *pant*... Kousei: Does it really make things that different? Natsume: It feels like... my other senses are becoming more sensitive... since I can't see... Kousei: Ngh... That feels good. Kousei: The way your pussy wraps around me... Natsume: I can feel your dick so clearly... bucking around inside me... Ah! Ah, ah, ah, ahhhhh! Natsume: Nhh, ahh! It feels so good... I'm going crazy! Kousei: Me too... It's like I'm losing my mind. Natsume: You were already an idiot from the start, though... *pant* *pant* *pant*... Kousei: Oh, yeah? I'm gonna make you regret saying--that! Natsume: Nhh, eek?! Ah, agh... Ahh... Right there! Kousei: Here? Natsume: Ngh, ahh! Y-Yes... I love it when you pound me there! Natsume: Huh? In a bad way? Kousei: No way. It mind-blowing. Natsume: Ah, ah... Ah, ah, ah! If you grind that spot... I'm gonna melt! Natsume: If you keep grinding me there, my heads gonna meeelt! Natsume: Ahh! Ah, ahhhh... You're digging so deep... Nhh! Kousei: I love you... I love you, Natsume... I love you, I love you, I love you... Natsume: Ah, ah, ah! Don't whisper like that... It tickles! Natsume: But... it makes me so happy... It's making me feel even better... Ah, ahh, ahhhhhhh! Kousei: Your tits are so soft... and your moans are so lewd... I love how cute you are. Natsume: Ahhhhh... I'm so happy... Ah, ah, ahh... I love you... I love you too! Kousei: Natsume, Natsume! Natsume: Ah! Ah! Ah, ah, ah! That... That feels amaziiiinggg! Natsume: Nooo! I'm really gonna turn into a pervert... If you rub me there, I'm really gonna turn into a pervert! Kousei: *pant* *pant* *pant*... Natsume... Can I take off your blindfold? Natsume: Ahh, *pant*! Wuh? Wh-Why now? Kousei: Because you sound like you're losing your mind. Kousei: I love listening to you moan... but I want to see what kind of expression you're making right now too. Natsume: N-Nooooo... You can't, you can't! Natsume: I'm making a really naughty expression right now! Ah, ahh, ahh... You can't, you can't, you can't! Natsume: Nooo, don't looook... You idiot... Kousei: I love seeing you feeling so good... It's turning me so much. Kousei: Nothing wrong with that. Go crazy. Natsume: My body's going numb... I don't know what's happening anymore! Natsume: Ah, ahhhhhh... Don't look! Don't look at my face! Kousei: You look adorable, Natsume. I love you. Kousei: Your insides feel amazing too! Your pussy feels so good... way too good! Natsume: *pant* *pant* *pant* *pant*... I'm so happy... So happy! Kousei: Me too. I love you! I love you, Natsume! Natsume: M-Me too... I love you! This is pure bliss... Ah, ah, ah, ah! Natsume: I l-love you... I love having s-sex with you! Ah, ahhh! Kousei: Natsume... Natsume! Kousei: Natsume, me too! Natsume: Nhh! Cum! Cum inside me! Natsume: Ahh! Ahhhh! I'm cumming... I'm cumming, I'm cumming! Natsume: I'm cumminnngggggg! Natsume: Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Kousei: *pant*... *pant*... Kousei: N-Natsume, I'm gonna cum... I'm gonna cum! Natsume: Do it... H-Hurry... Ahhh... Hurry, hurry! Nghh! Natsume: Ngh, ahh! I'm c-cumming... I'm cumming... Ahhhhhh... I'm cumming! Natsume: Nggghhhhhhhhhh! Kousei: *pant*... *pant*... Natsume: You came... so much... Kousei: I can't move... Feels like my whole body's gone numb... *pant* *pant* *pant*... Natsume: Me too... This felt... way better than I expected... *pant* *pant* *pant*... Kousei: Yeah... I don't think I've ever been this sensitive before. Natsume: Blindfolds are... amazing... *pant*... *pant*... *pant*... Kousei: We should use it again sometime. Natsume: I'll have to think about it. Kousei: Aww. Why do you say that? Natsume: Because... it felt way too good. I was gonna go crazy. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Well, at any rate, you don't have any complaints about it being your White Day gift anymore, right? Natsume: I... guess not. Not anymore. Kousei: Thank goodness. "

I thought you enjoyed the reunion. Natsume: I did. Natsume: It was a relief to find out I wasn't the only one, honestly... After all these years, it feels like a weight's been lifted off my chest. Natsume: So thank you. Kousei: Glad I could help. Natsume: But that still doesn't mean I forgive you for surprising me. Kousei: I thought not. Natsume: I wish you would've just told me you were planning this from the start. Kousei: I did consider it, of course. Kousei: But if I did that, I feel like you would've chickened out. Natsume: Ngh... I guess I can't deny that. Natsume: Actually, come to think of it, didn't you say there were two more people coming to the reunion? Kousei: Well, now that you mention it... Natsume: This better not be another surprise. Kousei: Wait. I really don't know what's happening this time. Kousei: They said they were going to come, I swear. Natsume: Just who else did you invite? Kousei: Err-- Natsume's Father: Natsume. Natsume: Dad? Mom? Natsume's Mother: Hi! Natsume: Don't tell me they were who you were referring to... Natsume's Mother: We were watching you the whole time. Seeing you work, chatting happily with your friends. Natsume's Mother: You looked like you were having so much fun, though, so we didn't want to interrupt. Natsume: ...... Natsume's Father: You had the biggest smile on your face, Natsume. Natsume: I-I was just-- Natsume's Father: It feels like it's been a while since we've seen you smile so brightly. Natsume's Father: Somewhere along the way, we started seeing less and less of that beautiful smile of yours. Natsume's Mother: As you've gotten older, all you've been doing is apologize to us. Natsume: I guess... Kousei: Sorry, I hate to interrupt. Kousei: But why don't we move this conversation inside? No reason to stand around out here. Natsume's Father: Yes, let's do that. Natsume's Mother: I'd love to try some of your tea, Natsume! Natsume: Here is your Darjeeling tea. Natsume's Mother: Thank you. Natsume's Father: Now then, let's give this a try. Natsume: Huh? Wh-What is it? Did I get something wrong? Natsume's Mother: Oh, not at all, dear. Just the opposite, in fact. This is delicious. Natsume's Father: Such wonderful flavor and aroma. This tastes wonderful. Much better than anything I could ever make, at least. You did an amazing job. Natsume: That's ridiculous. You're the one who taught me everything I know, Dad. Natsume's Father: All I taught you were the basics. Natsume's Father: But the tea you're making now goes way beyond \"basic.\" Natsume's Father: You know, when the landlady first told us what you were doing, we had half a mind to stop you... but I feel silly for worrying now. Natsume's Mother: Absolutely. Natsume's Father: Listen, Natsume. There's something we've been meaning to say to you. Natsume's Mother: About this cafe. Natsume: Y-Yes? Natsume's Mother: I'll be blunt. Have you been under the impression that it's your fault that your father and I gave up on the cafe? Natsume: I mean, that's the truth, isn't it? Natsume's Father: It wasn't you. Natsume: But it had to be... Natsume's Father: Sure, we did have to put our plans of opening a cafe on hold. Natsume's Father: But that had nothing to do with your your health, Natsume. Natsume's Mother: Our dream was to quit the white-collar working life and open our own cafe. Natsume's Mother: In fact, we were more than ready to do so. Natsume's Father: But then all of a sudden, the global financial crisis hit. Natsume: Ah... I guess the timing does line up. Natsume's Mother: In other words, given our finances, we just decided it wasn't a very good time to start a new business. Natsume's Mother: Whether you were hospitalized or not, we would have given up on it either way. Natsume's Father: So because of that, we stayed at our jobs. But after a while, our minds began to clear. Natsume's Father: We realized that, truth be told, there wasn't any real need to rush into this cafe thing. Natsume's Mother: Exactly. We decided that we'd take it slow and save up more money. Nothing said we couldn't open the cafe after we retire. Natsume's Father: What we're trying to say is--while it was something we always wanted to do, it was also something we could give up on without hesitation. Natsume's Father: So you have nothing to blame yourself for, Natsume. Besides, we've never regretted our decision at all. Natsume's Mother: If anything, we might've actually regretted opening the cafe back then, instead of giving it more thought. Natsume's Father: Looking back, I'm honestly relieved we didn't act on the spur of the moment. Natsume: Oh... you are? Natsume: I never realized... Natsume: ...... Natsume: *sigh* Great... Then I guess this was all pointless, in the end. Just what have I been doing? Natsume's Father: How is this pointless? You've been working hard to make this dream of yours a reality, haven't you? Natsume: No, you don't understand. This cafe-- Natsume's Father: Is your dream, Natsume. You didn't do all of this for our sake. Natsume's Father: I can tell from the taste of your tea. You've put your heart and soul into this. Natsume's Mother: We understand better than anyone how tough it is running a cafe. Natsume's Mother: If this weren't really your dream, you wouldn't be working this hard. Natsume's Mother: Besides, didn't you see how much fun your guests were having today? Natsume: That's only because... they were my friends. Natsume's Father: Your regular customers enjoy themselves just as much, don't they? Natsume's Mother: Well, of course they do. Otherwise this place wouldn't be so bustling all the time. Natsume: Huh? Wait a second. Have you two been here before? Natsume's Father: Well, of course we have. Although, this is the first time we've ever actually come inside. Natsume's Mother: We were worried about you, so we came to see how you were doing, but one peek was all we needed. Natsume's Father: You were smiling so happily while you worked. Natsume: ...... Natsume's Mother: Opening this cafe may have been our dream, at first. Natsume's Mother: But now, it's yours. Natsume's Father: You made this a reality. Natsume's Father: You're amazing. Honestly, the truth is--we were afraid. That's why we were able to give up on it so easily. Natsume's Mother: While the recession was definitely a factor, in retrospect, we only used it as an excuse. Natsume's Father: But through your own hard work, you've turned this place into the best cafe ever, Natsume. Natsume: I... didn't really... Natsume's Father: As your parents, we couldn't be more proud of what you've achieved. In fact, we even admire you. Natsume's Mother: You worked hard, Natsume. Natsume: I didn't do it on my own, though... Natsume's Father: Maybe, but you managed to succeed at something we never could. Have some more confidence in yourself. Natsume's Father: And please, stop thinking that you need to atone for anything. Natsume's Father: You should be enjoying yourself more, working here. Like you were today. Natsume's Mother: We much prefer seeing you smile, after all. Natsume's Father: And we really are incredibly proud of you. Natsume's Mother: We're couldn't be more glad to have you as our daughter, Natsume. From the bottom of our hearts-- Natsume's Father & Mother: We love you. Natsume: ...... Natsume: Yeah... I know. Natsume: I love you too. Natsume: So? Natsume: How exactly are you going to compensate me for today? Kousei: Well, I'll let you cry into my chest if you want. Natsume: I'm not crying. Kousei: You sure? Looked like you were on the verge of tears earlier. Natsume: Shut up, and give me my compensation already. Kousei: ...... Kousei: I'm sorry. I'm sorry for keeping this a secret from you. I apologize. Please forgive me. Natsume: If you want me to forgive you, then close your eyes. And grit your teeth. Kousei: Okay. Natsume: I can't stay mad at you, after everything that happened. Even if you DID surprise me. Kousei: So you're not breaking up with me, after all? Natsume: I'll let you off the hook. This time. Kousei: Phew. I appreciate it. Natsume: Thank you for today. Really, I mean it. Natsume: I feel a weight's been lifted off my shoulders. Natsume: Knowing that everyone remembered the time we shared together, all those meaningless chats we had when we were kids... It feels good. Kousei: Looks like you weren't so insignificant to them after all. Natsume: I guess not. Kousei: So no more of that self-deprecation, alright? You'll make your parents sad too. Natsume: Yeah, I know. Natsume: Well, at least, now I do. Today, for the first time in my life, I learned just how much my mom and dad care about me. Natsume: Somewhere along the way... I started to think that it would have been better if someone else, someone healthier, had been born instead of me. Natsume: That's why I was always prepared to hear my parents say that about me. Kousei: But that wasn't the case. Natsume: They really do love me, don't they? Kousei: More than you know. Natsume: I thought I was prepared for anything they might say to me. Natsume: But this was... something I wasn't expecting at all. Natsume: Hearing how important I am to them made me really, really happy. Natsume: Yeah. I think it's the fragment of my soul that parted from me... Kousei: You're welcome. Natsume: Thank you for falling in love with me. Natsume: And thank you for being my boyfriend. Kousei: Does this mean I was able become a boyfriend you can be proud of? Natsume: Well, I don't know if I'd go THAT far. Kousei: Is it because of the surprises? Natsume: No. Because other women will start flirting with you if I start bragging about how great you are. Kousei: ...... Kousei: I'll take that as a compliment, I guess. Natsume: It was. Kousei: Ah. Kousei: Well, that's fine. As long as you're happy with me. Natsume: I am. Natsume: To be honest, I've fallen for you all over again. So from now on, I'm going to make sure that I'm the only woman who satisfies you. Kousei: You mean... sexually? Natsume: Well, in that sense too, I suppose. Kousei: ...... Natsume: What? Is that not what you want? Kousei: Oh, no, it is. Just busy imagining all the ways I'll have you \"satisfy\" me later. Natsume: *giggle* You're such an idiot. Natsume: But idiot or not, I still love you. "

Suzune: I'm hoping we get a lot of customers too, but let's not bite off more than we can chew. Suzune: No matter how much we've practiced things, the real deal won't be the same. Kousei: Still, we've reached over 500 followers on Instogram now, so I'd say we've garnered some attention. Mikado: Is that high? Kousei: Well, Hiuchidani-san said it was pretty amazing. It has only been less than a month since we started, and we've only just opened. Mikado: I see. In that case, perhaps we can raise our expectations a little. Kousei: Apparently, our follow count experienced a sudden surge these past few days. Kousei: All thanks to those pictures of you we posted, I'm sure. Mikado: Y-You don't say? Heh. I must say, I did not expect so many people to appreciate my sophistication. Suzune: Even so, our followers could be from anywhere around the globe. There's no guaranteeing they all live in the area. Suzune: If you get yourself too excited, you're just asking to be let down. Kousei: Not very optimistic, are you? Suzune: Ah, sorry. I didn't mean to be a wet blanket. Suzune: I just know how cruel reality can be from personal experience, so I guess I've gotten into the habit of thinking pragmatically. Sorry. Natsume: You don't have to apologize for that. You made a valid point. Natsume: Reality can certainly be unforgiving. But that's why we need to be focused on putting a smile on the face of everyone who walks through our door! Natsume: Once we can do that, people will be lining up outside our cafe in no time at all. Suzune: Yeah, that's exactly what I was trying to say! Kousei: Feels like you're just piggybacking on what she said, though. Suzune: Look, I'm just trying to pep everyone up! Mikado: In any case, both Sumizome-kun and Hiuchidani-kun have classes all morning, so we will be somewhat short-staffed for the time being. Best to keep that in mind. Kousei: Right. The last thing we want to do is inconvenience our customers. Mikado: It is approaching ten now, is it not? Kanna: I'll go flip the door sign to \"Open.\" Natsume: Ah--let me do that. I want to be the one to open the cafe today. Kanna: Of course. By all means. Natsume: *sigh*... We're really open. The day's finally here. Natsume: No, now's not the time to be getting sentimental. This is where the real challenge begins. Let's do this. ???: Finally open, are you? Natsume: Yes! Please, come in! Natsume: We have a customer! Kanna & Suzune & Kousei: Welcome to Cafe Stella! Kazufumi: Oh, it definitely has gotten brighter in here. Both the place and the people. Kazufumi: Hey, guys! I'm here for the big day. Kousei: Welcome. Please, have a seat. Kazufumi: Thanks.

Kousei: I dunno, to be honest. But I'm really happy for some reason. Kousei: What? No! No, I'm not! Not at all! Natsume: ...... Natsume: Are you only with me for sex? Kousei: Of course not. Kousei: But I'm a young man with a healthy sex drive, so, you know... Kousei: Maybe you're just not used to it? That might be why it feels like you're going crazy... Kousei: Once you get used to the stimulation, though, I'm sure you'll be able to keep yourself under control. Natsume: Well-- Natsume: Honestly, it feels like you're trying to trick me.

Natsume: I want to wear something that'll make our customers happy, of course--but this is something I wanted to wear personally. Natsume: Anyway, this was just a little experiment.

I'm being serious here. Kousei: That whole maid cafe shtick honestly wasn't half-bad. Natsume: Then why'd you have such a lukewarm reaction when I did it... Kousei: Well, that's 'cause you wanted me to do it WITH you. Kinda took me out of the moment and made me ask myself what the hell we're doing. Kousei: Still, I can't say I didn't like it. I actually thought it was pretty cute.  Kousei: But then again, I am a guy. Natsume: Yeah, I know. Most of our customers are women anyway. So, with that in mind...

Kousei: I think you were onto something. It had a certain... charm to it. Natsume: No need to spare my feelings. Sorry you had to go along with this silly idea of mine. Kousei: That's okay. I asked you to go to the bar with me, so we're even. Natsume: I know; I haven't forgotten. Still, we probably shouldn't drink on an empty stomach. Why don't we have dinner together first? Kousei: Wait, what? D-Dinner? T-Together? Really? Kousei: I mean, I don't mind. At all. Sure. Yes. I would very much like to. Natsume: Urk. Why are you talking like that? It's honestly gross. Kousei: What do you want? I wasn't expecting a dinner invitation. Of course I sound nervous. Natsume: You're never going to be a chad at this rate, dude. Kousei: Stop bringing that up! Natsume: Well, now we're even. Kousei: Is it really that much fun, humiliating me? Natsume: Pretty fun, yeah. Natsume: Anyway, I'm going to get changed first. Kousei: Alright. I'll wait here. Kousei: ...... Kousei: This... isn't a dinner date. We're just a pair of friends eating together. Totally normal. Natsume: It's kind of a habit. I always go home, take a bath to relax, climb into bed to sleep--then it hits me. Natsume: \"Wait, did I remember to lock the door?\" Kousei: Yeah, I can relate. And once the thought gets into your head, it won't stop nagging at you. "

            "Kousei: Do I really seem that bad? I've still got work after this, though... Hiroto: You're having a hard enough time focusing in class as is. How are you gonna be able to do your job? Natsume: Ah--there you are. Hiroto: Shiki-san? Natsume: Akizuki-san messaged me and wanted me to check up on you. You really aren't looking too good, are you? Kousei: My temperature's fine. I'm not coughing or anything. It's really not a big deal. Hiroto: I mean, you say that... Kousei: I know. I'm not planning to overdo it and pass out either. That'd just cause more trouble for everyone. Kousei: And sorry, but I think I'm gonna take the rest of the day off from work too. Natsume: That's a wise idea. Your face is getting really pale. Kousei: Yeah. I should've just stayed in bed this morning. Kousei: Sorry for all the extra work you guys'll have to do... Natsume: It's fine. It's only a weekday--we'll manage. You should be worrying about yourself first. Hiroto: Want me to walk you home? Kousei: Nah, I can make it on my own. Kousei: I'll head straight home, I promise. I'll message you on Lime when I get back. Kousei: If I REALLY don't feel well, then I'll grab a taxi. Even if it's a waste of money. Natsume: Fine. But you'd better message us, okay? Kousei: I will. Kousei: There. And it's marked read already. Kousei: It's a bit scary being alone when you're sick like this. Kousei: Guess it's only natural to feel helpless when you're sick. Kousei: I should just go to sleep. I need to regain my strength. Kanna: Ah--did I wake you up? I'm so sorry about that. Kousei: That's fine... But what are you doing here? Kanna: I'm here because I was worried about you, of course. Kanna: For the record, I DID message you before I came. You never responded, though. Kousei: My bad. I was asleep. Kousei: Actually... how long was I out? What time is it? Kanna: It's just past six o'clock. Kousei: Wow. I was out for a while... Kousei: Actually... what about the cafe? Do you not need to be back there? Kanna: Everything's fine there. Nozomi-san has taken over for me in the kitchen, and Mei-san also agreed to come into work despite the short notice. Kanna: It's about time for business to start winding down anyway. Kanna: I came to visit you on behalf of everyone else, so there's no need to worry. And if you're wondering how I got in, I borrowed Nozomi-san's key. Kousei: Oh. That makes sense. Kanna: How are you feeling? Kousei: A little bit better. Kousei: Hmm... I suppose? I'm feeling pretty hungry, actually. Kousei: Are you planning to cook for me, by any chance? Kanna: Of course. That's why I dropped by, as a matter of fact. I've already started preparing. Kousei: Thanks. I appreciate it. Kousei: I did buy some frozen udon from the convenience store... but I'd definitely prefer a proper meal. Kanna: I was thinking of making rice porridge with chicken. Would you like me to make something else instead? Kousei: Hmm... Kousei: Since you're offering... Kousei: How about omelet rice? Kousei: I want to eat your omelet rice, Akizuki-san. I've got eggs and ketchup in the fridge if you need it. Kanna: I would certainly make that, if you want... but are you sure that's what you want? Kousei: I'm pretty fond of your omelet rice, to be honest. Kanna: Well... alright then. Kanna: If there's something else you need, let me know anytime. Kousei: Anything? Kanna: Anytime. Kanna: Stop pretending to mishear me as an excuse to make me do something sexual. Kousei: Well, of course I was just pretending. Kousei: I'd obviously never ask you to do anything like that. Kanna: I don't believe you. That was the face of a man who was having extremely perverted thoughts. Kousei: What exactly did you think I was going to make you do? Kanna: Well, you know... when a man and a woman are alone in an apartment together... naturally, they'll... Kanna: ...... Kanna: Oh, how inappropriate! Ngh... Kousei: I don't think I'M the one being inappropriate here. Kanna: At any rate, that's NOT what I meant. Also, if you're going to sleep, you should at least change clothes first! Kousei: Omelet rice is the best comfort food out there, hands-down. Kanna: You know, of all the things you could've requested, I really wasn't expecting you to say you wanted to eat my omelet rice. Kanna: But it made me a little... no, it made me quite happy indeed. Nihihi. Kanna: Alright then. Let me take care of the dishes. You go back to bed, Takamine-san. You look like you still need a bit more rest. Kousei: Yeah... Kousei: I think I'll do that. Thanks, Akizuki-san. Kanna: No problem. *giggle* Kousei: There's one thing I want to ask, though. Kousei: How come you're the one who came to check up on me? Normally, I would've expected Nozomi to volunteer for the job. Kanna: Well... Kousei: She's not the sort of person who likes to leave things to other people. Kousei: Which means there must have been some reason you convinced her to let you come instead, right? Kanna: *sigh*... You're strangely perceptive sometimes. Kousei: So there was a reason? Kanna: At first, I was hoping to ascertain something without you noticing. Kanna: While this is still only a hunch as of right now... there is a possibility that your current symptoms are being caused by a deterioration of your soul. Kousei: A deterioration of my soul? Kousei: Wait. Are you saying my time limit is already up?! Kanna: Please remain calm. This time, it isn't God's judgment you have to fear. Kousei: But if my soul is deteriorating, that means it's getting weaker, right? What could have caused-- Kanna: It's quite possible. Kousei: Judging by what you said earlier, it doesn't sound like you're too sure, though. Kousei: How were you planning to check? Kanna: Well... As a Grim Reaper, I can tell simply by physically touching you, but... Kousei: But? Kanna: It can't just be superficial contact, like a handshake. I won't able to get a clear picture of your soul that way. Kousei: Hmm... So you're saying it has to be some kind of \"deeper\" contact? Kousei: But what does that even mean? Kanna: Well, it means... um... err... Kousei: ...... Kanna: N-No! Of course not! Kousei: But you looked so embarrassed about it, I thought for sure... Kanna: \"Deeper contact\" doesn't refer to depth in the physical sense, as in the depth of a hole... And it certainly doesn't refer to sexual intercourse either. Kousei: Nobody mentioned anything about holes. Kousei: But then what counts as \"deeper contact\"? Like, a kiss? Kanna: Ngh! Kousei: ...... Kousei: What? Kanna: ...... Kousei: What do you think? Kanna: Well, if not... would you be okay... with me being your first? Kousei: I wouldn't... be against it. No. Kanna: ...... Kousei: ...... Kousei: Do we have to kiss, though? Is it absolutely necessary? Kanna: Yes. I'm afraid so. Kousei: Then... I guess we have no choice. Kanna: That's right. We have no choice... Kousei: So, err... what exactly should I do then? Kanna: Well, this is obviously embarrasing for the both of us... so I think it would help if you closed your eyes. Kousei: Alright. Kousei: Err, I thought you said you needed to kiss me? Kanna: I did. Th-That's what I'm doing right now. Kanna: K-Kissing you. With my forehead. Kousei: Huh?! What kinda scam IS this?! Kanna: Excuse you?! This is really embarrassing for me, I'll have you know?! Kousei: Listen. This might be news to you, but a \"kiss\" is something that's normally done using your mouth. Kanna: I'm well aware of that! Kanna: But it's essentially just two people putting their faces together, so this is basically the same thing! Kousei: That's a pretty big leap... Kanna: There's no way I could actually kiss you on the lips! Kanna: That's something strictly done between two people who are romantically involved. And besides, after kissing each other on the mouth, we'd have no choice but to... but have sex... Kanna: Kissing someone on the mouth is, in essence, no different from sexual foreplay! In fact, it'd be no exaggeration to say that it's pretty much the same thing as sex! Do you not agree?! Kousei: No, I most definitely do NOT! Kousei: *sigh* I got my hopes up for nothing... "

Female Student A: The cakes you sell here are really good, aren't they? Female Student B: Which one would you recommend? Natsume: Hmm. How would you like to try one of our strawberry tarts? They're quite popular. Nozomi: Two orders of pancakes, please! Suzune: Coming right up! Suzune: Good to hear. Suzune: Still, it may be time to start thinking up some new recipes. Customers are probably starting to get bored. Nozomi: Are they? It hasn't even been a month since we opened. Suzune: It's great that people are coming from seeing reviews online, but these sorts of customers lose interest fairly easily. Suzune: A lot of them have to travel pretty far just to get here, after all. Suzune: If we want these people to keep coming back, the trick is to offer them something \"limited.\" Something available for a limited time, or in a limited quantity. Nozomi: Ahh, I see what you're saying. I always get tempted to buy things whenever I see limited stuff advertised. Suzune: Right? Kousei: Did you learn that at Patisserie Sourian too? Suzune: Yeah. That's why we always had those in-house baking competitions for new products. Not that mine ever made the cut. Kousei: Oh, right. Because you always ignored the production cost. Suzune: What does that matter as long as it tastes good? Sure, maybe you'd lose out on a bit of profit, but that's a small price to pay to make your customers happy! Kousei: Well, a business is a business. You still gotta make money. Suzune: I know that, geez! I'd never bake something that'd cost the place money to sell. Suzune: I think about profitability too, you know. Sure, maybe I prioritize taste a liiittle too much, but so what? Nozomi: Do you have anything in mind for these new recipes? Suzune: Nothing yet. But, hmm. Maybe an unseasonable Mont Blanc, or an apple tart? A sweet potato pie doesn't sound bad either. Nozomi: Oh, those all sound sooo good! Suzune: Ah, or maybe an apple pie made with whole apples! That'd be cute. Nozomi: Totally! Instogram would LOVE that! Suzune: It's a pretty common dessert, though, so there are probably hundreds of posts already out there under those hashtags. Nozomi: But they're still not sold everywhere, are they? Kousei: That too, but your desserts are something else, Suzune-san. Everything you make looks mouth-watering, to say nothing of the actual taste. Suzune: Heh. Well, you're not wrong. Maybe I'll try baking a small prototype next time? Kousei: ...... Kousei: Hm? Nothing. Nozomi: Oh, okay. Natsume: Akizuki-san. I need an Earl Grey and an Assam tea. Kanna: Alright. I'll get on it. Natsume: I'll heat up the cups for you in the meantime. Kanna: That'd be much appreciated. *giggle* Natsume: What's so funny? Kanna: You seem to be enjoying yourself, Natsume-san. Natsume: Do I? Well, I suppose I am. Natsume: We managed to open the cafe like we wanted, we're getting a ton of customers, and they've all got smiles on their faces too. Kanna: I'm certain we're making a difference in a lot of people's lives. Natsume: I hope so. Kanna: But if only... Natsume: Hm? What is it? Kanna: Oh, nothing. Never mind. Natsume: You're just making me more curious, actually... Suzune: There. All finished. Suzune: We should be good for tomorrow. Let's call it a day. Kousei: You can use the break room first. I'll get changed after. Suzune: You sure? Well, alright then. Good job today. Kousei: You too. Kousei: ...... Kanna: Oh, good! You're still here. Kousei: Akizuki-san? Kanna: Do you think we could sit down somewhere and talk for a bit? Kousei: Right now? It's already pretty late. Kanna: I promise it won't take long. We're not going far. Kousei: Alright... Kousei: I had a feeling you'd bring me up here. Kanna: I'm sorry. I know it's late. Kousei: It's fine. I don't mind, really. Kousei: But it sure looks like you've been busy. That's a lot of butterflies. Kanna: Well, this is my true job. Whenever I'm done with work at the cafe, this is what I do. Kanna: Lately, a number of butterflies have been drawn to our store as well. Kousei: Then I take it your original goal for opening this cafe is going well? Kanna: Yes, thankfully. Kousei: Well, that's good to hear. I thought for sure you were gonna inform me that you'd run into some problem. Kanna: Actually, I kind of have. Kanna: You're feeling stressed out, aren't you, Takamine-san? Kousei: Not really? Kanna: You're lying. Kanna: I've observed all kinds of people during my time as a Grim Reaper; I can tell. I'm not simply asking this for the sake of it. Kanna: What's on your mind? Kanna: Business is going well, and both Suzune-san and Natsume-san seem to be enjoying the work, so it can't be one of those. Kousei: I wouldn't really call it \"stress,\" per se. I do enjoy working at the cafe.  Kousei: Plus our cakes are really popular... and we're getting a lot of customers as well. Kanna: Hmm. Kanna: Oh-ho. I think I've figured it out. You're feeling depressed. Namely, because the customers are only ordering Suzune-san's cakes. Kanna: You don't feel like you're needed. Am I right? Kousei: Pretty much. Kousei: Don't tell me Grim Reapers are telepathic too? Kanna: Hardly. You're just easy to read, Takamine-san. Kousei: Still, it's only thanks to Suzune-san's cakes that we're turning a profit, so I can't exactly complain. Kanna: But customers do order other things. Kousei: Well, yeah. Kanna: And it doesn't seem like you have a lot of downtime in the kitchen either. Or do you want to be really busy? Kousei: No, that's not it. I just can't help but think-- Kousei: If it weren't for the cakes, we'd be losing money. And maybe we should've just made the place a bakery instead. Kanna: I don't blame you for having those thoughts. Kanna: But think about it this way, Takamine-san. Without you, we wouldn't have managed to convince Suzune-san to work with us in the first place, let alone open the cafe. Kousei: I guess... Kanna: What I'm trying to say is, it's too early for you or anyone else to say you aren't needed. Don't be so negative. Kanna: I don't want you doubting yourself, or worse yet, thinking you might as well quit. Kanna: You haven't forgotten the precarious situation you're in, have you? Kousei: ...... Kousei: I had forgotten, actually. Kanna: As I've said before, there's no telling when God will decide to pass judgment on you. Kousei: That's reassuring... Kanna: You've been working hard and putting in an earnest effort, Takamine-san. Kanna: And I'm sure our customers feel that. We just haven't been open for very long, that's all. Kanna: Don't be discouraged. Keep at it, and things will change for the better. There's no need to worry--I know you'll be fine. Kousei: ...... Kanna: Huh? Umm. That's a secret. Kousei: Alright, I'm heading out now. Kanna: Bye. See you tomorrow. Kousei: Bye. Kousei: I mean, I appreciate all that stuff she said... "

Natsume: I think everything's delicious, but in terms of sheer numbers, the strawberry tart is our best-selling item. Natsume: That said, I'd also recommend trying something other than our cakes, like the omelet rice or carbonara. Mature-Looking Student 1: Oh, I read that online too! They say they're pretty good. Mature-Looking Student 3: I'll try ordering one of those next time. Maybe... for lunch? Does it still get packed during lunchtime on weekdays? Natsume: A little bit.

            "Natsume: I think it's time you compensate me for this little surprise of yours. Kousei: Oh, uhh, am I not off the hook? Natsume: Of course you aren't. Kousei: Hold on. I thought you enjoyed the reunion. Natsume: I did. Natsume: It was a relief to find out I wasn't the only one, honestly... After all these years, it feels like a weight's been lifted off my chest. Natsume: So thank you. Kousei: Glad I could help. Natsume: But that still doesn't mean I forgive you for surprising me. Kousei: I thought not. Natsume: I wish you would've just told me you were planning this from the start. Kousei: I did consider it, of course. Kousei: But if I did that, I feel like you would've chickened out. Natsume: Ngh... I guess I can't deny that. Natsume: Actually, come to think of it, didn't you say there were two more people coming to the reunion? Kousei: Well, now that you mention it... Natsume: This better not be another surprise. Kousei: Wait. I really don't know what's happening this time. Kousei: They said they were going to come, I swear. Natsume: Just who else did you invite? Kousei: Err-- Natsume's Father: Natsume. Natsume: Dad? Mom? Natsume's Mother: Hi! Natsume: Don't tell me they were who you were referring to... Natsume's Mother: We were watching you the whole time. Seeing you work, chatting happily with your friends. Natsume's Mother: You looked like you were having so much fun, though, so we didn't want to interrupt. Natsume: ...... Natsume's Father: You had the biggest smile on your face, Natsume. Natsume: I-I was just-- Natsume's Father: It feels like it's been a while since we've seen you smile so brightly. Natsume's Father: Somewhere along the way, we started seeing less and less of that beautiful smile of yours. Natsume's Mother: As you've gotten older, all you've been doing is apologize to us. Natsume: I guess... Kousei: Sorry, I hate to interrupt. Kousei: But why don't we move this conversation inside? No reason to stand around out here. Natsume's Father: Yes, let's do that. Natsume's Mother: I'd love to try some of your tea, Natsume! Natsume: Here is your Darjeeling tea. Natsume's Mother: Thank you. Natsume's Father: Now then, let's give this a try. Natsume: Huh? Wh-What is it? Did I get something wrong? Natsume's Mother: Oh, not at all, dear. Just the opposite, in fact. This is delicious. Natsume's Father: Such wonderful flavor and aroma. This tastes wonderful. Much better than anything I could ever make, at least. You did an amazing job. Natsume: That's ridiculous. You're the one who taught me everything I know, Dad. Natsume's Father: All I taught you were the basics. Natsume's Father: But the tea you're making now goes way beyond \"basic.\" Natsume's Father: You know, when the landlady first told us what you were doing, we had half a mind to stop you... but I feel silly for worrying now. Natsume's Mother: Absolutely. Natsume's Father: Listen, Natsume. There's something we've been meaning to say to you. Natsume's Mother: About this cafe. Natsume: Y-Yes? Natsume's Mother: I'll be blunt. Have you been under the impression that it's your fault that your father and I gave up on the cafe? Natsume: I mean, that's the truth, isn't it? Natsume's Father: It wasn't you. Natsume: But it had to be... Natsume's Father: Sure, we did have to put our plans of opening a cafe on hold. Natsume's Father: But that had nothing to do with your your health, Natsume. Natsume's Mother: Our dream was to quit the white-collar working life and open our own cafe. Natsume's Mother: In fact, we were more than ready to do so. Natsume's Father: But then all of a sudden, the global financial crisis hit. Natsume: Ah... I guess the timing does line up. Natsume's Mother: In other words, given our finances, we just decided it wasn't a very good time to start a new business. Natsume's Mother: Whether you were hospitalized or not, we would have given up on it either way. Natsume's Father: So because of that, we stayed at our jobs. But after a while, our minds began to clear. Natsume's Father: We realized that, truth be told, there wasn't any real need to rush into this cafe thing. Natsume's Mother: Exactly. We decided that we'd take it slow and save up more money. Nothing said we couldn't open the cafe after we retire. Natsume's Father: What we're trying to say is--while it was something we always wanted to do, it was also something we could give up on without hesitation. Natsume's Father: So you have nothing to blame yourself for, Natsume. Besides, we've never regretted our decision at all. Natsume's Mother: If anything, we might've actually regretted opening the cafe back then, instead of giving it more thought. Natsume's Father: Looking back, I'm honestly relieved we didn't act on the spur of the moment. Natsume: Oh... you are? Natsume: I never realized... Natsume: ...... Natsume: *sigh* Great... Then I guess this was all pointless, in the end. Just what have I been doing? Natsume's Father: How is this pointless? You've been working hard to make this dream of yours a reality, haven't you? Natsume: No, you don't understand. This cafe-- Natsume's Father: Is your dream, Natsume. You didn't do all of this for our sake. Natsume's Father: I can tell from the taste of your tea. You've put your heart and soul into this. Natsume's Mother: We understand better than anyone how tough it is running a cafe. Natsume's Mother: If this weren't really your dream, you wouldn't be working this hard. Natsume's Mother: Besides, didn't you see how much fun your guests were having today? Natsume: That's only because... they were my friends. Natsume's Father: Your regular customers enjoy themselves just as much, don't they? Natsume's Mother: Well, of course they do. Otherwise this place wouldn't be so bustling all the time. Natsume: Huh? Wait a second. Have you two been here before? Natsume's Father: Well, of course we have. Although, this is the first time we've ever actually come inside. Natsume's Mother: We were worried about you, so we came to see how you were doing, but one peek was all we needed. Natsume's Father: You were smiling so happily while you worked. Natsume: ...... Natsume's Mother: Opening this cafe may have been our dream, at first. Natsume's Mother: But now, it's yours. Natsume's Father: You made this a reality. Natsume's Father: You're amazing. Honestly, the truth is--we were afraid. That's why we were able to give up on it so easily. Natsume's Mother: While the recession was definitely a factor, in retrospect, we only used it as an excuse. Natsume's Father: But through your own hard work, you've turned this place into the best cafe ever, Natsume. Natsume: I... didn't really... Natsume's Father: As your parents, we couldn't be more proud of what you've achieved. In fact, we even admire you. Natsume's Mother: You worked hard, Natsume. Natsume: I didn't do it on my own, though... Natsume's Father: Maybe, but you managed to succeed at something we never could. Have some more confidence in yourself. Natsume's Father: And please, stop thinking that you need to atone for anything. Natsume's Father: You should be enjoying yourself more, working here. Like you were today. Natsume's Mother: We much prefer seeing you smile, after all. Natsume's Father: And we really are incredibly proud of you. Natsume's Mother: We're couldn't be more glad to have you as our daughter, Natsume. From the bottom of our hearts-- Natsume's Father & Mother: We love you. Natsume: ...... Natsume: Yeah... I know. Natsume: I love you too. Natsume: So? Natsume: How exactly are you going to compensate me for today? Kousei: Well, I'll let you cry into my chest if you want. Natsume: I'm not crying. Kousei: You sure? Looked like you were on the verge of tears earlier. Natsume: Shut up, and give me my compensation already. Kousei: ...... Kousei: I'm sorry. I'm sorry for keeping this a secret from you. I apologize. Please forgive me. Natsume: If you want me to forgive you, then close your eyes. And grit your teeth. Kousei: Okay. Natsume: I can't stay mad at you, after everything that happened. Even if you DID surprise me. Kousei: So you're not breaking up with me, after all? Natsume: I'll let you off the hook. This time. Kousei: Phew. I appreciate it. Natsume: Thank you for today. Really, I mean it. Natsume: I feel a weight's been lifted off my shoulders. Natsume: Knowing that everyone remembered the time we shared together, all those meaningless chats we had when we were kids... It feels good. Kousei: Looks like you weren't so insignificant to them after all. Natsume: I guess not. Kousei: So no more of that self-deprecation, alright? You'll make your parents sad too. Natsume: Yeah, I know. Natsume: Well, at least, now I do. Today, for the first time in my life, I learned just how much my mom and dad care about me. Natsume: Somewhere along the way... I started to think that it would have been better if someone else, someone healthier, had been born instead of me. Natsume: That's why I was always prepared to hear my parents say that about me. Kousei: But that wasn't the case. Natsume: They really do love me, don't they? Kousei: More than you know. Natsume: I thought I was prepared for anything they might say to me. Natsume: But this was... something I wasn't expecting at all. Natsume: Hearing how important I am to them made me really, really happy. Natsume: Yeah. I think it's the fragment of my soul that parted from me... Kousei: You're welcome. Natsume: Thank you for falling in love with me. Natsume: And thank you for being my boyfriend. Kousei: Does this mean I was able become a boyfriend you can be proud of? Natsume: Well, I don't know if I'd go THAT far. Kousei: Is it because of the surprises? Natsume: No. Because other women will start flirting with you if I start bragging about how great you are. Kousei: ...... Kousei: I'll take that as a compliment, I guess. Natsume: It was. Kousei: Ah. Kousei: Well, that's fine. As long as you're happy with me. Natsume: I am. Natsume: To be honest, I've fallen for you all over again. So from now on, I'm going to make sure that I'm the only woman who satisfies you. Kousei: You mean... sexually? Natsume: Well, in that sense too, I suppose. Kousei: ...... Natsume: What? Is that not what you want? Kousei: Oh, no, it is. Just busy imagining all the ways I'll have you \"satisfy\" me later. Natsume: *giggle* You're such an idiot. Natsume: But idiot or not, I still love you. "

            "Kousei: ...... Kousei: Speaking of which, it's almost White Day. Kousei: Thanks for the chocolate cake last time, everyone. Suzune: Speaking of which, we never heard what you thought of it, did we? Kousei: It was really good. Thanks for adding that hint of bitterness to it. Kanna: Nozomi-san told us you preferred it that way. Mei: Suzune-san was pretty much teaching us as we went along, but it really did turn out delicious! Suzune: You were sampling it way too much, though. Mei: Ahaha! Sorry about that. Kousei: Anyway, I wanted to give you guys these baked sweets as thanks. Nozomi: Very well. Nozomi: Wow, you got individual gifts for all of us? Thanks! Suzune: I kinda feel bad since we just gave you one thing from all of us. Kousei: It's fine. I just thought it'd look better if I wrapped everyone's gifts individually. Kousei: But seeing as I had to buy enough for all of you, the portions are a little small. Sorry. Mei: Oh, you don't have to worry about that. This is more than enough. Thank you. Kanna: Absolutely. It's the thought that counts, not the size of the gift. Nozomi: But speaking of size, that big gift you've got there must be for Natsume-san, right? Kousei: Well, yeah. Suzune: Are those baked goods as well? Kousei: Yeah. I also got her some tea leaves, and a couple other small accessories. Stuff like that. Kousei: She tends to dislike holidays that we're socially obliged to celebrate, see. Suzune: I doubt she'd be unhappy with a gift from her boyfriend. Kousei: Well, I hope so. Suzune: Honestly, she'd probably be MORE upset if you arbitrarily decided that she didn't want anything. Kanna: I agree. Mei: You have to be mindful of your girlfriend's feelings. Nozomi: No girl wants to think you've forgotten about her. Kousei: I'll take that advice to heart. Thanks. Natsume: I've got another order for you. A sandwich and a pancake with chocolate sauce, on the double. Kousei: Got it. Kousei: Can you make the sandwich, Suzune-san? Suzune: Sure. I'll get to it once I'm done cooking this. Kousei: Thanks. Kousei: Well, it is White Day. Suzune: Too bad you have to spend the day working, though. Kousei: No way around it, unfortunately. And I can always give Natsume her gift after work. Kousei: The stuff I got her isn't going to spoil anytime soon, so I'm in no rush. Suzune: Then how about this? As long as you keep up the good work, I'll handle the cleanup by myself so you can leave a little early. Kousei: ...... Suzune: What? Too grateful for words? Kousei: No. Just wondering if pigs are going to start flying. Suzune: Haha. Very funny, you little snot. Kousei: I'm just messing with you. No need to take it so seriously. Kousei: But are you sure about this? Suzune: Yeah, why not? It's not gonna kill me. And I'd hate to stand in the way of your relationship. Kousei: Thank you! Suzune: You scratch my back, I scratch yours; that's how it works. Anyway, get back to focusing on that frying pan. Kousei: Yes, ma'am! Nozomi: Order coming in! I need a strawberry pancake and a strawberry parfait, please! Kousei: Coming right up. Kousei: Thanks, boss. I'll leave the rest to you then. Kousei: My bad. I didn't think you were already changing. Natsume: You really need to be more careful. If another girl was changing in here, I would've crushed your eyeballs. Kousei: It's hard to tell if you're joking sometimes. Natsume: Anyway, the others insisted I go home early today. I think they were trying to be considerate of us. Natsume: Same thing happen to you, I assume? Kousei: I wouldn't say \"insisted\". Suzune-san just offered to take care of the cleanup for me. Natsume: Ah. Well, if they're willing to do all of this for us, I guess we might as well accept their kindness. Kousei: Yeah. Kousei: So, listen. I've got something for you, Natsume. Kousei: It's your White Day gift, but, umm... this is my first time giving my girlfriend anything like this. Kousei: So if you aren't happy with it, try not to get TOO upset at me. Natsume: Oh, relax. Don't start making excuses before I've even seen it. Kousei: Sure. Natsume: Let's see... Ohh, sweets. And tea leaves too? Wait, aren't these pretty expensive? Kousei: Well, it's a return gift. Kousei: White Day gifts are supposed to be three times the value of the gift received, right? Natsume: I hear people expect it to be five times, these days. Kousei: Seriously? Talk about greedy... Natsume: Well, some people, anyway. But I don't think an expensive gift necessarily makes for a better gift. Natsume: Rather than spending three times the money, I'd be happier if you spent three times as much time with me instead. Kousei: I'll remember that. Natsume: But that doesn't mean I'm not happy with this gift. Thanks. Natsume: Let's have some of this tea together next time. I'll brew it for you. Kousei: Sounds great. Natsume: Hm? There's something else in here... Natsume: ...... Natsume: What is this? A blindfold? Kousei: A little something extra. Natsume: Ahem. Kousei: I mean, you gave me an extra kiss with your chocolate too, remember? Kousei: And that meant I had to give you something worth three times as much. Kousei: So, after a lot of thinking, I came up with the idea of a blindfold... Do you like it? Natsume: What kind of question is that? Are you stupid? Kousei: Come on! How am I supposed to know what three times a kiss is worth?! Natsume: Well, yes, but a BLINDFOLD? Are you serious? Kousei: Doing it while blindfolded is pretty exciting, though. From what I've read, at least. Natsume: ...... Kousei: Hey, you promised you wouldn't get upset! Come on! Natsume: That's for me to decide, not you, Kousei. Kousei: Sorry. Natsume: *sigh*... Natsume: You really are a pervert. Kousei: ...... Natsume: So? When are we trying it out? Kousei: Wait. Really? Natsume: What? You don't want to? I thought you said it was... pretty exciting? Natsume: Oh, shut it. Kousei: Anyway... how about tonight? Kousei: ...... Kousei: O-Oh, sorry. I spaced out for a second there. Kousei: I gotta ask, though. Uhh, why are you wearing your uniform? Natsume: I thought you'd like it more if I did... Kousei: You must really think I'm some kind of pervert, Natsume. Kousei: I mean, I won't deny I like it. But still. Natsume: I'm starting to get kind of excited too. Kousei: I haven't even done anything yet, though. Natsume: It's pitch black in front of me, I can't see a thing, and my arms are tied too... Kousei: But you like it, don't you? Natsume: Well... I guess I do. Kousei: Natsume... Natsume: Don't worry. I can actually feel my way around... surprisingly easily. Kousei: Nhh... Ah... Natsume: *giggle*... You're already starting to moan. Kousei: Yeah, 'cause I'm ridiculously turned on right now. Natsume: I can see that. In fact... aren't you even bigger than usual? Kousei: I dunno... I can't really tell myself. Natsume: I can't believe seeing your girlfriend like this makes you this big... You really are a hopeless pervert. Kousei: Is it really that noticeable? Natsume: It is... See? Ahmph. Kousei: Ah... Ngh?! Natsume: Nh... My mouth's getting all sticky... Don't tell me you're leaking pre-cum already? Kousei: Y-Yeah... I don't know if I'm actually bigger than usual or not... Kousei: But I am incredibly aroused, I can tell you that much. Natsume: Are you gonna cum soon? Kousei: If I let my guard down, I just might. Natsume: *giggle*... Well, you'd better hold it in. I'm just getting started here. Nhhh... *lick* *lick*... Kousei: *gulp*... Kousei: Ngh! Kousei: You seem... eager. Natsume: Hmm? Do I? *lick*... *slurp* *slurp* *lick*... Kousei: The way you use your tongue... Kousei: Don't tell me you... actually want my cum? Do you... actually think it tastes good? Natsume: What? Please. How could something that smelly and sticky taste good? If anything, it's disgusting. Kousei: O-Oh. Natsume: How about I feed it to you mouth-to-mouth next time so you can see for yourself? Natsume: I never said that. Kousei: Huh? Natsume: It's smelly and goopy, and in a lot of ways, kind of gross. Natsume: But... I never said I hated it. *lick* *lick*... *slurp* *slurp*... *suck* Kousei: Ahh... Ngh... O-Oh. Kousei: In that case... please, keep going. Natsume: Nhh... *kiss* *kiss* *lick* *lick*... Kousei: Ahhh! You sure you've got that blindfold on properly? Natsume: Yeah, I think so... Why? Kousei: Because you're way too precise... Kousei: You shouldn't be able to do this if you can't see, right? Natsume: Of course I can. After all... how many times do you think I've been bullied by this dick of yours? Natsume: I've already memorized its shape... *lick* *lick*... *slurp* *slurp*... Kousei: Ngh, ah... *pant* *pant*... *pant*... Natsume: *giggle*... You're moaning so much. Does it feel that good? *slurp*... Nh... Natsume: Well, too bad... You can't cum yet. Not until I say so... Ahmph. Kousei: Ah, ahh! Natsume: *slurp*... Mhhh... Nhhh! Mhh, mngh... *slurp* *slurp* Kousei: Your mouth is so warm, Natsume... Ngh! Natsume: *slurp* *suck* *suck*... I'll warm you up even more... *slurp* *slurp* *slurp* Kousei: Ngh! Natsume: I don't need to see now that it's in my mouth, do I? Ngh, nhh... *suck* *suck*! Kousei: Still, though... Ngh... This feels even better than usual. Natsume: *slurp*... *slurp* *slurp*... Ahh! *pant*... *pant*... Natsume: Probably because you're turned on more than usual. Kousei: You're not giving me much of a choice! Natsume: You want to shoot out your thick, sticky loads, don't you? Ahmph... *slurp* *slurp* *suck* *suck* *suck*! Kousei: Ngh, ahh... If you suck that hard... Natsume: You can't cum yet, okay? Not yet... *suck*... *suck* *suck* *suck*! Kousei: Then please, slow down a little! Natsume: *giggle*... You're twitching so happily, though. But it doesn't matter how much you struggle... you're not getting away. Natsume: Nh... *suck* *suck* *slurp*... *suck* suck* *slurp*... Nghh! Kousei: Ahhhh! You're sucking so hard! Natsume: Nhh... Nhh *slurp*... *suck* *suck* *suck*... *slurp* *slurp* Kousei: Natsume, that... that feels amazing... And your expression too... It's so lewd... Natsume: *suck* *suck*... Nhhh... *lick* *lick* *lick*... Natsume: Shut up... You can't even see my face with this blindfold on... *slurp* *suck* Kousei: Even with the blindfold, I can tell how excited you're getting. Kousei: You're enjoying this, aren't you? Natsume: *suck* *suck*... *suck* *suck* *slurp*... Natsume: This lewd taste and smell... it's getting even thicker... Mghh... Nh, nhhh... Nhh! Kousei: Ahhhhh?! Kousei: Natsume, that... A-Ahh... If you suck me like that, I'm gonna--! Natsume: Nhh... Nh, nhh... *suck* *suck* *slurp* *slurp*! Kousei: Wait! Ahh! Kousei: You say that, but... Ahh, I can't! Natsume: *suck* *suck* Fine... You can cum. I want you to cum... Shoot out your hot, sticky stuff... *slurp*... Kousei: Ahh, Natsume! I'm gonna cum... I can't hold it anymore! Natsume: Mhhh? Nh... Nh... *suck*! Kousei: W-Wait, let go! If you don't let go I'm gonna--! Natsume: It's fine, do it... I'll swallow it for you again... Mhhhh *suck*! Kousei: You said it was... Ngh... Gross, didn't you? Don't... Ah... Force yourself... Natsume: I'm not... I'll swallow it... I wanna drink... your freshly-squeezed cum... Can't I? Kousei: N-Natsume! Kousei: A-Ahh!

Ahh! *pant* *pant*... *pant*... Natsume: Well, if you put it that way... Fine... *lick* *smack* *slurp*... *lick* *lick*... Kousei: Ah, right there... That's the spot...

I'm the only one who's been feeling good so far. Now it's my turn to return the favor--three times as much. Natsume: What are you--? Kousei: C'mon... Up you go. Natsume: Huh? A-Ahh, wait! Kousei: Here we--go! Natsume: Ahhh?! Kousei: ...... Natsume: What? Why aren't you saying anything? Stop it, you're making me nervous... Kousei: Your boobs are crazy soft... Natsume: Nhh, ah... W-Well... They are natural... Kousei: There is one spot... that's rather hard, though. Natsume: Ahh! Ah, ah... Nhh... Not my nipples... *pant*... Ahh... Nghh... Natsume: Why is it so thrilling... being touched like this? Kousei: I love you, Natsume... Natsume: Nh, nhh?! Don't whisper in my ear like that... You're making my heart race... *pant* *pant* *pant*... Kousei: You're even hornier than usual today. Natsume: That's because... the blindfold... It's getting me so excited... Kousei: Are you that eager to do it already? Kousei: You like it, don't you? Natsume: Ahh?! Nhh, nh, nhh... Hngh! Kousei: You're already so hot and wet down here. Natsume: Because... Ah, ahh, ngh... Ngh... *pant* Ahh... Ahhh! Natsume: Don't tease me like this... *pant*... *pant*... *pant*... *pant*... Kousei: You gotta let me recover. I just came a little while ago, you know... Kousei: *pant*... *pant*... I'm sorry, Natsume. Natsume: Huh? What are you--? Kousei: I can't hold back any longer. Natsume: Ahhh?! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh! Ngghhh! Kousei: I wanted to surprise you. The truth is, I wanted to keep teasing you some more... Kousei: But you just looked so sexy, I couldn't help myself. Kousei: Are you mad? Natsume: Ah, ahhh... Nh, nhh... I don't like it when you lie... but I'm not mad. Natsume: Ahhhhhhh... Your dick... is finally... *pant* *pant*... *pant*... Kousei: Does it really make things that different? Natsume: It feels like... my other senses are becoming more sensitive... since I can't see... Kousei: Ngh... That feels good. Kousei: The way your pussy wraps around me... Natsume: I can feel your dick so clearly... bucking around inside me... Ah! Ah, ah, ah, ahhhhh! Natsume: Nhh, ahh! It feels so good... I'm going crazy! Kousei: Me too... It's like I'm losing my mind. Natsume: You were already an idiot from the start, though... *pant* *pant* *pant*... Kousei: Oh, yeah? I'm gonna make you regret saying--that! Natsume: Nhh, eek?! Ah, agh... Ahh... Right there! Kousei: Here? Natsume: Ngh, ahh! Y-Yes... I love it when you pound me there! Natsume: Huh? In a bad way? Kousei: No way. It mind-blowing. Natsume: Ah, ah... Ah, ah, ah! If you grind that spot... I'm gonna melt! Natsume: If you keep grinding me there, my heads gonna meeelt! Natsume: Ahh! Ah, ahhhh... You're digging so deep... Nhh! Kousei: I love you... I love you, Natsume... I love you, I love you, I love you... Natsume: Ah, ah, ah! Don't whisper like that... It tickles! Natsume: But... it makes me so happy... It's making me feel even better... Ah, ahh, ahhhhhhh! Kousei: Your tits are so soft... and your moans are so lewd... I love how cute you are. Natsume: Ahhhhh... I'm so happy... Ah, ah, ahh... I love you... I love you too! Kousei: Natsume, Natsume! Natsume: Ah! Ah! Ah, ah, ah! That... That feels amaziiiinggg! Natsume: Nooo! I'm really gonna turn into a pervert... If you rub me there, I'm really gonna turn into a pervert! Kousei: *pant* *pant* *pant*... Natsume... Can I take off your blindfold? Natsume: Ahh, *pant*! Wuh? Wh-Why now? Kousei: Because you sound like you're losing your mind. Kousei: I love listening to you moan... but I want to see what kind of expression you're making right now too. Natsume: N-Nooooo... You can't, you can't! Natsume: I'm making a really naughty expression right now! Ah, ahh, ahh... You can't, you can't, you can't! Natsume: Nooo, don't looook... You idiot... Kousei: I love seeing you feeling so good... It's turning me so much. Kousei: Nothing wrong with that. Go crazy. Natsume: My body's going numb... I don't know what's happening anymore! Natsume: Ah, ahhhhhh... Don't look! Don't look at my face! Kousei: You look adorable, Natsume. I love you. Kousei: Your insides feel amazing too! Your pussy feels so good... way too good! Natsume: *pant* *pant* *pant* *pant*... I'm so happy... So happy! Kousei: Me too. I love you! I love you, Natsume! Natsume: M-Me too... I love you! This is pure bliss... Ah, ah, ah, ah! Natsume: I l-love you... I love having s-sex with you! Ah, ahhh! Kousei: Natsume... Natsume! Kousei: Natsume, me too! Natsume: Nhh! Cum! Cum inside me! Natsume: Ahh! Ahhhh! I'm cumming... I'm cumming, I'm cumming! Natsume: I'm cumminnngggggg! Natsume: Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Kousei: *pant*... *pant*... Kousei: N-Natsume, I'm gonna cum... I'm gonna cum! Natsume: Do it... H-Hurry... Ahhh... Hurry, hurry! Nghh! Natsume: Ngh, ahh! I'm c-cumming... I'm cumming... Ahhhhhh... I'm cumming! Natsume: Nggghhhhhhhhhh! Kousei: *pant*... *pant*... Natsume: You came... so much... Kousei: I can't move... Feels like my whole body's gone numb... *pant* *pant* *pant*... Natsume: Me too... This felt... way better than I expected... *pant* *pant* *pant*... Kousei: Yeah... I don't think I've ever been this sensitive before. Natsume: Blindfolds are... amazing... *pant*... *pant*... *pant*... Kousei: We should use it again sometime. Natsume: I'll have to think about it. Kousei: Aww. Why do you say that? Natsume: Because... it felt way too good. I was gonna go crazy. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Well, at any rate, you don't have any complaints about it being your White Day gift anymore, right? Natsume: I... guess not. Not anymore. Kousei: Thank goodness. "

            "Suzune: Tell me your number and ID and stuff. Kanna: Oh! Yes, of course! Will you tell me yours as well, Natsume-san? Natsume: Ah. Sure. Suzune: By the way, we were just talking about having dinner together... Are you coming with us, Natsume-san? Natsume: Well, I'm not going to say no. Suzune: Great. Mei: Then let's get a move on! I'm starving. Kanna: Where should we go? Nozomi: Is there anything in particular you guys want to eat? Natsume: Well... I could go for some yakiniku, personally... Mei: Yakiniku? I wouldn't have expected that from you... Nozomi: Why yakiniku? Natsume: Well, you know. It feels kind of weird going to eat yakiniku by yourself. Suzune: I feel you. I don't mind eating ramen and stuff on my own, but it's a different story when it comes to noisy places like izakayas or yakiniku restaurants. Natsume: Yeah. I've been wanting to eat yakiniku for a while, but just haven't had the opportunity. Nozomi: And grilling yakiniku at home isn't the same at all. Kanna: Men and women... eating yakiniku together... Kanna: ...... Kousei: Are you having dirty thoughts right now? Kanna: No, I'm not! I just don't want you to get any weird misconceptions. Kanna: Just because yakiniku is a stamina food doesn't mean that we're preparing for a roll in the hay tonight, alright? Kousei: That's a pretty old-fashioned notion. Kousei: Besides, that doesn't really make sense considering we're all eating it together. Natsume: Sounds like Takamine-kun isn't the only one who's been a virgin for far too long. Kanna: What is that supposed to mean?! Natsume: Anyway, is everyone fine with yakiniku? Mei: Yep! Nozomi: I could definitely go for some juicy meat! Suzune: Sure, why not. It's been a while since I've had yakiniku. Kanna: Alright. Yakiniku it is! Mei: So which restaurant should we go to? Nozomi: Was there a yakiniku place around here? I don't remember. Suzune: Why don't we just look it up? Somebody's got a spiffy new smartphone she can use. Mei: Ohh, you're right! Mei: Kanna-san! Please do the honors, will you? Put that new phone of yours to use. Kanna: Certainly. But how do I do that? Nozomi: It's easy. All you need to do is open your browser and type in our location plus the word \"yakiniku.\" Kanna: Ah--there are so many results! These are all yakiniku restaurants, aren't they? Kanna: Is there a particular one you want to go to, Natsume-san? Natsume: Huh? Hmm... I'd prefer someplace where we aren't surrounded by too many rowdy drunks. Suzune: For that, we should look for a restaurant with private rooms. Nozomi: Okay, so now add the word \"private room\" into the searchbar. Kanna: Oh, this place looks good. What do you think? Kousei: ...... Mei: Alrighty then. What should we order? How about a nice round of cold ones first? Suzune: I don't think so, kid. Mei: You don't have to be so serious, geez. I was only joking. I'll have an oolong tea. Nozomi: I'll have an oolong tea too. Suzune: Same here. I'll go with something non-alcoholic tonight. Natsume: I'd like something carbonated... Ohh, they have ramune? I haven't had one since I was little. Kousei: I'll go with... green tea, I guess. Suzune: For food, do you mind if I just go ahead and order what I want? Natsume: Sure. Suzune: Then let's start with some beef tongue and beef skirt... Mei: Order some short ribs, please! And some white rice too. Nozomi: You're going all out tonight, Mei-chan. Mei: Well, yeah. It's not everyday we get to eat yakiniku, after all. Gotta indulge myself while I can! Natsume: True. You don't go out to eat yakiniku everyday. Natsume: I think I'd like some short ribs and rice as well. Kanna: ...... Kousei: You've been looking around at everyone for a while now... Something wrong? Kanna: Oh, no. I've just never had a meal with so many people before. Kousei: You haven't? Kanna: No. I've never had many acquaintances, you see. Kousei: Well, what do you think? Kanna: Eating together with a large group is a lot of fun. Kanna: Which reminds me--thank you for helping me buy my smartphone today. Kousei: Sure. Anytime. Kanna: Are you sure you want to be saying that? I might end up dragging you around all over the place now. Kousei: I wouldn't really mind. Kousei: To be honest, I spend a lot of my days off having nothing to do. Kanna: Alright then... I'll ask you again when I need your help with something. Mei: Is there anything you want to eat, Kanna-san? Kanna: Huh? Oh, sorry. Let me see... What is this \"aitchbone\" thing? Suzune: It's meat that comes from the rump of the cow. I think it's a pretty rare cut, actually. Natsume: Why don't we try ordering some to see what it's like? Kanna: That sounds great. One aitchbone please! Kanna: Also, I'd like to take some pictures of our meal. Could you teach me how to use my camera, Mei-san? Mei: Oh, sure thing. Mei: Essentially, all you need to do is launch the camera app. But there's a certain technique to taking mouth-watering photos. Mei: You need to consider the lighting, the angle of your subject... and of course, you've gotta be extra hungry when taking the picture! Kanna: Being hungry makes a difference? Mei: Absolutely! Whenever you're hungry, that burst of excitement you feel when you see food makes everything look more appetizing! Mei: The excitement and enthusiasm is extremely important! Kanna: Okay? Mei: Therefore, your first step should be to order something delicious to eat! Kanna: A-Alright! Store Clerk: Here you are! Kanna: That looks so good! Mei: I know, right? Can't go wrong with grilled short ribs and rice! My signature dish! Kanna: I agree. The way the meat juice and sauces soak into the rice make for wonderful seasoning! Mei: This is what yakiniku is all about! The miraculous union of different flavors! Kanna: The miraculous union... Oh, pictures! I almost forgot! Suzune: It's just grilled meat, but damn is it good. Nozomi: Well, grilling over a net at home is pretty hard. Oh, hey! Don't let it get burnt! Nozomi: Here, Kousei-kun. Kousei: Thanks, Nozomi. Nozomi: Here's some for you too, Natsume-san. Natsume: Thanks, but you should eat too, Sumizome-san. You don't have to serve all of us. Nozomi: I can't help it. I'm too worried about the meat overcooking. Anything less than perfect doneness would be a waste! Nozomi: But don't worry about me. I'm eating as I go along. Natsume: Alright then. Natsume: *sigh*... I'm glad I suggested this. This is delicious. Kousei: These short ribs are great too. So sweet and fatty. Nozomi: The aitchbone is amazing too! Kousei: Are they? Let me try some. Nozomi: Ahh! You stole my precious aitchbone! I was grilling that for me! Suzune: C'mon, don't fight, guys. You can always just cook another one. Nozomi: Which cut of meat is your favorite? Kanna: All of them taste great... but if I had to choose, I'd say I like the beef tongue the best! Mei: Should we order some more for you? Kanna: I'd like to say yes... but I'm not sure I can finish it all. Suzune: Don't worry. We've got a growing young boy with us. Worst comes to worst, you can just have him eat all your leftovers. Kousei: What?! Natsume: Why haven't you been eating anything, Takamine-kun? Kousei: Excuse you?! I have! Natsume: If you want to be a chad, then you need to learn how to go with the flow. Roll with the punches. Kousei: That's not fair! This is peer pressure! Nozomi: Excuse me! Can we get two more orders of beef tongue and beef skirt please? Thank you! Kousei: Hey, wait--TWO orders?! Natsume: Let's go, Takamine-kun! Show us what you're made of! Kanna & Nozomi & Mei & Suzune: When you say tongue, we say skirt! Tongue♪ Skirt♪ Tongue♪ Skirt♪ Kousei: How are you guys in perfect sync?! Did you practice this beforehand?! Nozomi: It's just a joke, you silly. We're gonna eat some too obviously. Mei: Yeah, don't worry. I've still got a bit of room left in my stomach as well. Natsume: I won't lie. I'm nearing my limit... but I guess I can have a couple more slices. Suzune: Two orders will be more than enough for everyone. Kousei: Well, fine. As long as you didn't order it just for laughs. Kanna: *giggle* Kousei: What? Kanna: Nothing. I'm just having so much fun. Kanna: I'm glad I decided to go out and buy a phone today. Kousei: Good to hear. Mei: Oh, that reminds me! Kanna-san, you should install Slow on your phone! It's really fun! Kanna: What's that? Nozomi: It's an app that lets you edit and decorate your photos. Nozomi: We used it to add stamps and stuff to those pictures we took last time. Give it a try and you'll remember. Mei: Come on, get in the picture with us, Natsume-senpai. Natsume: N-No, I'm fine. Mei: Oh, don't be a party pooper. Nozomi: Get Suzune-san in the frame too! Suzune: Well, I guess we don't have much else to do until our food arrives. Mei: You ready, Kanna-san? Kanna: Ready! Here I go, everyone! Kanna: Say cheese! Kanna: That was delicious. Thank you so much. Kousei: Don't mention it. Suzune: Are you sure you don't want us to pay? Natsume: We could've, if you wanted us to. Kousei: It's fine. That was the deal from the start. Kousei: Then how about this? The next time we do something like this, you can pay for my food. Kousei: If you paid me back right now, Nozomi and Hiuchidani-san would feel like they'd have to pay me back as well, so let's just leave it at that. Natsume: Well... Alright, fine. Suzune: Sounds good to me. There's nothing more delicious than free yakiniku. Suzune: But I'll pay you back with something too, next time I get the chance. Kousei: Whatever you want. I don't mind either way. Mei: Now that that's settled, I guess it's time for us to skeedadle, huh? Nozomi: Yeah. Everyone: Thanks for dinner! Kousei: Phew... That hit the spot. Kousei: I've gone to eat yakiniku with Hiroto and some of our other friends before, but we always do all-you-can-eat. Kousei: It's nice to taste some quality meat once in a while. Kousei: Also... Kousei: A thank you text from Akizuki-san... She needs to learn how to separate her sentences, though. And she used the wrong kanji for my name too. Kanna: \"You should not overly focus on other people's mistakes.\" Kanna: \"In that case, can we keep talking for a little while longer?\" Kanna: *sigh*... Mikado: What is the matter? You have been grinning at your phone for a while now. Kanna: It's nothing, really. I was just thinking about how convenient these things are. Kanna: It's amazing how you're able to message people in real time like this. Kanna: Oh, and I forgot to tell you. We went to eat yakiniku today. Everyone had a lot of fun, and we took a ton of pictures too. Kanna: Take a look! See how well they came out? Mikado: You certainly seem to be enjoying yourself. Kanna: Well, I've never been able to make friends, let alone make memories with them. Kanna: It's much more wonderful than I imagined. Mikado: That is all well and good, Kanna, but... Kanna: Yes? Is something wrong? Kanna: Ah--I'm sorry! I got so wrapped up in talking about my phone that I forgot about your dinner, didn't I? I'll get your kibble ready right away. Mikado: Tch. Kibble again? I wouldn't mind something a little more flavorful from time to ti--no, that's not the issue. Mikado: ...... Mikado: Never mind. Forget it. Just give me the kibble. Kanna: Would you like me to season it for you as well? Mikado: Yes, please. Kanna: Rest assured, I haven't forgotten about our original goal. Kanna: My duty is to save Takamine-san's soul, and I won't neglect it. Mikado: Alright... Very well. I trust you. Kanna: Thank you. Kanna: Okay... Is this enough kibble for you? Kanna: Ah--Takamine-san responded! Mikado: We still have work tomorrow, so try not to stay up too late. Kanna: I know, I know. "

Feeling you inside me... is getting me all hot and needy... *pant* *pant* *pant*... Natsume: Yet you still won't start moving... It's not fair. If you leave me like this, I'm gonna go crazy... Nghh... Kousei: I'm gonna go crazy too if I start moving. Natsume: Fine. Then I'll just have to do it myself... Nh, nhh, nhh! Kousei: H-Hey, wait--! Kousei: Natsume... Ahhhh... Kousei: Huh? S-Something wrong? Natsume: It doesn't feel good, either... Kousei: Huh? What does that mean? Natsume: Like I said, it feels good, but... compared to last time... it's not enough... Natsume: Nhh, *pant* *pant*... Geez, what's wrong with me? Nh, nhh... Natsume: Why am I turning so dirty? I don't like this... Kousei: That's not true at all. Natsume: Really? Kousei: Really. You're adorable, Natsume. Natsume: Do you love me? Kousei: Of course I do. Natsume: Then please... Do it... Do it like before. Please? Hurry... Hurry! Ngh, don't keep me waiting! Kousei: That's fine by me. Turn as dirty as you want. Kousei: In fact... I'll make you even dirtier. Natsume: Oh God! *pant* *pant*... I'm gonna turn into a pervert! Kousei: Does it really feel that different from before? Natsume: Mhm! It feels completely different... Eek, ngh... Ahhhhh! Natsume: Every time you thrust inside, it's like my brain's going numb... This feels so much better... Kousei: This... Natsume: Nh, ahh?! Ahh, ah, ah, ahh, ahhhhhh! Kousei: Th-That! Whenever you tighten up like that! Natsume: I don't... I don't know what you're talking about! My body's doing it on its own... Hghh! Kousei: Ngh, that! What you did just now! Natsume: Nghhh! Nhh, ah, ahh! I don't know what's happening anymore... It feels too good! Natsume: I'm sorry! I'm sorry I'm the only one feeling good! Kousei: Don't worry, you're not. It feels amazing for me too. Natsume: But--but... Ahh! I want to be the one making you feel good... God, it feels too good! Kousei: Your pussy's already making me feel incredible, Natsume. Natsume: Your dick too... It's making me... Ahh! Ohh... Nhh! Natsume: Ah, ah, ah! My head's turning to mush! Natsume: Why does it feel so good?! Ah, ah, ah, ah, aah, ahhhhhh! Kousei: You really are a dirty girl, Natsume. Natsume: But you still love me, don't you? Even if I'm this dirty... you said you'd love me, didn't you? Kousei: I did. I love you, Natsume. Natsume: I love you too! No matter how dirty, or how perverted... Ah, ah, ah! I love you! Kousei: Sorry, but it feels too good to stop! Natsume: Ngh, nhhh! Me too! I love you... I love you, I love you, I love you! Natsume: Yes, please! Do it... Cum for me again! Shoot it all out! Kousei: Yeah, I'm gonna cum... I wanna cum inside you... Natsume: That's fine! Do it! Kousei: Ngh! Natsume: Ahhh! Ah! I'm cumming... Ahh! I'm cumming too! Ah, ah, ah, ah! Natsume: Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Kousei: I'm c-cumming... I'm gonna cum! Natsume: *pant* *pant* *pant*... D-Do it! Cum! Hurry... Hurry, hurry... Nghsh! Natsume: I promised! I promised I'd make you cum again, but... at this rate, I'm... I'm gonna--! Kousei: Natsume! Natsume: Ahh! Ah, ah, ah, ah! Nhh, nggghhhhh! Natsume: Nhhh, ahhhhhhhhhhhh! Natsume: *pant* *pant*... *pant*... You let out so much... Kousei: That's just how amazing it felt. Natsume: It's a good thing... we're only doing this event once a week... *pant* *pant*... Kousei: Why's that? Natsume: Because it's going to take a while to get all these stains cleaned out. Kousei: That's true. Natsume: *pant*... *pant*... I can't believe how dirty I've become... I'm almost scared of what'll happen to me from now on. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Just \"scared\"? Natsume: Scared... but happy too. Kousei: Me too. Natsume: Ahh! *pant*... *pant*... Feels like there's no going back for me now. Kousei: That's totally fine by me. Natsume: Well... so be it. Kiss me some more then. Kousei: You got it. Kousei: *kiss* *kiss* *smooch* Natsume: Mhh, *smooch*... *kiss* *kiss*... Mhh, mhhh! "

Kousei: Good morning. Suzune: Morning. Kousei: Any orders I can do? Suzune: Wanna take care of some pancakes for me? They're the deluxe strawberry version. Kousei: Sure. Natsume: How did your finals go? Kousei: I did pretty well, I think. I doubt I got all A's, but I'm confident I got some solid B's. Natsume: Ah. That's good. Kousei: And now that I've passed my exams--I think it's time for my reward. Natsume: ...... Kousei: Hey now. You'd better not have forgotten about our promise. Natsume: I haven't. But this is hardly the place to discuss it... Idiot. Natsume: Just fine. Kousei: Great. Why don't we go on a date to celebrate? Natsume: ...... Kousei: I don't mean THAT kind of date. Just a regular one. Kousei: There's a place I've been wanting to go visit with you for a while now. Kousei: Wanna go there tomorrow? Kousei: Come to think of it, we haven't even gone on a proper date yet. Natsume: Yeah, we haven't... but are you sure that's the only reason you're asking me out? Kousei: Honestly, no. Kousei: But I'm not lying when I say I want to go on a date with you. As for the \"reward\" you promised me, well, I'll leave that up to you. Kousei: It doesn't have to be tomorrow. I'll try my best to be patient. Natsume: Fine. Kousei: That being said, I don't think I can wait very long either. Natsume: I know that too. Kousei: So we're set for our date tomorrow? Natsume: Well, sure. I want to go on a date too. In fact... I'm really happy you asked. Kousei: Great. Kousei: Nope. Not at all. Natsume: Pfft... I never thought I'd get the chance to say something so cliche. Kousei: Me neither. Natsume: You said you had somewhere in mind. Kousei: You'll see when we get there. Think of it as a surprise. Natsume: Well, alright. Kousei: We're gonna take the train, so let's get going. Natsume: Okay. Kousei: Wh-What's wrong? Natsume: Hm? Nothing. Kousei: Okay? Maid: Please, follow me to your seats. Maid: Once you've decided on your order, please ring me over with this bell. Kousei: Thanks. Kousei: Alright. I think I'll start with a Darjeeling. Kousei: What about you, Natsume? Natsume: Kandy... Kousei: You got it. Kousei: We'd like a Darjeeling tea and a Kandy tea, please. Maid: Certainly. Kousei: You don't seem too happy. Kousei: This place has a pretty good reputation, actually. And the prices are reasonable too. Natsume: I never said the service here was bad. And I'm not saying we should've gone somewhere more expensive either. Natsume: But would you normally come here for a first date? Would you normally bring your girlfriend with you to a maid cafe? Kousei: Well, maybe not normally, no. Kousei: In fact, I doubt I'd have ever come here if it weren't for our date today. Natsume: How exactly were you expecting me to react to this? Kousei: Come on. Let's just try and enjoy ourselves. Kousei: Can you do that for me? Natsume: Well, I guess there's no point in complaining now that we're already inside. Kousei: I've heard a lot of good things about the tea here too. Natsume: Hmm. Alright, fine. I'll try to enjoy myself. *sigh*... Kousei: Hmm. I agree. Kousei: Very aromatic. A little astringent--but not too strong. Kousei: Honestly, this might even be better than the tea we serve at our cafe. It's obviously miles ahead of the bottled stuff. Natsume: It's ultimately a matter of taste, so it's hard to say for certain. Natsume: But I think the people who prefer to come somewhere and savor a cup of tea by itself would probably like this place more. Kousei: True. Most of our customers usually only order tea with cake, or some other sweets. Natsume: It really does smell amazing. I shouldn't have underestimated maid cafes. I thought they all relied on the moe factor. Kousei: I'm glad you like it. Kousei: See? These sort of quiet, relaxing places aren't half bad. Natsume: Well, it's not bad, I'll admit. Kousei: Then what do you say we try something similar? Natsume: What do you mean? Kousei: I'm talking about your maid outfit. You were looking for an excuse to wear it, weren't you? Kousei: So why don't we try doing an authentic maid cafe experience ourselves? None of that \"moe moe kyun!\" stuff, like last time. Natsume: You still remember that? Kousei: Of course I do. Kousei: It's something you've always dreamed of, no? Those uniforms in that picture you drew as a kid. Natsume: ...... Kousei: I love you, Natsume. What I want most is to see you smile. Kousei: And that's why I want to make your dreams come true. Kousei: As your boyfriend, seeing you smile makes me smile. Natsume: I appreciate that and all, but still... Kousei: I'm not suggesting we overhaul the entire cafe, obviously. Kousei: But maybe we can offer a special \"maid service\" during certain times or certain days of the week? Y'know, like a traditional afternoon tea. Kousei: At the very least, it can't hurt to try. Kousei: Suzune-san's cakes are selling great, and our coffee and tea are getting pretty decent sales too. Kousei: I don't think our female customers would mind the quieter atmosphere either. You said it yourself; you don't mind it. Natsume: Maybe not, but I'm not sure we should be promoting Cafe Stella as a maid cafe. Natsume: Regardless of whether or not we are, it might give people the wrong idea about us... Kousei: That's where Mikado comes in. Kousei: We'll get him to play the role of a butler. Kousei: That way, it'll make the whole \"afternoon tea\" thing seem more authentic. Plus, I bet it'll make him even more popular with the neighborhood housewives. Kousei: I think people would like it. He'd make for a very handsome butler. Natsume: Well, I suppose it'd appeal to our current, existing customer base... Kousei: Of course, there's no telling how they'll react until we try it, but I think it's worth a shot. Kousei: Don't you want to see your drawing become a reality? Natsume: How long have you been thinking about this, by the way? Kousei: Since the stall on New Year's. When people started associating your qipao with authentic Chinese flavor. Kousei: That's why I brought you here today. Kousei: It's not because I have a thing for maids or anything. Natsume: Sorry. I totally misunderstood. Kousei: Yeah, you were giving me a real stink-eye. Natsume: Can you blame me? Imagine suddenly finding yourself at a maid cafe on your first date. Kousei: I was just hoping to surprise you a little. Natsume: I don't like surprises. Natsume: If you start hiring flash mobs or something ridiculous like that, I'm breaking up with you on the spot. Kousei: Duly noted. Kousei: Still, though... you do like the place, don't you? Natsume: Well... I guess. I just wish you would've said something beforehand. Kousei: Sorry. Natsume: But knowing how much thought you've put into this for my sake makes me really happy. Kousei: So let's put our all into this, together. Natsume: Yeah. Thanks. Kousei: Actually, I was a little too preoccupied with discussing the maid thing today that I didn't really plan anything else... Sorry! Kousei: How about we go with the standard date? Kousei: See a movie, go window shopping. That sorta thing. Natsume: Sure. That's fine with me. Kousei: (Still... Hmm... Mgh....) Natsume: What? Stop sneaking peeks at me like that. It's creepy. Kousei: Wow. That hurts, you know? Natsume: Well? Are you going to tell me what's on your mind, or not? Kousei: I was just... wondering if it was okay to hold your hand. Y'know, whether or not it was the right time to. Natsume: That's what got you so nervous? Kousei: I know, but I can't do anything about it. Kousei: I'm too scared of you rejecting me. Natsume: If I didn't want to hold your hand, I wouldn't have come on this date. Or I would've left halfway through. That's the type of person I am. Natsume: You don't need to be scared of anything, I promise. Kousei: Well, in that case... Kousei: Err, I hope I'm not wrong about this. That'd be... pretty awkward. Kousei: Sorry I made you wait. Natsume: You better be. My fingers were about to freeze. Kousei: Sorry. I mean it. Natsume: Well, as long as you warm them up, I'll let you off. "

Female Student A: The cakes you sell here are really good, aren't they? Female Student B: Which one would you recommend? Natsume: Hmm. How would you like to try one of our strawberry tarts? They're quite popular. Nozomi: Two orders of pancakes, please! Suzune: Coming right up! Suzune: Good to hear. Suzune: Still, it may be time to start thinking up some new recipes. Customers are probably starting to get bored. Nozomi: Are they? It hasn't even been a month since we opened. Suzune: It's great that people are coming from seeing reviews online, but these sorts of customers lose interest fairly easily. Suzune: A lot of them have to travel pretty far just to get here, after all. Suzune: If we want these people to keep coming back, the trick is to offer them something \"limited.\" Something available for a limited time, or in a limited quantity. Nozomi: Ahh, I see what you're saying. I always get tempted to buy things whenever I see limited stuff advertised. Suzune: Right? Kousei: Did you learn that at Patisserie Sourian too? Suzune: Yeah. That's why we always had those in-house baking competitions for new products. Not that mine ever made the cut. Kousei: Oh, right. Because you always ignored the production cost. Suzune: What does that matter as long as it tastes good? Sure, maybe you'd lose out on a bit of profit, but that's a small price to pay to make your customers happy! Kousei: Well, a business is a business. You still gotta make money. Suzune: I know that, geez! I'd never bake something that'd cost the place money to sell. Suzune: I think about profitability too, you know. Sure, maybe I prioritize taste a liiittle too much, but so what? Nozomi: Do you have anything in mind for these new recipes? Suzune: Nothing yet. But, hmm. Maybe an unseasonable Mont Blanc, or an apple tart? A sweet potato pie doesn't sound bad either. Nozomi: Oh, those all sound sooo good! Suzune: Ah, or maybe an apple pie made with whole apples! That'd be cute. Nozomi: Totally! Instogram would LOVE that! Suzune: It's a pretty common dessert, though, so there are probably hundreds of posts already out there under those hashtags. Nozomi: But they're still not sold everywhere, are they? Kousei: That too, but your desserts are something else, Suzune-san. Everything you make looks mouth-watering, to say nothing of the actual taste. Suzune: Heh. Well, you're not wrong. Maybe I'll try baking a small prototype next time? Kousei: ...... Kousei: Hm? Nothing. Nozomi: Oh, okay. Natsume: Akizuki-san. I need an Earl Grey and an Assam tea. Kanna: Alright. I'll get on it. Natsume: I'll heat up the cups for you in the meantime. Kanna: That'd be much appreciated. *giggle* Natsume: What's so funny? Kanna: You seem to be enjoying yourself, Natsume-san. Natsume: Do I? Well, I suppose I am. Natsume: We managed to open the cafe like we wanted, we're getting a ton of customers, and they've all got smiles on their faces too. Kanna: I'm certain we're making a difference in a lot of people's lives. Natsume: I hope so. Kanna: But if only... Natsume: Hm? What is it? Kanna: Oh, nothing. Never mind. Natsume: You're just making me more curious, actually... Suzune: There. All finished. Suzune: We should be good for tomorrow. Let's call it a day. Kousei: You can use the break room first. I'll get changed after. Suzune: You sure? Well, alright then. Good job today. Kousei: You too. Kousei: ...... Kanna: Oh, good! You're still here. Kousei: Akizuki-san? Kanna: Do you think we could sit down somewhere and talk for a bit? Kousei: Right now? It's already pretty late. Kanna: I promise it won't take long. We're not going far. Kousei: Alright... Kousei: I had a feeling you'd bring me up here. Kanna: I'm sorry. I know it's late. Kousei: It's fine. I don't mind, really. Kousei: But it sure looks like you've been busy. That's a lot of butterflies. Kanna: Well, this is my true job. Whenever I'm done with work at the cafe, this is what I do. Kanna: Lately, a number of butterflies have been drawn to our store as well. Kousei: Then I take it your original goal for opening this cafe is going well? Kanna: Yes, thankfully. Kousei: Well, that's good to hear. I thought for sure you were gonna inform me that you'd run into some problem. Kanna: Actually, I kind of have. Kanna: You're feeling stressed out, aren't you, Takamine-san? Kousei: Not really? Kanna: You're lying. Kanna: I've observed all kinds of people during my time as a Grim Reaper; I can tell. I'm not simply asking this for the sake of it. Kanna: What's on your mind? Kanna: Business is going well, and both Suzune-san and Natsume-san seem to be enjoying the work, so it can't be one of those. Kousei: I wouldn't really call it \"stress,\" per se. I do enjoy working at the cafe.  Kousei: Plus our cakes are really popular... and we're getting a lot of customers as well. Kanna: Hmm. Kanna: Oh-ho. I think I've figured it out. You're feeling depressed. Namely, because the customers are only ordering Suzune-san's cakes. Kanna: You don't feel like you're needed. Am I right? Kousei: Pretty much. Kousei: Don't tell me Grim Reapers are telepathic too? Kanna: Hardly. You're just easy to read, Takamine-san. Kousei: Still, it's only thanks to Suzune-san's cakes that we're turning a profit, so I can't exactly complain. Kanna: But customers do order other things. Kousei: Well, yeah. Kanna: And it doesn't seem like you have a lot of downtime in the kitchen either. Or do you want to be really busy? Kousei: No, that's not it. I just can't help but think-- Kousei: If it weren't for the cakes, we'd be losing money. And maybe we should've just made the place a bakery instead. Kanna: I don't blame you for having those thoughts. Kanna: But think about it this way, Takamine-san. Without you, we wouldn't have managed to convince Suzune-san to work with us in the first place, let alone open the cafe. Kousei: I guess... Kanna: What I'm trying to say is, it's too early for you or anyone else to say you aren't needed. Don't be so negative. Kanna: I don't want you doubting yourself, or worse yet, thinking you might as well quit. Kanna: You haven't forgotten the precarious situation you're in, have you? Kousei: ...... Kousei: I had forgotten, actually. Kanna: As I've said before, there's no telling when God will decide to pass judgment on you. Kousei: That's reassuring... Kanna: You've been working hard and putting in an earnest effort, Takamine-san. Kanna: And I'm sure our customers feel that. We just haven't been open for very long, that's all. Kanna: Don't be discouraged. Keep at it, and things will change for the better. There's no need to worry--I know you'll be fine. Kousei: ...... Kanna: Huh? Umm. That's a secret. Kousei: Alright, I'm heading out now. Kanna: Bye. See you tomorrow. Kousei: Bye. Kousei: I mean, I appreciate all that stuff she said... "

            "Suzune: Tell me your number and ID and stuff. Kanna: Oh! Yes, of course! Will you tell me yours as well, Natsume-san? Natsume: Ah. Sure. Suzune: By the way, we were just talking about having dinner together... Are you coming with us, Natsume-san? Natsume: Well, I'm not going to say no. Suzune: Great. Mei: Then let's get a move on! I'm starving. Kanna: Where should we go? Nozomi: Is there anything in particular you guys want to eat? Natsume: Well... I could go for some yakiniku, personally... Mei: Yakiniku? I wouldn't have expected that from you... Nozomi: Why yakiniku? Natsume: Well, you know. It feels kind of weird going to eat yakiniku by yourself. Suzune: I feel you. I don't mind eating ramen and stuff on my own, but it's a different story when it comes to noisy places like izakayas or yakiniku restaurants. Natsume: Yeah. I've been wanting to eat yakiniku for a while, but just haven't had the opportunity. Nozomi: And grilling yakiniku at home isn't the same at all. Kanna: Men and women... eating yakiniku together... Kanna: ...... Kousei: Are you having dirty thoughts right now? Kanna: No, I'm not! I just don't want you to get any weird misconceptions. Kanna: Just because yakiniku is a stamina food doesn't mean that we're preparing for a roll in the hay tonight, alright? Kousei: That's a pretty old-fashioned notion. Kousei: Besides, that doesn't really make sense considering we're all eating it together. Natsume: Sounds like Takamine-kun isn't the only one who's been a virgin for far too long. Kanna: What is that supposed to mean?! Natsume: Anyway, is everyone fine with yakiniku? Mei: Yep! Nozomi: I could definitely go for some juicy meat! Suzune: Sure, why not. It's been a while since I've had yakiniku. Kanna: Alright. Yakiniku it is! Mei: So which restaurant should we go to? Nozomi: Was there a yakiniku place around here? I don't remember. Suzune: Why don't we just look it up? Somebody's got a spiffy new smartphone she can use. Mei: Ohh, you're right! Mei: Kanna-san! Please do the honors, will you? Put that new phone of yours to use. Kanna: Certainly. But how do I do that? Nozomi: It's easy. All you need to do is open your browser and type in our location plus the word \"yakiniku.\" Kanna: Ah--there are so many results! These are all yakiniku restaurants, aren't they? Kanna: Is there a particular one you want to go to, Natsume-san? Natsume: Huh? Hmm... I'd prefer someplace where we aren't surrounded by too many rowdy drunks. Suzune: For that, we should look for a restaurant with private rooms. Nozomi: Okay, so now add the word \"private room\" into the searchbar. Kanna: Oh, this place looks good. What do you think? Kousei: ...... Mei: Alrighty then. What should we order? How about a nice round of cold ones first? Suzune: I don't think so, kid. Mei: You don't have to be so serious, geez. I was only joking. I'll have an oolong tea. Nozomi: I'll have an oolong tea too. Suzune: Same here. I'll go with something non-alcoholic tonight. Natsume: I'd like something carbonated... Ohh, they have ramune? I haven't had one since I was little. Kousei: I'll go with... green tea, I guess. Suzune: For food, do you mind if I just go ahead and order what I want? Natsume: Sure. Suzune: Then let's start with some beef tongue and beef skirt... Mei: Order some short ribs, please! And some white rice too. Nozomi: You're going all out tonight, Mei-chan. Mei: Well, yeah. It's not everyday we get to eat yakiniku, after all. Gotta indulge myself while I can! Natsume: True. You don't go out to eat yakiniku everyday. Natsume: I think I'd like some short ribs and rice as well. Kanna: ...... Kousei: You've been looking around at everyone for a while now... Something wrong? Kanna: Oh, no. I've just never had a meal with so many people before. Kousei: You haven't? Kanna: No. I've never had many acquaintances, you see. Kousei: Well, what do you think? Kanna: Eating together with a large group is a lot of fun. Kanna: Which reminds me--thank you for helping me buy my smartphone today. Kousei: Sure. Anytime. Kanna: Are you sure you want to be saying that? I might end up dragging you around all over the place now. Kousei: I wouldn't really mind. Kousei: To be honest, I spend a lot of my days off having nothing to do. Kanna: Alright then... I'll ask you again when I need your help with something. Mei: Is there anything you want to eat, Kanna-san? Kanna: Huh? Oh, sorry. Let me see... What is this \"aitchbone\" thing? Suzune: It's meat that comes from the rump of the cow. I think it's a pretty rare cut, actually. Natsume: Why don't we try ordering some to see what it's like? Kanna: That sounds great. One aitchbone please! Kanna: Also, I'd like to take some pictures of our meal. Could you teach me how to use my camera, Mei-san? Mei: Oh, sure thing. Mei: Essentially, all you need to do is launch the camera app. But there's a certain technique to taking mouth-watering photos. Mei: You need to consider the lighting, the angle of your subject... and of course, you've gotta be extra hungry when taking the picture! Kanna: Being hungry makes a difference? Mei: Absolutely! Whenever you're hungry, that burst of excitement you feel when you see food makes everything look more appetizing! Mei: The excitement and enthusiasm is extremely important! Kanna: Okay? Mei: Therefore, your first step should be to order something delicious to eat! Kanna: A-Alright! Store Clerk: Here you are! Kanna: That looks so good! Mei: I know, right? Can't go wrong with grilled short ribs and rice! My signature dish! Kanna: I agree. The way the meat juice and sauces soak into the rice make for wonderful seasoning! Mei: This is what yakiniku is all about! The miraculous union of different flavors! Kanna: The miraculous union... Oh, pictures! I almost forgot! Suzune: It's just grilled meat, but damn is it good. Nozomi: Well, grilling over a net at home is pretty hard. Oh, hey! Don't let it get burnt! Nozomi: Here, Kousei-kun. Kousei: Thanks, Nozomi. Nozomi: Here's some for you too, Natsume-san. Natsume: Thanks, but you should eat too, Sumizome-san. You don't have to serve all of us. Nozomi: I can't help it. I'm too worried about the meat overcooking. Anything less than perfect doneness would be a waste! Nozomi: But don't worry about me. I'm eating as I go along. Natsume: Alright then. Natsume: *sigh*... I'm glad I suggested this. This is delicious. Kousei: These short ribs are great too. So sweet and fatty. Nozomi: The aitchbone is amazing too! Kousei: Are they? Let me try some. Nozomi: Ahh! You stole my precious aitchbone! I was grilling that for me! Suzune: C'mon, don't fight, guys. You can always just cook another one. Nozomi: Which cut of meat is your favorite? Kanna: All of them taste great... but if I had to choose, I'd say I like the beef tongue the best! Mei: Should we order some more for you? Kanna: I'd like to say yes... but I'm not sure I can finish it all. Suzune: Don't worry. We've got a growing young boy with us. Worst comes to worst, you can just have him eat all your leftovers. Kousei: What?! Natsume: Why haven't you been eating anything, Takamine-kun? Kousei: Excuse you?! I have! Natsume: If you want to be a chad, then you need to learn how to go with the flow. Roll with the punches. Kousei: That's not fair! This is peer pressure! Nozomi: Excuse me! Can we get two more orders of beef tongue and beef skirt please? Thank you! Kousei: Hey, wait--TWO orders?! Natsume: Let's go, Takamine-kun! Show us what you're made of! Kanna & Nozomi & Mei & Suzune: When you say tongue, we say skirt! Tongue♪ Skirt♪ Tongue♪ Skirt♪ Kousei: How are you guys in perfect sync?! Did you practice this beforehand?! Nozomi: It's just a joke, you silly. We're gonna eat some too obviously. Mei: Yeah, don't worry. I've still got a bit of room left in my stomach as well. Natsume: I won't lie. I'm nearing my limit... but I guess I can have a couple more slices. Suzune: Two orders will be more than enough for everyone. Kousei: Well, fine. As long as you didn't order it just for laughs. Kanna: *giggle* Kousei: What? Kanna: Nothing. I'm just having so much fun. Kanna: I'm glad I decided to go out and buy a phone today. Kousei: Good to hear. Mei: Oh, that reminds me! Kanna-san, you should install Slow on your phone! It's really fun! Kanna: What's that? Nozomi: It's an app that lets you edit and decorate your photos. Nozomi: We used it to add stamps and stuff to those pictures we took last time. Give it a try and you'll remember. Mei: Come on, get in the picture with us, Natsume-senpai. Natsume: N-No, I'm fine. Mei: Oh, don't be a party pooper. Nozomi: Get Suzune-san in the frame too! Suzune: Well, I guess we don't have much else to do until our food arrives. Mei: You ready, Kanna-san? Kanna: Ready! Here I go, everyone! Kanna: Say cheese! Kanna: That was delicious. Thank you so much. Kousei: Don't mention it. Suzune: Are you sure you don't want us to pay? Natsume: We could've, if you wanted us to. Kousei: It's fine. That was the deal from the start. Kousei: Then how about this? The next time we do something like this, you can pay for my food. Kousei: If you paid me back right now, Nozomi and Hiuchidani-san would feel like they'd have to pay me back as well, so let's just leave it at that. Natsume: Well... Alright, fine. Suzune: Sounds good to me. There's nothing more delicious than free yakiniku. Suzune: But I'll pay you back with something too, next time I get the chance. Kousei: Whatever you want. I don't mind either way. Mei: Now that that's settled, I guess it's time for us to skeedadle, huh? Nozomi: Yeah. Everyone: Thanks for dinner! Kousei: Phew... That hit the spot. Kousei: I've gone to eat yakiniku with Hiroto and some of our other friends before, but we always do all-you-can-eat. Kousei: It's nice to taste some quality meat once in a while. Kousei: Also... Kousei: A thank you text from Akizuki-san... She needs to learn how to separate her sentences, though. And she used the wrong kanji for my name too. Kanna: \"You should not overly focus on other people's mistakes.\" Kanna: \"In that case, can we keep talking for a little while longer?\" Kanna: *sigh*... Mikado: What is the matter? You have been grinning at your phone for a while now. Kanna: It's nothing, really. I was just thinking about how convenient these things are. Kanna: It's amazing how you're able to message people in real time like this. Kanna: Oh, and I forgot to tell you. We went to eat yakiniku today. Everyone had a lot of fun, and we took a ton of pictures too. Kanna: Take a look! See how well they came out? Mikado: You certainly seem to be enjoying yourself. Kanna: Well, I've never been able to make friends, let alone make memories with them. Kanna: It's much more wonderful than I imagined. Mikado: That is all well and good, Kanna, but... Kanna: Yes? Is something wrong? Kanna: Ah--I'm sorry! I got so wrapped up in talking about my phone that I forgot about your dinner, didn't I? I'll get your kibble ready right away. Mikado: Tch. Kibble again? I wouldn't mind something a little more flavorful from time to ti--no, that's not the issue. Mikado: ...... Mikado: Never mind. Forget it. Just give me the kibble. Kanna: Would you like me to season it for you as well? Mikado: Yes, please. Kanna: Rest assured, I haven't forgotten about our original goal. Kanna: My duty is to save Takamine-san's soul, and I won't neglect it. Mikado: Alright... Very well. I trust you. Kanna: Thank you. Kanna: Okay... Is this enough kibble for you? Kanna: Ah--Takamine-san responded! Mikado: We still have work tomorrow, so try not to stay up too late. Kanna: I know, I know. "

            "Kousei: It's going great. Kousei: Your sister's been a huge help. Hiroto: What's she like at work? Kousei: She's working hard and says she enjoys it. Kousei: I think it's safe to say her shut-in days are behind her. Hiroto: Oh, that's great. I'm glad you helped her get off her ass. Hiroto: I'll stop by another time when I get the chance. Kousei: Oh? Did you try asking a girl to come with you? Hiroto: Sure did! I found a girl and asked her out on a date, just like you suggested. Kousei: And what'd she say? Hiroto: She thanked me for the recommendation and said she'd go check it out with someone else. Kousei: W-Well, the cafe is pretty popular with girls, so I'll bet she just wanted to go with a friend. Hiroto: That \"someone else\" was a guy. Kousei: O-Oh... Hiroto: At least I got your cafe's name out there. I guess it was a success in some sense. Kousei: Yeah... Well, lemme know when you're planning to come by. Kousei: I'll cook you something on the house if you come alone. Hiroto: Is that sarcasm? Or are you just rubbing salt in the wound? Kousei: I'm offering my condolences. I know the struggle, man. Hiroto: The hell?! You got some nerve saying that when you get to hang out with a bunch of total babes at work! Hiroto: Hell, I wanna work there too. You guys hiring? Kousei: Err... Kousei: Aren't you too busy with school for a job anyway? Hiroto: Well, you're kind of right. Kousei: Besides, you realize your sister works in the kitchen full-time, right? Hiroto: Ah... Hiroto: Nevermind. Working with her would be hell, actually. Kousei: That's what I thought. Hiroto: I will. If nothing else, my sister's a hell of a baker. I'll probably visit again soon. Hiroto: But Goddammit, I'm gonna find a girl to go with if it's the last thing I do... Kousei: Alright. Back to the cafe now. Natsume: Ah--Takamine-kun. Kousei: Oh, hi, Shiki-san. On your way to class? Natsume: Just finished, actually. I'm on my way to the cafe right now. What about you? Kousei: Me too. Natsume: Oh, then why don't we go together? Kousei: Er... Yeah, sure. Kousei: Sorry. I didn't mean to hesitate there, I just-- Natsume: Yes, yes. I know. You were probably worrying about something stupid like \"What should I say?\" or \"What if it gets awkward?\", right? Kousei: What I meant to say was: please walk with me. Natsume: That's better. Now come on, let's go. Kousei: I'm back. Suzune: Oh. Welcome back. Kousei: How's business today? Getting a lot of orders? Suzune: Pretty quiet at the moment. We were busier at lunch, but I managed to handle it on my own. Kousei: That's good. Suzune: What did I tell you? Fewer people come on weekdays than on weekends. Suzune: Especially since we aren't located in the business district. This'll probably be par for the course for most weekdays. Suzune: But seeing as a lot of local housewives and college kids are coming by, I think it's safe to say we're fairly popular. Kousei: I'm guessing your strawberry tarts are our best sellers? Suzune: Actually, I think today's top seller is the sachertorte. The pancakes are selling pretty well too. Kousei: Well, I'm glad we're not short-staffed. Looks like you've got everything under control. Suzune: You worry too much. Focus on class while you're at school. Kousei: Yeah, I guess. Suzune: Don't use this job as an excuse to push back your graduation, you hear me? Kousei: I know. Suzune: Seriously, though, are you sure you're dedicating enough time to studying? Even Hiroto seems a lot busier with schoolwork than you are. Kousei: That's only because he slacked off so much during his first two years. Kousei: As long as you take enough classes each year, you won't end up having to study your ass off every day like him. Kousei: Anyway, good job holding down the fort. Kousei: Feel free to take a break, if you want. I can take over the kitchen for now. Suzune: Thanks. I guess I'll take you up on that. Kousei: Sure. Kousei: Though if they're just here to buy a cake, that won't be my job either.  Kousei: ...... Mei: Good morning! Kousei: Oh, Hiuchidani-san? Kousei: What are you doing here? I thought you didn't work today. Mei: What do you mean? Don't tell me you forgot. You said you'd make me a cold-brew coffee! Kousei: Oh, right! That! Mei: Okay, well I hope you're ready for that scalding hot coffee! Kousei: Wait, hold up! I didn't forget! I got everything ready. I just forgot I left the beans chilling in the fridge. Mei: It's not going to taste even MORE bitter because you over-chilled them, right? Kousei: Oh, no. I put them in this morning when I was helping prepare the cakes, so this is actually be the perfect time to take them out. Mei: Reeeally? You're not trying to trick me, are you? Kousei: 'Course not. Mei: Good! Because I've been really looking forward to this. Ahaha! Kousei: I'll have it ready soon, so feel free to have a seat outside. Mei: Huh? But I'm not a customer. Kousei: It's fine. There are plenty of open seats. Kousei: Shiki-san's on waitress duty, so if you're that worried, just let her know. Mei: Hmm. Well, alright. If you say so. Kousei: Would you like to order anything else with your cold-brew? Mei: Now that you mention it, I'm hankerin' for some pancakes! Kousei: Yes, ma'am. I'll have those out to you shortly. Mei: Okie doke! Kousei: One cold-brew coffee and some pancakes. Mei: Thanks very much! Mei: Oh, I'm so excited! So this is a cold-brew... Huh. It's darker than I thought it'd be. Kousei: Well, it's still coffee. Mei: But it's not as bitter as the regular kind, right? Kousei: That's what people generally say. Mei: Welp, bottoms up! Mei: *gulp* *gulp*... Hmm. It's still bitter! Mei: Bleh... You screwed it up, Senpai! Kousei: There's no way. I tasted it myself beforehand. Mei: Then this is what cold-brew coffee's supposed to taste like? Hmm... Kousei: It's not THAT bitter. I thought it was pretty easy to drink, personally. Kousei: Don't like it? Mei: It just tastes like coffee. Too bitter! Mei: I guess it's just not for me. Kousei: Ah. Well, that's too bad. Mei: Sorry. I even made you go through the trouble of making this for me... Kousei: No worries. It wasn't that much trouble. Kousei: Hold on a sec. Mei: Huh? O-Okay. Mei: Cafe au lait? Kousei: You've never had one of those before either? Kousei: Well, give it a taste. I guarantee it's not bitter this time. Mei: You sure about that? Don't you be foolin' me again. Kousei: I'm not, I promise. Kousei: Though, even cold-brewed, coffee is still coffee. The taste isn't for everyone. Kousei: But I added gomme syrup this time, so it's not bitter. Mei: And what if it IS? Kousei: Then I'll drink the entire cup through my nose and out my eyes. Mei: Well, if you're that sure... I guess I'll try it. Kousei: Go ahead. Mei: ...... Mei: Urk... F-Fine! Down the hatch! Mei: *gulp* *gulp*... Ohh? I can drink this. Actually, this is pretty good! Kousei: What'd I tell you? Mei: Thank you, Senpai! Kousei: Anything for the customer. Now enjoy your drink, miss. Mei: I will! Kousei: Ah--Shiki-san. Natsume: Huh? A-Ahh?! Natsume: ...... Kousei: Hm? Kousei: Was it something I did? Nothing comes to mind, though. Kousei: Either way, she was running in the same direction where the cafe is located. Kousei: I wonder if she's also heading to the cafe now? Kousei: What the hell did I do? Natsume: Ngh... Natsume: ...... Natsume: No, not really. You're not to blame. Kousei: Then how come you're acting this way around me? Kousei: If I did something to upset you, I want you to tell me. Natsume: I told you, it's nothing you did. Sorry if I gave you that impression, though. Natsume: It's just... embarrassing to look you in the face. Kousei: Why? Did something happen between us? Natsume: Well, you know. Yesterday, I got a little too drunk and... said some pretty embarrassing things to you. Kousei: Well, you were a bit tipsy, but I don't remember you doing anything I'd call \"embarrassing.\" Kousei: Compared to those types of guys who chug drink after drink, you were perfectly normal. No puking or public intoxication whatsoever. Natsume: Really? Kousei: If anything, I thought drunk you was pretty cute. Kousei: You know, all that \"last train\" and \"got ya\" stuff. Natsume: Ngh! Kousei: Wh-What? Natsume: That's exactly what I was talking about! Natsume: I don't usually act like that. It was way out of character for me... Kousei: I don't think it's that big a deal, really. Natsume: Forget it! I want you to wipe every memory from last night clean from your mind! Are we clear?! Kousei: ...... Kousei: What if I said... I can't. You were too cute. Kousei: What would you do? Natsume: Then I'd MAKE you forget. Kousei: Alright, alright. I'll try to forget. At the very least, I won't bring it up again. Kousei: Is that good enough for you? Natsume: Fine. Natsume: But you have to promise me. Kousei: I promise. Natsume: Okay. Well, I'd better get to work. Kousei: Yeah. The kitchen needs me too. Natsume: One more thing... Kousei: Yeah? Natsume: Thanks for walking me home yesterday. Kousei: I hope you weren't too bothered by that. Natsume: Well, even if I did, I wouldn't say it out loud. Kousei: I mean, you're kind of implying you do when you say that. Natsume: I still appreciate it. That's the truth. Natsume: Anyway, I need to get going. Talk to you later. Kousei: ...... Kousei: I'd better get back to work too. Kousei: ...... "

            "Kousei: Morning, everyone. Suzune: Hey. Kanna: Good morning, Takamine-san. Kousei: How are the Yule Logs coming along? Suzune: We're about 80\\% done, I think. Kousei: Is there anything I can help with? Suzune: Wanna start prepping the cheesecakes for me? You remember how to do it, don't you? Kousei: Yeah. Kanna: I'll help out as well. Just tell me what to do. Kousei: Aren't you helping with the Yule Logs, though? Kanna: We've already finished rolling them into log-shapes. All that's left is to add the external decorations, but only Suzune-san is skilled enough to do that. Suzune: I'll be fine. You can go ahead and help him. Kousei: Alright. Mei: Whoa! An actual Yule Log! It looks absolutely scrumptious! Nozomi: Are you finished making them? Suzune: For today, at least. Phew... My shoulders are killing me. Kanna: I'm not surprised. You had to put the finishing touches on all of them. Natsume: Well, they certainly turned out great. Thanks for all your hard work. Kousei: We're not very busy right now, so feel free to take a break if you want, Suzune-san. Suzune: Thanks. I'll take you up on that then. Kanna: Of course. Natsume: Now then, let's get these cakes boxed up. Nozomi & Mei: Okaaay! Mei: Welcome to Cafe Stella! Party of two? If you'd rather not wait, we do have a couple counter seats available right now. Would that be alright? Nozomi: Welcome to Cafe Stella! Ah, you placed an order for two Yule Logs under the name Ota? I'll have them ready for you in just a moment. Natsume: Two pancakes, a blend coffee, and a Guatemalan coffee? I'll have those right out to you. Natsume: Two coffees; house blend and Guatemalan, please. Mikado: Coming right up. Kanna: Oh, Natsume-san! I need to go fetch some more Yule Logs from the kitchen. Can you cover for me while I'm gone? Natsume: I'll go fetch them instead. I need to put in another order anyway. Kanna: Alright, that'd be great. Thank you. Kanna: I apologize for the delay, sir. We'll have them ready in just a minute, so please be patient. Natsume: Order coming in. Two plates of pancakes, please. Kousei: Got it. Suzune: How are the Yule Logs selling? Natsume: Fairly well. Most of the customers who've placed advance orders have arrived to pick them up too. Suzune: Phew. That's a relief... Kousei: Were you that worried? Suzune: Well, yeah. I don't know if they're pranks or what, but sometimes you'll get large orders and then the customer never comes to pick it up. Kousei: That kind of stuff actually happens? I've read stories online, but it's scary how easy it is for a single person to screw you over. Suzune: Fortunately, it doesn't look like that's the case this time. Suzune: Anyway, back to work. Pancakes, was it? Kousei: Yeah. I'll handle them. Suzune: You will? Well, okay. Natsume: I'd better get these Yule Logs delivered too. Suzune: I'll help you carry them. I want to see how our customers are doing anyway. Mei: Welcome to Cafe Stella! Miyama: Hello again. Mei: Oh? You're Yuina-chan's--ah, I beg your pardon. Hello there, Mister Miyama. Miyama: Oh, you don't need to be so formal. Miyama: Actually, I'm also here to pick up a cake that I ordered. Mei: A Yule Log, yes? Wait right here; I'll have it out to you in one moment. Suzune: Welcome. Miyama: Hello again. I just can't ignore your cakes, they're so good. Miyama: My daughter's been looking forward to this for a while too. She says no other cake shop will do. Suzune: I'm flattered. I sincerely hope it's to your liking. Miyama: Oh, no need to worry about that. I'm confident it will be every bit as delicious as all the others I've had before. I'm looking forward to it as well. Suzune: Thank you very much. Your praise means a lot to me. Miyama: Oh, and before I forget. Could I also get some shortcakes, fruit tarts... this cheesecake here... and some mousse cakes, as well? Miyama: Four of each. I'm planning to give them to a few acquaintances as gifts. I'd like more people to see how delicious your cakes are. Especially since it's Christmas Eve, you know. Suzune: Would you like us to include some sort of message? It wouldn't take much time to add a simple plaque to it. Miyama: Oh, no. They're just going to be small gifts for some of my coworkers. I have to get back there once I'm done here. Suzune: It seems like you'll have quite a lot to carry, though... Miyama: Maybe, but I'll manage somehow. The hospital is only a few minutes' walk from here. Suzune: Alright. Mei: Here you are, Mister Miyama. Suzune: Ah, Mei-san. He'd also like shortcakes, fruit tarts, cheesecakes, and champagne mousses. Four of each. Mei: O-Oh, sure! I'll add those to your order. Mei: Let's see... In that case, your total comes to 11,820 yen. Miyama: Alright. One second... Wait, where's my wallet? What? Miyama: Ahh, right. I put it in my bag earlier. Phew. There it is. Miyama: My apologies. Mei: No problem, sir. Now then, you paid with 12,000 yen, so your change comes to 180 yen. Here you are. Miyama: Thank you very much. Suzune: Since you've got quite a few cakes, we separated them into two boxes for you. Miyama: Thank you. Suzune: Thank you for coming, and have a good day. Mei: Come visit us again sometime! Mei: Is he going to be okay with all those cakes? He's not going to get sick, is he? Suzune: They're not all for him. He said he's giving them as gifts to some of his coworkers. Mei: Oh, that makes sense. I guess there's nothing to worry about then. Mei: Ah--welcome to Cafe Stella! Suzune: You know, honestly, it's a lot easier making cakes than dealing with customers. Kousei: How are things looking out there? Suzune: Excellent. Everyone seems as happy as a clam. Suzune: But more importantly, why don't you take a break soon? Things are starting to wind down now. Kousei: Alright. Just let me finish up with this and I will. Kousei: Phew... Mikado: Understood. In that case, we will hold on to it for the meantime. Kousei: Yeah. Mikado: Yes... Yes... Kousei: Is there some kind of problem? Nozomi: Apparently one of our customers forgot something at the cafe, so they called to make sure it's still here. Nozomi: Yeah. They left in a rush so they wouldn't be holding up any other customers. You know how busy the cafe is today, with everyone coming in to pick up their cakes. Mikado: I understand. We'll be waiting. Goodbye. Nozomi: Are they coming back to get it? Mikado: Yes. However, he says that he is rather busy at work at the moment, so he does not know when that will be. Kousei: Then should we keep the bag in the fridge in the meantime? Mikado: No need. I am told it merely contains a Christmas present for his daughter. Kousei: Oh. But if so, he'll need to come get it by tonight. Kousei: As a parent, he's got to be feeling pretty anxious. Nozomi: Probably, yeah. Mikado: Hmm. Would you be willing to deliver it to him for us, Takamine Kousei? Nozomi: Oh, you're right! We can just bring it to him instead! Kousei: I guess I don't mind. Does he live around here? Mikado: You remember the little girl named Miyama Yuina who came to order a cake for her father's birthday, don't you? Mikado: The customer who forgot this present is her father. Kousei: Ahh. So that means I'll be going to the Miwa General Hospital? Mikado: Indeed. It might ruin the surprise for little Yuina if you were to deliver to their house instead. Nozomi: That's probably why her dad wanted to come pick it up himself. Mikado: Yes. Kousei: But that's enough reminiscing. I have a job to do. Kousei: No, I'm looking for a Dr. Miyama. I'm here to return something he forgot. Female Nurse: Ahh. Yes, I've been told. Female Nurse: Please give me a moment. He said he'd like to thank you in person. Female Nurse: He says he'll be with you in a minute. Would you mind waiting? It won't be long. Kousei: Sure. Kousei: Huh? Oh, I'm sorry. I was spacing out a little. Miyama: That's quite alright. I'm the one who should be apologizing. Some father I am, forgetting my own daughter's Christmas present. Miyama: Thank you for returning it to me. I truly appreciate it. Kousei: It was no big deal. Kousei: Can I ask you a question, though? These drawings--they haven't always been here, have they? Miyama: Oh, have they not? They were here when I first started working here. ???: Oh? Dr. Miyama? What are you doing out here? "

            "Kanna: Oh dear! Were you hoping to see me in a maid uniform as well, Takamine-san? Kousei: That's not why I asked. Kanna: So you don't want to see me wear one? Kousei: I mean... I wouldn't say no. Kanna: Nihihi. That's what I thought. Kanna: But unfortunately, the plan is for me to work in the kitchen. I won't be appearing on the dining floor. Kousei: That's a shame. I bet it'd suit you really well. Kanna: Compliments won't get you anything. Except maybe a cup of coffee. Kanna: Here you are. Kousei: Thanks. Kousei: It's not bad. Hell, it's actually quite good. Kanna: Really? You don't have to be polite, you know. I want your honest opinion. Kousei: I am being honest. But... while it's definitely good, there's just nothing special... nothing unique about it. Kanna: I see... Kousei: Sorry. Maybe that's a poor choice of words. Kousei: I wouldn't have any complaints if I ordered this coffee. It's perfectly acceptable. Kanna: But what you're saying is, it's just a regular cup of coffee, right? Kousei: In a manner of speaking. Kanna: I guess I'll need to do some more research if I want to brew a better cup... Kousei: ...... Kousei: So is that the only reason you haven't been able to open for business yet? You can't tell if your coffee's any good? Natsume: We-- Woman: Hello, Natsume-chan. Woman: Would you please prepare a cup of blended coffee for me? Natsume: Certainly. I'll have it ready in a moment. Kousei: ...... Woman: Thank you. Now, let me have a taste. Natsume: What... do you think? Woman: ...... Woman: Natsume-chan... Perhaps this isn't going to work after all. Natsume: ...... Natsume: But... we still have some time before end of the month, don't we? Woman: Yes, but... Natsume: Please, give me a little longer. I promise I'll deliver next time. If you truly think there's no hope by then... I'll give up... Woman: ...... Woman: Alright. A promise is a promise. Try not to push yourself too hard, dear. Natsume: I won't. Thank you. Woman: I'll stop by again soon. Natsume: Of course. We'll be waiting. Kanna: I know. Kousei: Sorry, I'm not sure I do. Natsume: That woman here just now was our landlady. We need her approval in order to open the cafe. Natsume: She agreed to give us approval if we managed to satisfy her as a customer, but... Kousei: It's not going too well, huh? Natsume: She's already visited us several times, but... we just can't seem to meet her standards. Natsume: That's why we needed the help of someone who knows what good coffee tastes like. So we can improve our blend. Kousei: You mentioned something about the end of the month too... Natsume: We've only been allowed to rent this place temporarily, you see. Although our initial agreement was set to expire in the summer, we managed convince her to give us until October, but... Kousei: Still no luck. Natsume: Unfortunately not. Natsume: I think I need to take a break for a bit. Is that alright? Kanna: Ah--yes, of course. Natsume: Thanks. I'll leave the rest to you. Kousei: ...... Kanna: You could say that. Right now, she's on the verge of giving up on something very important herself. At this rate-- Kousei: Her soul will end up lingering the world of the living? Kanna: It's possible, yes. But if we can manage to open this cafe, we might just be able to prevent that. Kousei: She didn't seem particularly supportive, though. Kanna: I wouldn't say she's been unkind to us either. Kousei: Well at any rate, the point is that she isn't satisfied as a customer, right? Kousei: Does she only have a problem with the coffee? What about the other menu items? Kanna: We did have her try our omelet rice one time. Mikado: And our black tea, as well. Kousei: Omelet rice and black tea, huh... Kousei: I'd like to see how those taste too, if that's okay. Would you mind? Mikado: Kanna can prepare the omelet rice for you, but Natsume was the one who made the tea. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Incidentally, what exactly is your job going to be? Mikado: I will be charge of making drinks. I'm already proficient in brewing both coffee and tea. Kousei: I-I see... Kanna: Of course. Leave it to me. Kanna: Please watch over things while I whip up a prototype, Mikado-san. Mikado: Understood. Kanna: Come, Takamine-san. Let's head over to the kitchen, shall we? Kanna: Now then, let's get started. Kanna: We'll need a couple eggs, an onion, some chicken... Kanna: I told you I had a lot of practice. Did you not believe me? Kousei: That's not it, but... Kousei: Do Grim Reapers even need to eat food like regular people to survive? Kanna: It is possible for us to survive without eating, since we're sustained by the power of God. Kanna: But survival isn't everything. If we didn't eat, our souls would weaken... and our physical health would suffer as well. Kousei: Huh. I see. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Was I scowling or something? Sorry. I didn't mean to. Kanna: No, no. I didn't mean it like that. Kanna: It just feels like all my cooking skills are being put to the test... That's why it's a little scary. Kousei: No pressure. This is all just practice too. Kanna: I suppose you're right... Kanna: Here you are! The results of hours upon hours of omelet rice practice! Kousei: Wow, it came out beautifully. This is some restaurant-level quality. Kousei: Actually, I prefer my ketchup spread evenly over the egg... Kanna: Ahh?! What about all my hard work?! Kousei: It's great. Kanna: You really mean it? Kousei: There wouldn't be any point in complimenting you for the sake of it. My life depends on how many customers we can attract, after all. Kousei: It tastes great. It's hard to put into words, but... it has a really gentle flavor. Like a lot of care was put into making it. Kanna: You think so? Well I'm glad you like it. Kousei: I'd have no problems paying for something like this. Omelet rice might be a personal favorite of mine, but I'd definitely order this again sometime. Kousei: It wouldn't even be surprised if it becomes our signature dish. Kanna: ...... Kanna: I'm... very happy to hear you say that. Very, very happy. Kousei: ...... Kousei: There's no need to look that flattered. Kanna: *giggle* Don't say that. A real man has to take responsibility for the compliments he gives. Kousei: Still, I'm only giving you my amateur opinion. I can't guarantee this'll actually sell well. Kanna: But you weren't lying just to spare my feelings, were you? Kousei: No. I really would love to eat this again sometime. Kanna: That's good to hear. Kousei: You must have had to practice a lot to make something this delicious, huh? Kanna: Yes, you could say that... It definitely wasn't easy. Kanna: But that's why it makes me so happy to hear how much you enjoyed it. Kanna: Really... really happy... "

Kousei: I'm not sure what the baseball player has to do with anything, though. Hiroto: We're just gonna play baseball sometime soon! With you as the ball! Kousei: %123;I don't wanna die! Acquaintance B: It's what you deserve. Acquaintance A: You said she was just a coworker last time! Hiroto: We all saw you holding hands this morning. You can't weasel your way out of it this time. Hiroto: Come to think of it, you never told me shit about this. Did you really lie to my face? I thought we were friends. Kousei: The last time she came to ask me out, we really were nothing more than coworkers. I swear. Hiroto: So you aren't now? Kousei: Err... kinda... Kousei: Now we're, uh... dating. One thing led to another over New Year's, and, well... Hiroto: Ah, so you weren't pulling my finger! It only happened after New Year's. Great. Kousei: Yeah, that's what I've been trying to say. I'm just as surprised as you are, to be honest. Hiroto: Congratulations, Kousei. Kousei: Thanks, Hiroto. You're a real pal. Hiroto: And now, goodbye. Acquaintance A: Dogs? Acquaintance B: Hell no. Fish. Kousei: Don't feed me to either! For God's sake, calm down! Hiroto: Yeah, I guess. No point in letting our emotions get the best of us. Hiroto: If you think about it, I'd much rather Shiki-san be dating one of my friends than some random fratboy douchebag. Hiroto: Actually, no. On second thought, I'm still pissed. Acquaintance A: Guilty on all counts. Send him to the gallows. Acquaintance B: Don't get hasty, friend. Torture comes first. Kousei: Don't I even get the right to a trial?! Hiroto: It just doesn't make sense, man. Kousei: What doesn't? Hiroto: I'll admit I'm jealous that you managed to get a girlfriend... but I'm willing to let that slide. Hiroto: What REALLY pisses me off is the fact that you're DATING SHIKI NATSUME, OF ALL PEOPLE! IT'S NOT POSSIBLE! I REFUSE TO BELIEVE IT! Acquaintance A: Turn yourself in, Takamine. Blackmailing is a serious crime. Kousei: %123;I'm not blackmailing her! Acquaintance B: You're using some kinda hypnosis app, aren't you?! Tell us where you got it! Kousei: %123;This isn't some fucking hentai, dammit! Kousei: I thought you guys were my friends! Aren't you supposed to be congratulating me?! Hiroto: What? Please. A traitor like you is no friend of mine. Hiroto: It's not fair! Why do you get Shiki-san as your girlfriend while I'm stuck here with nothing! Kousei: Well, it was mostly just luck. Kousei: So don't sweat it, Hiroto. I'm sure you'll find a girlfriend soon too. Hiroto: Kousei... Hiroto: That's easy to say when you actually have a girlfriend, asshole. Kousei: Sorry. I realize that sounded a bit condescending too. Hiroto: Goddammit! Screw studying! I'm drinking away my sorrows tonight! Acquaintance A: Right there with you, Shioyama! Acquaintance B: Count me in too! I need a damn drink after all this shit! Hiroto: Listen, Kousei. After this class, we're going to lunch together, and you're gonna tell us exactly how you managed to bag Shiki Natsume. Kousei: Sorry, but I'll have to pass. Hiroto: Why? Kousei: Because I already told Natsume I'd eat with her. Acquaintance A: He's guilty. Acquaintance B: Torture him. Hiroto: Send him to the gallows. Kousei: Will you stop that already? Natsume: You seem kind of tired. Kousei: It's been a rough morning. Kousei: Been having to deal with a lot of, uh... questions, you see. Kousei: Yeah. Everyone's curious how it happened. Natsume: I know what you mean... Kousei: Oh, have you been getting the same? Natsume: Yeah. At first, they were mainly asking if I was alright since I'd been in the hospital. Natsume: But after that, all the girls in my class kept pestering me nonstop about my boyfriend. And some of the more annoying guys as well. Kousei: What did the guys say? Natsume: They wanted to know if the rumors were true, why I was dating such a boring guy. Saying I was too good for you, or that we should break up. Stuff like that. Kousei: Well... I guess that's to be expected. Natsume: Why? Kousei: I'm just saying I can understand why some people might think that way. Kousei: Not that I agree　with them, though. Kinda pisses me off, being treated like that. Natsume: It pissed me off. That's why I slugged them. Kousei: %123;Why would you reward them?! Natsume: ...... Kousei: Calm down, I'm kidding. Kousei: But anyway, how's your hand? I'd hate to think you hurt yourself over something so stupid. Natsume: I know. I was just kidding too. I didn't punch anyone, but I did give them a piece of my mind. Kousei: Oh? What'd you tell them? Natsume: ...... Natsume: Not telling. Kousei: Oh, come on. Natsume: Anyway, don't listen to them. You're my boyfriend, so you should be proud and confident in yourself. Kousei: I know. I'm not going to let a few haters get me down. Kousei: Even if YOU end up hating me--I'm sticking with you for the rest of your life! Natsume: That's a little creepy, to be honest... but you don't need to worry. That'll never happen. Kousei: Yeah, I know. I'm only joking. Kousei: But yeah, my feelings for you aren't going to change either. Just remember that. Natsume: I will. Oh, by the way, tonight-- Kousei: Sorry, but I can't today. Kousei: Hiroto made me promise to go drinking with him. If I turn him down, there's a good chance I'm gonna be murdered by a violent mob. Natsume: What? Kousei: Anyway, I can't. I'm sorry! Natsume: It's okay. I was actually going to tell you I already had plans tonight too. Kousei: Oh. Really? Natsume: Yeah... I'm having dinner with a few girls from my major program. Kousei: Oh, wow. You don't go eat out with friends often. Natsume: They said they'd only help me catch up on the material I missed from my classes while I was in the hospital if I agreed to have dinner with them. Natsume: You know how people are always calling me the \"Solitary Sniper\" or whatever, right? Natsume: Well, they were curious how someone like me suddenly got a boyfriend. It'll probably be a pain answering all their questions, but oh well. Natsume: Oh--but don't worry. They're not the same people who were badmouthing you earlier. Kousei: Hmm. So it's a girls' night out, basically? Natsume: Huh. Now that you mention it, I suppose that is what this'll be. Kousei: The one thing I'll never get to experience with you, sadly. Natsume: A girl's night out, huh? That might actually be kind of fun... Kousei: I mean, if you're going anyway, you might as well enjoy it, no? Natsume: Yeah. Kousei: Well, have fun. If anything happens, though, give me a call. Kousei: If you drink too much, or feel like leaving halfway through, I'll come get you. Natsume: Thanks. Hiroto: ...... Kousei: What the hell? Don't ignore me! Hiroto: Relax. It's a joke. Acquaintance A: We're just going out to eat, man. Acquaintance B: We've already made a reservation at the pub. Chill out. Hiroto: We just wanna ask you some stuff about Shiki-san while we gripe and bitch some. That's all. Kousei: Well, alright. Hiroto: Even if we are super fucking jealous, we're still friends, so the bill's on us today. Kousei: And here I thought I was a \"traitor.\" Hiroto: Well... after hearing those nasty rumors, I can't bring myself to mess with you any more. Kousei: What rumors? Acquaintance B: What, haven't you heard? Acquaintance A: Everyone's talking about y'all. Hiroto: Well, I guess rumors aren't supposed to reach the person they're about. Kousei: Seriously, what rumors? Hiroto: A lot of people are wondering if you and Shiki-san are really a thing. Hiroto: And, uhh, apparently a bunch of guys are saying she's, like, way too good for you, or whatever. Kousei: You guys have been saying that too, though. Acquaintance A: You can't blame us for being jealous! Acquaintance B: Yeah! I fucking hate seeing other people happy! Makes me wanna puke! Kousei: You've made that more than clear already, dude! Acquaintance A: But you know we're only kidding, for the most part. Acquaintance B: We wouldn't be taking you out if we actually hated your guts, you know? Hiroto: But apparently, Shiki-san's had to deal with people trash-talking you nonstop. Hiroto: Eventually she got fed up and said to them: Natsume: I appreciate all your concern and valuable input, but rest assured. Natsume: At the very least, my boyfriend isn't a scumbag who has to insult others to make themselves feel better. If he were, I wouldn't have fallen for him. Natsume: I'm perfectly happy with who he is. Kousei: Wow. Natsume said that? Hiroto: So I heard. Or at least, that's what the rumor mill's saying. Hiroto: Looks she's pretty serious about you, eh? Good for you. Kousei: Well, I already knew that. Kousei: But I guess the confirmation doesn't hurt. Kousei: Things must've been pretty awkward in the classroom afterwards. Hiroto: Why are you complaining? Aren't you glad your girlfriend loves you that much? Kousei: Of course I am! Kousei: But I'm worried for her at the same time. I don't want people thinking she's rude and unsociable. Hiroto: You don't have to worry about that. Acquaintance A: Apparently, most people agreed with her and thought she had every right to be angry. Acquaintance B: Even the guys who started it looked ashamed and tried to laugh it off. Hiroto: In any case, I don't think anyone blamed her for her outburst. Kousei: Ah. Well, that's a relief. Hiroto: Motherfucker. Now I'm getting pissed again. Acquaintance A: You shouldn't have told him. Acquaintance B: On second thought, you can pay for your own food today. Kousei: What?! Why?! Hiroto: It doesn't make any damn sense! Why the hell are we treating you?! You're the happy one, while we just feel like shit! Acquaintance A: Yeah! Share some of that happiness with us, why don't you?! Acquaintance B: In fact, you're the one who should be paying OUR tab! Kousei: %123;The hell?! You're the ones who asked ME out! Kousei: But eh, whatever. I guess I don't mind. Acquaintance B: Wait, really? Kousei: I don't know about you, but after hearing what Natsume said about me, I feel like celebrating. All Three: Fuck this guy. Kousei: Man, what do you want from me then? Kousei: Look, can we hurry up and go to the pub? I'm freezing out here. Acquaintance A: Where are we going again? Acquaintance B: The place we went to last time, remember? The cheap one with good food. Acquaintance A: Oh, that place. Acquaintance B: I would've picked a more expensive place if I knew Takamine was buying, though! Kousei: Hey. I said I'd pay, but that doesn't mean you can screw me over! "

Well... that's fine, I guess. Kousei: I love you, Natsume... Natsume: Mhm. I love you too... Natsume: *sigh*... Kousei: ...... Kousei: Something wrong? Natsume: The regret's kinda setting in, now that I remember we have work tomorrow... I'm going to be exhausted for sure. Kousei: Good thing it's March break. Natsume: I know you have to wake up early tomorrow too, Kousei. Sorry. Kousei: Don't be. I'm the one who wanted this in the first place. Natsume: Well, that much was obvious. Natsume: It's fine. I wanted this too. Natsume: Let's just try not to make any mistakes at work tomorrow. Kousei: Yeah. We should probably go to sleep a bit earlier tonight... Kousei: But there's actually something I want to talk to you about first, Natsume. Natsume: Hm? What's that? Kousei: You know, we're gonna be seniors soon. Natsume: Oh, I guess we are. We're going to have to start looking for a real job before long. Kousei: Be honest with me. You want to keep working at the cafe, don't you? Natsume: Yeah. Natsume: Not because I'm afraid of job hunting, or anything stupid like that... But if I could, I'd really like to protect that cafe for as long as I can. Kousei: That's what I thought. Kousei: And I want to protect that dream of yours too. Kousei: That's why, um--I was thinking of becoming a pastry chef. Natsume: ...... Kousei: I want to run that cafe together with you, Natsume. Kousei: Not because you influenced my decision, or anything. This is something I've decided for myself. Kousei: Even if you end up getting a regular job, my feelings won't change. Kousei: That cafe means a lot to me too. I can't think of anywhere else I'd rather work. Kousei: So I... Err, sorry. I can't explain it very well... but anyway, it's something like that! Kousei: You understand where I'm coming from... right? Natsume: Yeah... I do. Kousei: I'll work extra hard to keep Cafe Stella going. Natsume: Then I'll have to work just as hard. Natsume: There won't be much point in you becoming a pastry chef if the cafe goes under, after all. Kousei: Yeah. So... let's do this, together. Natsume: Of course. Natsume: You know, I'm so glad I met you, Kousei. Being together with you right now makes me happier than words can describe. Kousei: Me too. Natsume: In fact, I'm growing happier by the moment. Natsume: Day by day, I find myself falling in love with you more and more. I really have changed, haven't I? Kousei: By all means, fall in love with me as much as you want. Kousei: 'Cause I plan on doing exactly the same for you. Natsume: Alright then. Kousei: Yeah. Forever and ever. I'm never letting you go, so you'd better be prepared. Natsume: Bring it on. Natsume: I'm never letting go of you either. "

Natsume: How are things at the cafe? Kousei: Same as ever. Kousei: Things are just as busy as they were before the holidays. Natsume: Ah. That's good. Kousei: Well, that also means we aren't getting any new customers. But Suzune-san's been thinking about a new cake product to gather interest. Natsume: Oh. Kousei: Ahh, sorry. You probably don't want to hear about work right now. Kousei: At any rate, the cafe's doing fine. So take it easy and get some rest, Natsume. Natsume: Thanks, but you don't need to worry about me. They're only having me stay here to do a couple more tests, just to be on the safe side. Natsume: I feel completely fine, yet they still won't let me out of bed. *sigh*... I'm so bored. Kousei: I know, but just do what they say till they discharge you. Please. Kousei: You had me worried enough when you were unconscious. Natsume: That's hardly fair of you to bring up... Natsume: How am I supposed to say no to that? Kousei: So you'll promise me? Natsume: Sure, whatever. I promise. Natsume: Then again, I'll be able to leave as early as tomorrow, barring any new problems. Kousei: That's sooner than I thought. Natsume: I guess it's true what they say--health and sickness start with the mind. Even the nurses were surprised at how quickly I recovered. Kousei: Well, I'm glad to hear that. Kousei: Speaking of the cafe, though. I heard your parents wanted you to quit working there after this little incident. Natsume: I appreciate their concern, but there's no way I'm going to quit. That cafe is like a home to me. Kousei: Yeah. I know what you mean. Natsume: Mhm. Anyway, let's change the subject. Kousei: Alright. Let's see--I know you said you feel fine now, but is there anything else that's bothering you? Natsume: Well, the hospital food is still as bland as I remember it being. I wanna eat something with more flavor. I wanna eat something with calories. Natsume: Hmm. I want fried shrimp. From that Western-style restaurant we went to last time, remember? Kousei: No problem. I'll buy you as much as you can eat. Kousei: But until then, I'm afraid you're gonna have to bear with the food here. Natsume: ...... Natsume: Fine... but in return, I want something else. Right here and now. Kousei: What's that? Natsume: %61;...iss... Kousei: Sorry, could you repeat that? Natsume: Tch... Kousei: Wait, why are you clicking your tongue at me? I genuinely couldn't hear you, I swear! Natsume: Just lean in and give me your ear. Kousei: O-Okay. Kousei: What? Natsume: Thank you. Kousei: Well, that was... something. Kousei: It's not every day I get to make out with a girl on a hospital bed... Natsume: ...... Kousei: ...... Natsume & Kousei: Ahh?!\nAck?! Female Nurse: Quiet, please. Natsume & Kousei: W-We're sorry.\nW-We're sorry. Female Nurse: Goodness gracious. I understand that you're young and frisky, but don't forget that this is a hospital. Natsume & Kousei: ......\n...... Female Nurse: I'll leave it at that. But you mustn't take this any further, understand? Natsume & Kousei: We weren't!\nWe really weren't! Natsume: He was just about to leave anyway. Right? Kousei: Y-Yeah. Female Nurse: You don't have to leave on my account. I just happened to be passing by. Now if you'll excuse me. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Well, guess I should be going soon. Natsume: O-Okay. Be careful on your way back. Kousei: What time are you going to be discharged tomorrow? I'll come pick you up. Natsume: You don't need to do that. I'm going straight to the cafe after I get out anyway. Natsume: I want to see how things are going. And I want to eat one of Suzune-san's cakes too. Kousei: Alright. I'll let the others know. Kousei: Yeah. Somei: Man, lucky her. I'm so jealous. Somei: Not only did her dream of working at a cafe come true, she gets a boyfriend TOO? I wish she'd share some of that luck with me. Kousei: Your dream came true too, didn't it? You got to climb that mountain you drew. Somei: Yeah, but I still don't have a boyfriend. Aww, I want a man too! Kousei: I'm surprised you don't. You're pretty cute. Somei: Oh-ho? Cheatin' on Natsume-chan already? I'm telling! Kousei: Wait. Does that mean you've spoken with her? Somei: Ah, no. I was kidding. I haven't gone to see her yet. Kousei: Why not? You're in the same hospital ward. Somei: Well, y'know. I don't know how to feel about saying hi to her after all this time. Somei: It'd be pretty awkward if she doesn't remember me, don't you think? Kousei: You're afraid of learning that the memories you shared weren't as important to her as they were to you. Is that it? Somei: Huh. How did you know that? What are you, some kind of psychic? Kousei: No. Natsume just mentioned something similar to me once. Somei: Oh, really? Somei: I guess nobody's worries are as unique as they think... Kousei: I'm sure Natsume would be happy to see you. Somei: Maybe, but, like... despite how I might come off, I'm actually a rather shy person. Kousei: But you and Natsume weren't the only kids who drew those pictures out there. Kousei: Don't you keep in contact with any of the other patients? Somei: Not really. Somei: I did ask for their contact information when I left the hospital, but it turns out a lot of the others kids lived pretty far away. Kousei: Ah, that makes sense. Plus their phone numbers have probably changed over the years too. Somei: Yeah, and while I might've been fortunate enough to make a full recovery and lead a healthy life, I don't know if that was the case for the rest of them. Somei: I've always been too scared to ask, y'know? "

Lady A: I wonder if they still have that Mont Blanc special going on? Lady B: I do hope so. They were delicious. It'd be a shame if it ended before I got to have another. Kousei: Welcome to Cafe Stella, milady. Lady A: What? Oh my... Lady C: Did he say \"milady\"? Wh-What is this? What's going on? Kousei: Today, we are hosting a special afternoon tea service. Lady B: Oh. I heard about that, but I didn't know it was today. Lady C: Ahh, so that's what they're doing? My goodness... Lady A: I-I can't say I was expecting to be greeted like that! Kousei: My humblest apologies. Kousei: But please, allow me to escort you to your seats. Lady A: O-Oh, yes, of course. Kousei: Now if you'll follow me. Kousei: Please accept my sincere apologies for startling you earlier. Lady C: Oh, that's quite alright. Lady A: If I may ask, what exactly's so special about this afternoon tea? Lady B: Is there a special menu? Kousei: We are offering a traditional afternoon tea set. Kousei: The set will include tea, sandwiches, scones, as well as cakes of your own choosing, which I shall bring once you have decided on your desired selections. Lady A: Sandwiches, you say? Lady B: I'm not sure if I'll have enough room in my stomach, to be honest... Kousei: Rest assured. These sandwiches are small enough to be eaten in a single bite. Kousei: But if you would prefer to have dessert instead, you also have the option of changing it to a fruit sandwich. Lady C: Well... What do you think, ladies? Kousei: Take as much time as you need. Once you've decided, let me know and I will be right over. Lady B: Thank you. Mikado: Indeed. You did well. Mikado: Take a look at your customer's faces. They seem to be quite pleased. Lady A: Goodness. That nearly made me jump, being called \"milady\" out of the blue like that. Lady B: That might be the first time anyone's called me that in my life! Lady C: But you know, it doesn't feel half-bad either. Lady A: Oh, it definitely doesn't. But if I could choose, I think I'd have preferred Mikado-san to serve us instead, with that deep voice of his. Lady C: Ohh, I know what you mean. Lady B: He's definitely got that air of sophistication about him--but there's a certain charm to younger boys as well. Lady C: I'm right there with you! It's like... \"I wish I had a son like that!\" All I've got are a bunch of girls at home... Lady B: Look at that lively complexion, bursting with youth... It's nice to have a change of pace every once in a while, don't you think? Lady A: ...... Lady A: Hmm. I guess you're right. Lady C: Besides, I'm sure you'll get a chance to interact with Mikado-san next time, if they continue doing this event. Lady B: Ohh. Now I'm looking forward to more than just the cake! Lady C: Anyway, what should we order? Should we try that afternoon tea set? Lady B: Sound good to me. Lady A: Alright, then I'm ringing the bell. Natsume: ...... Mikado: Your guests appear to be calling for you. Go on. Kousei: Right. Kousei: You called, milady? Lady C: Could we order that afternoon tea set you mentioned earlier? Kousei: Certainly. Kousei: Which type of sandwich would you prefer? Would you prefer the fruit sandwiches instead? Lady B: No, that's alright. We'll go with the regular ones. Kousei: Absolutely. Kousei: What sort of tea would you like? I'd recommend the house blend we have prepared to go with the set. Lady A: Sounds great. We'll go with that. Kousei: An excellent choice. I will return later to inquire about your choice of cake. For now, please enjoy yourselves. Kousei: One tea set with a house blend. Mikado: Understood. Kousei: Sorry, Natsume. Would you mind brewing the tea for me? You're much better at it than I am. Kousei: I'll go see to the other guests. Gotta put my practice to work. Natsume: Well... Okay, sure. Kousei: Could you go check on the cakes for me, Mikado? Kousei: I'm going to pass their orders on to the kitchen. Mikado: Very well. Kousei: Order coming in! Tea set for three! Student C: Heya there, Shiki-san! How's it going? Natsume: Welcome to Cafe Stella, milady. Female Student B: M-Milady? Female Student A: Umm, what's with the getup? Natsume: Today, Cafe Stella is hosting a special afternoon tea service. Female Student A: Afternoon tea? You mean, this is all part of the service too? Natsume: Yes, that is correct. Female Student B: O-Oh. Female Student B: Haha... It's kind of embarrassing hearing you speak all politely. Female Student A: Anyway, are there seats available at the moment? Natsume: Why, of course. Right this way. Kousei: Hm? Student C: You know, we had that little talk last time. Did it help? Do you need any more pointers? Natsume: A-Ahem... I'm terribly sorry, milady. But since I am on duty at the moment... Female Student A: Oh, leave her alone. Where do you think we are? Female Student B: Do you think she's gonna answer that in public, you idiot? Student C: Oops... Sorry about that. I didn't mean to put you on the spot. Natsume: That's alright. I appreciate your concern, nonetheless. Natsume: In any case, please ring me over with this bell once you've decided on your order. Now then, if you'll excuse me. Female Student A: Wow. She's like an actual maid. Female Student B: I think it suits her personality really well, though. Student C: Looks like we picked a great time to visit! Female Student B: You're having a bit too much fun, if you ask me. Kousei: Hey. Friends of yours? Natsume: Huh? Oh, well, kind of. I think they are, at least. Kousei: That's an odd way to put it. Natsume: I mean, I do like them. It's just that we only got to know each other very recently. Natsume: Sorry. Do you think you could take over that table for me instead? They're a bit much for me to handle at the moment. Kousei: Err, I don't really get it, but sure. Student C: Oh? Where's Shiki-san? Kousei: Forgive me. I simply did not wish to keep you waiting, so I took the liberty of responding to your call first. Kousei: Do I fall short of your expectations, perhaps, milady? Female Student B: N-No! That's not it. Female Student A: It's okay. We shouldn't demand her specifically when you guys are so busy. Student C: Aww... Female Student A: We aren't having \"that\" conversation here anyway, so stop complaining. Female Student B: But enough about that. C'mon, let's order something. Female Student A: Yeah, you're right. What do I want? Hmm. I think I'll have the pancakes. Student C: I'll have... Ohh! The deluxe pancakes. Female Student B: I guess I'll go with that too. Female Student A: Actually, could I change mine to the deluxe version too? Kousei: Of course. Three orders of deluxe pancakes. Kousei: What would you like to drink? Female Student B: House blend coffee for me. Female Student A: I'll have a Darjeeling. Student C: And I'll have... Hmm... Do you have any recommendations for tea? Kousei: Personally, I would suggest a nice cup of Keemun. Kousei: It is a smoky black tea with minimal astringency and piquant aftertones. Kousei: I believe it would pair quite nicely with the strawberries from your deluxe pancake. Student C: Sounds great! Keemun then, please. Kousei: Excellent choice. I will have those out to you shortly. Kousei: In the meantime, please enjoy yourselves, miladies. Student C: Okay, thanks! Natsume: ...... Kousei: Drink orders coming in. We need a blend coffee, a Darjeeling, and a Keemun. Natsume: Did those girls, um, say anything to you? Kousei: Hm? Not really. They just ordered like normal. Kousei: They probably didn't even realize that I go to the same college as them, let alone that I'm your boyfriend. Kousei: I feel like I've seen then before, but even I don't recognize them well enough. Natsume: Oh. Well, never mind then. Kousei: Anyway, I'm gonna pass their orders on to the kitchen. I'll leave the drinks to you. Student C: What do you mean \"why\"? That butler was pretty hot, wasn't he? Female Student B: I didn't know that was your type. Student C: Well, I wouldn't say he's my type, per se, but he's not like most guys I hook up with. It's nice going with someone different, every now and again. Female Student A: Every now and again? You're way too slutty. Student C: What? Isn't it normal to have sex with someone before dating them? You won't know if you're compatible otherwise. Female Student A: Th-That's definitely not normal! You've got it totally backwards! Female Student B: Alright, alright. Keep your voices down. We're in a cafe. Female Student A: Yeah, but she's talking about sleeping with someone before dating them! That's just weird! Student C: Maybe I should try flirting with him! Female Student B: Don't do anything too embarrassing, okay? We're here too. Female Student A: I thought you were never supposed to do stuff with someone until you're dating... Wait a minute--am I too old-fashioned? Is THAT why I'm still a virgin? Female Student B: Oh, not that again. It's nothing to be ashamed of, you know. Female Student A: Easy for you guys to say. Urk... Female Student B: Look, all I'm saying is, there's nothing wrong with your way of thinking about it. Female Student A: Right?! Student C: *giggle*! Natsume: ...... Kousei: Thank you for your patience. Here is your blend coffee, Darjeeling, and Keemun tea. Kousei: Allow me to pour your drinks for you. Student C: Thank you! Kousei: ...... Kousei: Thank you, milady. Your praise honors me. Student C: Are you really a professional butler? Kousei: No, I'm afraid I am merely still an apprentice. Student C: Hey, so if you're interested, would you like to become MY butler sometime? Natsume: ...... Kousei: But I already am your butler, milady. Student C: Oh, silly. I mean outside the cafe. Student C: What time do you get off work? Wanna hang out with me after? Kousei: My apologies. Unfortunately, I will be busy preparing for milady's next visit till late. Kousei: I mustn't neglect my duties; polishing tableware, training myself to brew more delicious tea, and so on. Student C: Oh. Actually, could I just have your number instead? Kousei: Rest assured, you may summon me at any time simply by ringing this bell. Student C: No, that's not what I-- Female Student B: Oh my God. Give it a rest, will you? Female Student A: You're being a nuisance! Student C: Hmph. Kousei: Please ring this bell again if you would like me to refill your drinks, and I will be right over. Female Student A: We will. Thanks. Female Student B: And we're sorry about our friend here. Kousei: Not at all. I appreciate her attempts at making idle conversation. Thank you very much. Kousei: Please, enjoy your tea. Now if you'll excuse me. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Ahh! *pant* *pant*! H-Holy crap, that was so nerve-wracking... Mikado: I would say you handled it well, for the most part. I doubt anyone could object to the responses you gave. Kousei: Well, that's a relief. Kousei: Wait, \"for the most part\"? Was there something I did wrong? Mikado: Well... I suppose you may have overdone it a little. Kousei: How so? Student C: Oh my gosh... Maybe I've got a thing for butlers after all. Female Student A: He didn't seem interested in you at all, though, judging by his reaction. Student C: That aloofness is exactly what gets me going! He's serious about his job, but didn't turn me down in a hurtful way either. Student C: That means there's still a chance. Female Student B: He seemed pretty used to dealing with women, though. You sure he doesn't already have a girlfriend? Student C: Aww, you think so? I had a feeling that was the case too, but I was hoping I'd be wrong... Student C: The thought of stealing him away... Ohh, now I'm getting all fired up! Female Student A: Well, you shouldn't be! Female Student B: Oh, geez. I'm already feeling sorry for the office that ends up hiring this girl. Kousei: What do you mean I \"overdid\" it? Mikado: No, forget it. Let it weigh on you too much, and you may end up making even more mistakes. Mikado: You only need to continue as you've been doing up until now. Kousei: A-Alright. If you say so... Mikado: Ah, it appears I've been summoned. Excuse me. Kousei: What he was talking about?

Kousei: Thank you very much for visiting us today. We hope to see you again soon. Kousei: Phew. I guess that's a wrap. Mikado: Indeed. Good work today. Kousei: Looks like we made it through without any bumps along the way... How do you guys think we did? Mikado: I would say it went fairly well, wouldn't you? Kousei: What about you, Natsume?

Mei: Then once you're finished, tap the share button. That's all there is to it. Kanna: Aha! So this is how you use a smartphone! Mei: See? Pretty simple, ain't it? Kanna: It's pretty incredible that you can do all this with just a finger... but I'm not sure I'd call it \"simple,\" per se. Nozomi: You'll get used to it with enough practice.

Mei: While we're at it, why don't we try taking a picture together? Just open the app and press this button here. Nozomi: Stretch your arm out a bit more. And let's get our faces a bit closer too.

Kanna: A postage stamp? Nozomi: Not that kind of stamp. They're sort of like stickers you use to decorate the picture. See? Kanna: Goodness... I can hardly keep track of all these different features! Kousei: ...... Kousei: Looks like you two are getting along well. Nozomi: Hm? Me and who? Kousei: Akizuki-san. Y'know, in the store earlier? Nozomi: Is that really a surprise? We're coworkers, so it's normal for us to be friends. Nozomi: I'm not a hermit like a certain someone. Kousei: Hardy-har. You know me too well. Nozomi: I don't think it's a laughing matter, to be honest... Nozomi: But you've changed a bit, haven't you? You definitely seem more cheerful these days.

Kousei: You're not working too hard or anything, are you? Nozomi: I told you, I'm fine. I'm not lying, really. Stop worrying. Kousei: Well, if you ever need help with anything, just lemme know. Nozomi: Hmm... Kousei: Is there actually something? Nozomi: It's not urgent or anything, but I kinda wanna brush up on my coffee- and tea-making skills. Kousei: You've been practicing, haven't you? Nozomi: Yeah, but compared to Kanna-san or Natsume-san's, my drinks are somewhat... off. It's hard to put my finger on what, but it's definitely missing something. Kousei: But it doesn't taste bad, does it? Nozomi: Most customers probably wouldn't have a problem with it... Nozomi: But I don't know if it'd be able to satisfy those customers who come specifically for a cup of coffee or tea. Kousei: Do we get a lot of those customers? Nozomi: Some days? We've been getting a lot more of them lately, though. They like to come in during the mornings or evenings when the cafe isn't as busy and just order a drink. Kousei: Guess I hadn't noticed since I don't handle drinks. Nozomi: They're nothing at all like our usual guests. Nozomi: It's like, whenever I take their orders, they're implicitly saying, \"I hear you make a mean cup of coffee. I'll be the judge of that!\" or something. Kousei: Sounds pretty pretentious. Nozomi: I'm not just imagining things, either. They really do act all snobby. Nozomi: That's why I've been meaning to practice more... but these customers don't make it easy. Kousei: Right. Nozomi: Okay, I'm good here. Thanks for walking me home. See you later! Kousei: See ya. "

Kanna: Hnghh! Mikado: Is something the matter? Kanna: No, it's nothing serious. You want to know something, though, Mikado-san? Mikado: What? Kanna: Kisses feels amazing. Mikado: I beg your pardon? Kanna: You know, kissing. I had no idea it would make me feel so hot. Even though it's not my first time anymore... it's sho amazing... Mikado: You had me quite confused at first. Well, I am glad that your relationship seems to be going well... Mikado: But how were things? Kanna: It's strange. Even though all we're doing is putting our lips together... it makes my entire body go numb, making it hard to even breathe, plus my head goes completely blank-- Mikado: I was not asking you to describe your impressions of kissing. Kanna: Wait! I know what you're thinking, but we didn't use any tongue! That would virtually be foreplay, and we haven't had sex yet, so-- Mikado: I was not inquiring about any of that, you nymphomanic excuse of a Grim Reaper. Kanna: You really need to stop calling me that. Mikado: I was merely asking you how Takamine Kousei was doing. Mikado: But I think I have heard all I need to hear. Mikado: Given how giddy you yourself are, it is clear as day how Takamine Kousei must be feeling. Kanna: Ahaha... Is it that obvious? Mikado: If he truly does make you that happy, is that not all the more reason to go all the way with him? Kanna: I mean, sure... I bet it feels wonderful... having sex with someone you truly love. Kanna: At least, I'm sure it would for me. Mikado: But not for him? Kanna: I'm afraid. If I were to be his first, and then disappear soon after... Mikado: ...... Kanna: Oh, that reminds me. You should start looking for a new employee. Kanna: After the New Year's holiday, we're going to be one waitress short. Mikado: Ah... So the time you have remaining is that scant? Kanna: Yes. I want to make him happy, make him smile. But at the same time... I don't want him to have a lingering attachment to me that becomes a burden to him. Kanna: That's why the most I could give him was an ordinary kiss. Kanna: Truth be told, it may have been better if we never even did that. Kanna: But I really do love him, so I just couldn't help myself... Mikado: That was a part of it, I'm sure. Mikado: But you allowed him to kiss you because you saw no problem with it, did you not? Kanna: Yes. I hadn't realized it myself, but now that you mention it... you're probably right. Kanna: I'm certain that Kousei-san will be fine. Mikado: If you can say that with such confidence, then you have nothing to worry about. Mikado: Should you choose to keep him at arm's length... you may well end up leaving him with even more regrets. Kanna: I appreciate your advice. Mikado: I look forward to seeing you all next year. Have a good night, everyone. Mikado: Make sure not to catch a cold under the kotatsu tonight. Everyone: Happy New Year! Mei: What are you doing for the New Year's holiday, Nozomi-chan? Nozomi: Helping out at home, most likely. It's the busiest time of the year for us at the shrine. Mei: Oh, that's right! I'll definitely come by to visit the shrine for New Year's. I can't wait to see your adorable shrine maiden outfit! Nozomi: Oh, stop. You're embarrassing me... Natsume: Have you got any special plans, Suzune-san? Suzune: Nope. I think I'm just gonna hibernate at home till January. Kousei: Hm? Aren't you going to get changed? Kanna: I can always get changed in my own room. But first, I wanted to ask you about your holiday plans. Kousei: Sure. I wanted to ask you what you were doing too. Kousei: How do Grim Reapers usually spend their New Year's? Do you have to drop by heaven and say hello to God or something? Kanna: No, nothing like that. Kanna: Actually, I was hoping I could spend it with you. What do you say we go on another date tomorrow? Kanna: There's someplace I'd like to go. Kousei: Fine by me. In fact, I'd love to. Kousei: Where are we going? Kanna: That's... a secret for now. Kousei: It's a surprise, huh? Kanna: More or less. Kanna: Let's meet at noon here, at the cafe... Oh, and make sure you don't eat lunch beforehand. Kousei: Alright. Noon it is. Kanna: Indeed. Kousei: I can't wait to see what you have in store for tomorrow. Kanna: ...... Kanna: You bet. I'll see you tomorrow. "

We have work tomorrow and the day after too. Suzune: Keep moping around, and it's going to start affecting your cake-making.

Suzune: Well, that's good. To be honest, I was worried I went a little too far... Kousei: Nah. Everything you said made sense, and I don't think you were being unreasonable either. Kousei: If anything, it was just what I needed to hear. I'm ready to turn over a new leaf today. Suzune: W-Well... Glad to hear it. Kousei: Y'know, it almost seems like you're the one who's down in the dumps today. Suzune: No, I just... Kousei: You don't need to worry about me. Kousei: You're the one who said our problems don't concern our customers, remember? Kousei: Let's just try and focus on making their Christmas an enjoyable one. To that end, feel free to work me as hard as you want today. Kousei: What do you say? Suzune: Huh. You know, you've got a surprising amount of mental fortitude. Or are you just an idiot? Suzune: Either way, I'm impressed at how quickly you managed to switch gears. Kousei: Are you insulting me? Suzune: It's a compliment. Suzune: I think it's a good thing. Much better than dwelling on the past. Kousei: Agreed. Suzune: Alright. Let's get down to work. Kousei: Is there any difference between a Yule Log and a Swiss Roll? Suzune: Hm? I guess the main difference is the appearance. Suzune: Though when it comes to Yule Logs, I tend to make the actual cake less sweet to balance out the sugar in the frosting. Kousei: Oh, okay. I thought so. Suzune: The cake is originally called buche de Noel in French, which literally means \"Christmas firewood\". Suzune: There are a few theories as to why it was made to resemble firewood specifically. Suzune: But personally, I think it became a popular Christmas dessert because of how easy it is to make at home with your family. Kousei: Make sense. In other countries, it's generally more common to spend Christmas with your family, after all. Kousei: In Japan, though, it's much more of a holiday for couples these days. Suzune: Nothing wrong with that. The original meaning of most holidays tends to warp over time no matter what. Kousei: True. Kousei: Incidentally, are you familiar with the period of time known as the \"six hours of sex,\" Suzune-san? Suzune: You mean the six hours between 9:00 PM on December 24th and 3:00 AM on December 25th, when the highest number of people in Japan are having sex? Suzune: Why the hell are you bringing that up? Are you trying to sexually harrass me? Kousei: No, of course not. Kousei: It's just... frustrating knowing that the cakes I'm making are being used as a tool to help other people get laid. Kousei: In fact, this cake I'm making right now might end up being used for that very purpose! Grrrr! Suzune: Whoa, geez. Chill out. Don't go pouring your resentment into our cakes! Suzune: You're gonna ruin the taste! Kousei: Sorry. Suzune: Instead of being so bitter about it, why don't you just find yourself a girlfriend? Kousei: If it were that easy, I would've lost my virginity years ago. Suzune: Hahaha. I guess that's true. Suzune: Hiroto's the same as you. I wish that kid would hurry up and find a girlfriend or two already. As his sister, I'm getting worried about him. Kousei: Incidentally, what do you think I'm lacking? Kousei: I've been told that I'm not proactive enough before. But besides that. Suzune: You? Hmm... Suzune: Personality-wise... I wouldn't say you have any particular problems either. Suzune: Hmm... I'm sure a guy like you can find yourself a girl eventually. Maybe. Kousei: You could at least try to sound a little more confident. Kousei: This is a serious concern of mine, I'll have you know. Suzune: I don't know what to tell you... Kousei: Let's say you were dating me, for example. What would you say I need to improve? Suzune: Me? Dating YOU? Kousei: You don't need to sound THAT disgusted. It kinda hurts. Suzune: I mean, come on... You're the same age as my little brother. Kousei: I might be younger than you, but I am still a man. Are you saying I'm too much of a kid? Kousei: I mean, I guess I'm not surprised you'd think that. You've had to teach me a lot ever since we started working together. Kousei: Hm? Suzune: Not weird, per se... Suzune: But there was that time you pushed me down on the bed. Kousei: Wait, time out! Why'd you have to phrase it like that?! Kousei: That was 100\\% an accident! Suzune: I know! I'm not angry about it or anything... Suzune: I'm just saying, like, back then... I couldn't move at all with you on top of me. Suzune: And I couldn't really ignore your, um... masculine features. Kousei: O-Oh... right... Nozomi: You pushed her down on the bed?! Kousei: Nozomi?! When did you get here?! Mei: Then climbed on top of her too?! Suzune: Mei-san?! Kanna: Oh. So you did it in the missionary position, I assume? Natsume: What are you saying, Akizuki-san? Kanna: Oh, I'm sorry. You're right. Kanna: It could've easily been the prone bone position as well. Natsume: That's NOT what I meant! Natsume: And you two! It's none of my business what you get up to on your own time, but this is hardly the proper place to be discussing your s-sex life... Suzune: We weren't! We absolutely were NOT talking about that! Suzune: I'm still a pure, untarnished virgin! Kousei: So am I! Mei: S-Senpai... I didn't know you had those sorts of fetishes. Nozomi: Ahh, ahhhhhhh! I have to tell Mom about this! Kousei: Don't! That's fake news! Kousei: I just meant I don't have any sexual experience yet either! I'm a virgin! Suzune: And first of all, Kousei and I aren't even dating! Kousei: Yeah! It was an accident we were talking about earlier! I just tripped and knocked her over! Suzune: What he said! Nozomi: Ohh. Well, why didn't you say so? Mei: Phew. That gave me a fright. Kousei: I'M the one who should be saying that. Suzune: Honestly! Give me a break... Natsume: Now that we've cleared that up, let's get back to preparing to open for the day, shall we? Kanna: Good idea. Suzune: ...... Kousei: ...... Suzune: We should get back to work too. Kousei: Yeah. "

            "Natsume: Huh. So even the convenience store varieties have differences between them. Kousei: They all taste pretty damn good, though. Kousei: And they're all mostly under 200 yen too... Natsume: Speaking of which, we should also decide how much we're going to sell ours for. We should pick a nice, round number. That way it'll be easier to make change. Kousei: How about 500 yen per bun? Natsume: Even for a street stall, that's a bit too expensive, don't you think? Kousei: Yeah, I guess so. How about 200 or 300 yen each then? No one would complain about that. Natsume: I agree. Natsume: However, what if we sell them for 100 yen each, but make each bun smaller to compensate? Kousei: Hmm. That's not a bad idea. Natsume: Anyway, back on the topic of taste. What did you think of them all? Which one is your favorite? Kousei: I'm not really picky as long as it tastes good, but personally, I guess I prefer the ones with more umami. Kousei: But I do like a bit of sweetness in the dough too. Kousei: That's just me, though. Natsume: There's nothing wrong with that. One of us has to make the decision, either way. Kousei: Well, alright. Kousei: Sorry. Do you mind if I use your restroom? Natsume: Oh, sure. It's that door over there. Kousei: Thanks. Kousei: I'm managing to converse with her normally, right? I hope I'm not being creepy... Kousei: ...... Kousei: Damn it. Every little thing's starting to make my heart race now... Kousei: Bah. She's gonna get suspicious if I take too long. I'd better hurry up and get back. Natsume: ...... Natsume: Ahhhhhhh! We shared an indirect kiss... Natsume: Stupid, stupid, stupid! Agh! Natsume: How much of an idiot am I?! If only we'd bought two of each, this never would have happened... Natsume: Why'd I tell him to only buy one?! Natsume: Actually, we could've just split them in half! Why didn't I think of that sooner?! God, I'm such an idiot... Natsume: *sigh*... My heart's still racing. Natsume: This shouldn't be bothering me at all... But we did indirectly kiss each other... Natsume: ...... Natsume: Ngh... Nghhhhhh! Kousei: Sorry, I'm back. Natsume: You're fine. Kousei: Alright. Sounds good to me. Kousei: But if you need any help, let me know. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but that doesn't mean I want to leave all the work to you either. Natsume: I know. Thanks. Kousei: Now we just need someone to make them... and someone to be our salesgirl. Natsume: Urk... Kousei: Someone to make the buns, carry them from the cafe, and reheat them at the stall. And someone to attract customers too... Natsume: Actually, um, about that... Kousei: Hm? Natsume: ...... Kousei: Wh-What? You're scaring me. Kousei: Why are you randomly glaring at me? Did I say something to upset you? Natsume: No. I'm not upset. Kousei: Okay... then what? Natsume: Wait here for a minute. Kousei: Is she not going to the restroom? Why the bathroom? Kousei: I don't get it. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Because there's a girl in a qipao in front of me? Natsume: Hello, officer? Kousei: Wait! Seriously, wait! I'm sorry! Kousei: You just looked so cute that my fingers reflexively moved towards the camera button! I couldn't help it! Kousei: I'll delete it, okay?! There, it's gone! See? See?! Natsume: Tch... Kousei: Sorry. I should've asked permission first. Kousei: But, all jokes aside... Kousei: Why are you wearing that outfit? Natsume: To give you the first look. Kousei: ...... Natsume: Don't look at me like I'm some freak! You're the one who said I should wear a China dress to sell Chinese buns. Kousei: I never said that. At least, not aloud. Natsume: But you were definitely thinking it. Don't lie. Kousei: Well... okay. Kousei: So that's why you're wearing that outfit. But where'd you buy it from anyway? Natsume: I bought it at the mall earlier, when we split up... Kousei: Ohh... Natsume: You know what? I'm changing out of this. Kousei: Wait, wait! I don't think it's weird at all! Kousei: In fact, it looks really good on you! You look cute! Ridiculously cute! Also, kinda sexy! Natsume: You're not changing my mind! Kousei: Why?! I was complimenting you! What, did I say something I shouldn't have? Natsume: It's just embarrassing... being called s-sexy, and all that other stuff... Kousei: I didn't mean it in a weird way. I just meant it as a compliment. Kousei: It's the only word I can think of to describe my feelings right now... but I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable. Kousei: Anyway, it's cute. You look great in it. It's gonna attract a lot of customers, that's for sure. Natsume: Nrghhhhhhhhh! Kousei: And you're still glaring at me... Natsume: It's not you, it's just this dress. The hem is so short, and the slits are so deep too. You can't see my pantyline, can you? Kousei: Not from this angle, at least... Kousei: But just to be sure... could you, uh, turn around for me? Natsume: Not a chance in hell. Kousei: Sorry. I'm kidding. Kousei: Anyway, I can't see anything from where I am, so I think you should be safe. Natsume: Well, fine. But maybe I should look for one that's a bit less revealing... Kousei: This qipao, and that maid outfit--you look good in just about anything, Shiki-san. Kousei: And I mean that as a genuine compliment. But seriously; what brought all this on? Kousei: You look great, and I'm sure you'd draw a lot of customers with that dress... but I thought you were against the idea of wearing one? Natsume: I still am. It's embarrassing... plus you keep giving me creepy compliments... Kousei: I wasn't trying to be creepy, honestly. I'm just not used to complimenting people... so it was a poor choice of words. Natsume: To be honest, I'm still not too thrilled about the idea. Natsume: But you want our stall to be a success, don't you? And me wearing this outfit will help. Kousei: So... you're gonna wear it? Natsume: As long as you don't think it looks weird... sure. Kousei: I really don't. You look adorable. It'll have a massive impact on our sales. Natsume: Alright... fine. I'll do it. Kousei: Thanks. I... really appreciate it. Natsume: You and your cosplay fetish. Kousei: No, all I mean is I'm happy you're willing to do all this for me. Kousei: I'm grateful. Really. Natsume: Whatever. You shouldn't thank me just yet anyway. We've still got a lot of work ahead of us. Kousei: True. Kousei: But I'm confident we'll make it a success. With how hard you're working, there's no way we'll fail. Natsume: I hope so. But, urgh... this thing is really short. Natsume: Anyway, now that you've gotten a good look, I'm going to get changed. This is too embarrassing... Kousei: That's actual criminal behavior right there. Kousei: But now that I think about it... I've made tons of progress. Kousei: I guess that about wraps everything up. Kousei: I'm gonna get going now. Natsume: Oh, okay. Thanks for coming today. Have a good night. Kousei: Mhm. Night. Kousei: Phew... Kousei: God, that was nerve-wracking. Not only did she invite me into her apartment, she even put on that qipao to specifically show me... Kousei: ...... Kousei: But seriously, she looked absolutely stunning in that dress... Kousei: Anyway, I'd better fill Suzune-san in on the details. Guess I'll drop by the cafe before going home. Natsume: *sigh* Natsume: Let's look up some recipes for meat buns instead. "

Suzune: I'm hoping we get a lot of customers too, but let's not bite off more than we can chew. Suzune: No matter how much we've practiced things, the real deal won't be the same. Kousei: Still, we've reached over 500 followers on Instogram now, so I'd say we've garnered some attention. Mikado: Is that high? Kousei: Well, Hiuchidani-san said it was pretty amazing. It has only been less than a month since we started, and we've only just opened. Mikado: I see. In that case, perhaps we can raise our expectations a little.

I must say, I did not expect so many people to appreciate my sophistication. Suzune: Even so, our followers could be from anywhere around the globe. There's no guaranteeing they all live in the area.

Suzune: I just know how cruel reality can be from personal experience, so I guess I've gotten into the habit of thinking pragmatically. Sorry. Natsume: You don't have to apologize for that. You made a valid point. Natsume: Reality can certainly be unforgiving. But that's why we need to be focused on putting a smile on the face of everyone who walks through our door! Natsume: Once we can do that, people will be lining up outside our cafe in no time at all. Suzune: Yeah, that's exactly what I was trying to say! Kousei: Feels like you're just piggybacking on what she said, though. Suzune: Look, I'm just trying to pep everyone up! Mikado: In any case, both Sumizome-kun and Hiuchidani-kun have classes all morning, so we will be somewhat short-staffed for the time being. Best to keep that in mind. Kousei: Right.

Kanna: And having said that, I am very happy to be dating you as well. However, I think it's important that we set down a few guidelines. Kousei: Good idea. Suzune-san might seriously get angry with us if we keep this up everyday. Kanna: Right. So let's decide on some ground rules first. Kousei: I guess the most important rule should be to prioritize our jobs while at work, including our morning prep and after-closing cleanup. Kousei: I know we can both agree on that much... but is there anything else you'd like to add, Kanna? Kanna: This is the first time you've ever dated a girl, isn't it? Kousei: Yeah. Why? Kanna: It's my first relationship too, so, to be perfectly honest, I have no idea how to actually \"date\", either. Kanna: Thus I'm worried that even though we see each other every day, we might not necessarily be spending that time as a couple. Kanna: So I was thinking... we could agree to set aside a certain amount of time when we can be together, just the two of us. Kousei: Yeah, that sounds good. I think that'd help me focus more while I'm at work too. Kanna: Okay. Why don't we make some time in the mornings before work to spend together? Kousei: The morning? Kanna: Is that a problem? Kousei: Well, not per se... but honestly, I don't know if I can wake up any earlier than I already do. Kanna: I thought you said you loved me. Is that all your \"love\" really amounts to? Kousei: Urk... No, I really do love you, I do, but... Kanna: But? Kousei: If I wake up any earlier than I do now, I'd be waking up before sunrise... so I'm not sure I'd be able to fully enjoy our time together. Kanna: ...... Kanna: Pfft. I'm only kidding. Nihihi. Kanna: To be honest, I'm not very good at waking up early either. If we want to spend time together, after work would be best. Kousei: Starting today... right? Kanna: Of course. Kousei: Alright. Any other rules we should decide on? Kanna: Hmm... I'm sure we'll think of more, the more time we spend with each other, so let's just cross that bridge when we get to it. Nozomi & Mei: Have a good night! Nozomi: The holiday season really is an absolute nightmare. Mei: Yeah. I'm about ready to pass out. Nozomi: At least we made it through Christmas. Mei: Yeah. We sold tons of cakes, and our customers all seemed super satisfied too. I think it's safe to say today was a success. Nozomi: Yep. Good job hanging in there, Mei-chan. Mei: You too, Nozomi-chan. Nozomi: Phew... Oh, I almost forgot. We'd better clean up before we get distracted. Suzune: Hold up. Before you go do that... Mei: Huh? What's that cake for? Nozomi: That's... not a leftover cake, is it? I thought we sold out today. Suzune: We did. This one's for us, though. Natsume: Even if we're working, it is still Christmas. We deserve to taste a bit of holiday cheer too. Mei: Is this really okay? Suzune: Of course. That's what I baked it for. Nozomi: But... won't you get in trouble for using ingredients without permission? Mikado: Hrmm. Mikado: I suppose it is fine every once in a while. Mei: Woohoo! Mikado: I must go see to the day's accounts. Try not to let your celebrations get out of hand. No doubt your families would be worried if you were to get home too late. Nozomi: Aren't you going to join us, Mikado-san? Mikado: I am not very fond of sweet desserts. Do not mind me, though. Go ahead and enjoy yourselves. Nozomi: Oh... Well, okay. Nozomi: Thanks for letting us do this, though. Natsume: He's right, though. We've still got to clean up, so we can't drag this out for too long. Suzune: Plus, we've got a couple of us here who are just dying to get out of here so they can spend some alone time on Christmas. Natsume: Very true. Mei: Oh, yeah. I hadn't thought of that. Nozomi: We wouldn't want to keep them. Ehehe. Kanna: ...... Kousei: That's okay. You don't have to-- Natsume: Come on. No need to beat around the bush. Nozomi: What she said, Kousei-kun. At times like this, it's best to be upfront with your desires. Mei: Yeah. Don't lie to yourself, Senpai! Kousei: Well, obviously we'd like to spend some time alone. Kousei: But we've already made those arrangements. Nozomi: Oh? That's unexpected. Kanna: You don't have to worry so much about us. Kanna: Enough of that--let's all have some cake! Mei: Don't mind if I do! Everyone: Merry Christmas, everyone! Kousei: Pardon me. Kanna: Yeah. I doubt there are many places open this late anyway. Kanna: Besides, it's a TGIF Christmas. Anywhere still open is bound to be completely full. Kousei: ...... Kanna: Hm? What's the matter? Kousei: TGIF? Kousei: Oh, I remember now. That's supposed to mean \"Thank God it's Friday,\" right? Kanna: Huh? Wait... Ah! Kanna: Urk... Kousei: You really do talk like a boomer, Kanna. Kanna: S-So what if the slang I use is a bit outdated? You still understood me, didn't you? Isn't that all that matters? Kousei: Took me a second, though. Kanna: Urk... Kousei: But yeah, it is a TGIF Christmas. I'm sure everyone's out there celebrating the end of the workweek, so it'll probably be crowded anywhere we go. Kanna: Why do you always make fun of me... Kousei: I'm not. It does kind of have a nice ring to it. TGIF Christmas. Kanna: Shut up. Kanna: I've got my own smartphone now. If you think I'm going to be stuck an out-of-touch boomer forever, then you've got another think coming! Kousei: Oh, come on. I never called you out-of-touch. But speaking of which-- Kousei: How's the phone going for you? Having any problems? Kanna: Not particularly. That being said, I only use it for a select few things. Kanna: Not that I regret buying it, though! I'm having a lot of fun using it to take pictures. Kousei: Oh, yeah. I noticed you using it today to take pictures of the cake Suzune-san made for us. Kanna: Would you like to see them? Kanna: Here! What do you think? They turned out quite well, if I do say so myself. Also, I've got some more too. Kousei: You're right. It looks delicious. Kousei: I-I really like this photo. The timing of the shot is pretty amazing. Kanna: Hehehe. What you're witnessing is the result of my daily progress. Kousei: Yeah, it was great. This was the first Christmas I've ever spent like that. Kousei: Well, when I was a kid, I'd either celebrate it at Nozomi's house or on my own. Kousei: These days, I guess I usually just celebrate with other guy friends. Which is still pretty fun, in its own way. Kousei: But because of that... Kanna: Hm? Kousei: Truth be told, I have no idea how I should celebrate Christmas with a girlfriend. Kanna: Well, you're not the only one. I have no clue what we're supposed to do either. Kanna: But we can just do whatever we're comfortable with, right? I don't think there's any need to copy what other people do.  Kousei: Yeah... I guess you're right. Kousei: This is only our second day dating, after all. It wouldn't make sense to compare ourselves to... other couples. Kanna: Exactly. If we wanted to do what everyone else was, then we'd be... Kanna: ...... Kousei: Ah. You were thinking about something sexual, weren't you? Kanna: No, I was no--well... I guess I can't deny it. Kanna: We are in fact a couple now. Kousei: Yeah, we are. It's only natural to think about those sorts of things... when you start dating someone. Kousei: I'd be lying if I said I wasn't having those thoughts either. Kousei: You don't want to? Kanna: Well. I think we should sit down and discuss this, first and foremost. Kousei: Discuss... what? Kanna: How do I say this... It... scares me, I think. Kousei: That's understandable. It's not easy for girls. Kanna: No, that's not what I mean. Urgh, how to best explain this... Kanna: I want to see you smiling while we're going out together, Kousei-san. And even when we have to part ways, I want you to be happy. Kanna: But... Kousei: You think it won't be in my best interest? Kanna: At the very least, I'm not confident it'll be a pleasant experience for you, since I'm a virgin. Kousei: I mean... I don't have any confidence in that area either. Kanna: I've just heard countless horror stories about people's first sexual experiences. Kousei: Well... Yeah, I'm sure you can find plenty of stories like that if you look for them. Kanna: So, well... hmm... what I'm trying to say is, like... Kanna: I'm just worried about... what kind of impression I'm going to leave you with, Kousei-san. Kousei: ...... Kanna: That being said... a part of me is scared about losing my virginity too, plain and simple. Kousei: Yeah, I get it. Kousei: Sort of. Kinda. Kanna: You do or you don't? Kousei: I can't say I can empathize with you completely. Kousei: But I do at least understand where you're coming from. Kousei: Basically... you're worried about the limited amount of time we have together. Kousei: If it ends up being a bad experience, that could sully the memories of our time together that I'm left with after you're gone. Kanna: Yes, exactly. Kousei: Then the answer's simple: we'll just make tons and tons of happy memories. Kousei: That way, even if there are a few unpleasant ones in the mix, I'll still be able to look back on them fondly. Kousei: Still, I can understand why you'd feel anxious jumping straight into it. Kousei: In that case--why don't we start with something like a picture? A picture of the two of us, using your phone. Kanna: Oh, I like that idea! Let's do it. Kanna: Hmm... I believe this is called a \"selfie,\" right? I turn on the front-facing camera, stretch out my arm... Come on, you need to get closer or you'll be cut out of frame. Kousei: R-Right. Kanna: Alright, I'm taking it. Say cheese! Kanna: Ah! D-Don't tell me that was boomer lingo too?! Do people even still say cheese nowadays?! Kousei: I-I dunno. I guess? Kousei: To be honest, I don't get my picture taken very often. There might be other things people say, but I can't really think of anything else at the moment... Kanna: Well, that's fine... Kanna: Okay, I'm taking the picture for real this time. Say cheese! Kanna: It's gotten rather late, hasn't it? Are you sure you'll be able to wake up in time for work tomorrow? Kousei: Yeah. I'm gonna go straight to bed once I get back. Kanna: Good idea. Make sure to keep yourself warm so you don't catch a cold. Kanna: Also, please be careful on your way home. Kousei: I will. Kousei: Oh, I almost forgot. Thanks for the gloves. They're super warm. Kanna: You're very welcome. Kousei: Well then-- Kousei: ...... Kanna: Hmm? Kousei-san? Kousei: Kanna... Kanna: Yes? Kousei: May I, um... give you a kiss? Kanna: ...... Kousei: Err, I'm not trying to bring up our discussion from earlier again. Kousei: It would be our first kiss... so it's probably going to leave a pretty strong impression, I know. Kousei: But since it's just a kiss, I don't think there's much risk of it going wrong or being an unpleasant experience, so... Kousei: Pretty please? That's not too much to ask from my girlfriend, is it? Kanna: H-Hrmm... Well... If you want to kiss THAT badly... Kanna: After much deliberation, I suppose a kiss would be... acceptable. Kousei: Alright then. Kanna: Umm... What exactly does a kiss feel like? Kousei: I wouldn't know. Kanna: You don't have to answer so bluntly... Kousei: I mean, we'll find out for ourselves either way. Kanna: Well, I get that, but still. Kousei: It's probably not that big of a deal. Kanna: Y-Yeah. All we're essentially doing is putting our lips together. Kanna: That's all it is... right? Kousei: ...... Kanna: Nhh! Nhh... mhh... Kousei: Ngh... Kousei: *pant* *pant*... Kanna: I mean... it would've been embarrassing to breathe all over you... Kousei: Yeah, that would've been... Yeah. Kousei: It was... kind of amazing. Kousei: What did you think? Kanna: I agree. It was... kind of amazing. Kanna: So amazing that... Kanna: Ahmph... Nh, mhh... Kanna: Ahmph, mhh... Nh, nhh... Kousei: D-Did you just... Kanna: ...... Kanna: I'm... going back inside. See you tomorrow. Kousei: Y-Yeah, see you. "

            "Kousei: Hey, Nozomi... Can we go to your place? Nozomi: What? No, we can't... You and I aren't kids anymore. I mean, it'd be awkward... and embarrassing... Kousei: Then can you at least do me a favor and delete those recordings? Nozomi: What? I could never do that. They're precious memories to me. Kousei: You used to be such a sweet, obedient little girl. Kousei: When did you become such a rebellious young girl? You're gonna make Onii-chan cry! Nozomi: If my personality's gone rotten, I think we both know you're to blame. Kousei: Err... I can't exactly deny that. Nozomi: Maybe you should at least try to. Kousei: Well, I know your mom and dad are both good, nice people, so it couldn't be their fault. Nozomi: Nice to you, maybe... All they ever do to me is nag, nag, nag. Kousei: Speaking of that, umm--about those recordings. Nozomi: Yeah, I know. I was just kidding. If the idea of me holding onto those bothers you so much, I'll delete them. And I'll try not to sing those songs anymore, either. Kousei: Seriously? Nozomi: I'm gonna miss those little pieces of our childhood... but I'll be fine! I've already memorized the lyrics anyway. Kousei: Are you kidding me?! Nozomi: Aww, I'm just kidding! Your songs were way too wacky for me to memorize. Kousei: I'm not exactly sure how to feel about that. Nozomi: You're hard to please. Nozomi: Anyway, I'll delete them. Kousei: Thanks. Nozomi: Now, let's hurry up and eat. I'm starving. Kousei: Thanks for the food. Nozomi: Dig in. Nozomi: How's it taste? Kousei: Great. No complaints. Nozomi: Glad you like it. Kousei: I feel kinda bad about making you fix breakfast for me all the time, though... Nozomi: I don't mind. Nozomi: Mom and Dad prefer toast for breakfast, but I like rice, so that creates a bit of a problem. Kousei: Oh, right. Nozomi: Do you ever feel like having toast instead, Kousei-kun? I'm not forcing my preferences on you... am I? Kousei: I would've told you to stop coming if that were the case. Kousei: You make great food, so I've got zero complaints. It's much appreciated. Thank you very much. Nozomi: Heh. Keep showering me in praise! Kousei: These rolled omelets are especially good. Nozomi: I meant me, not the food... Nozomi: Well, whatever. I guess I should know better than to expect a guy like you to be able to compliment a girl. Kousei: Excuse you? I'm the most honest, open guy you'll ever find. Remember back when we were kids? I'd always-- Nozomi: Mhh! These salmon fillets are perfect! I nailed the seasoning today! Kousei: Will you listen to me? Nozomi: Oh, right! I almost forgot; Dad wanted me to tell you something. Kousei: Your dad did? Kousei: Wait, don't tell me... Nozomi: Judging from the look on your face, I think you've already figured it out. Kousei: It's about my rent, isn't it? Nozomi: Bingo. Since you chose the correct answer, you get a prize! Your prize is: paying rent! Kousei: Just out of curiosity, how many months has it been? Nozomi: As of today: four months. Kousei: My old man's done it again... Nozomi: Mr. Kazufumi hasn't been in tocuh with you either, Kousei-kun? Kousei: Nope. We don't talk very often in the first place. I haven't the foggiest idea where he is right now or what he's up to... Nozomi: When's that gonna be, though? You still haven't found a new job, have you? Kousei: Err, well, about that, actually. Nozomi: I know. You don't have to say it. Kousei: Wait, I can explain! I really am looking for one! And I didn't quit my job at the convenience store 'cause I wanted to, okay? If my manager wasn't such an asshole... Kousei: I told him a month in advance I'd need time off to study for exams, but what did he do? Schedule me shift after shift, tell me I need to find someone to cover my shifts if I want time off. And he has the gall to lecture ME about responsibility? Nozomi: This is the same guy that accused you of stealing money from the cash register and took it out of your paycheck, right? Nozomi: You've already told me plenty about how crappy it was there. Kousei: Right. Nozomi: And you've been looking for a new job ever since, but haven't been able to find one. Kousei: Yeah... Nozomi: You're a worthless bum, aint'cha? Kousei: I know... And don't forget to add \"waste-of-space\" and \"good-for-nothing\" to the list too. Nozomi: Seriously, though. What're you gonna do? Nozomi: What? Kousei: Wanna get married? Nozomi: Kousei-kun... I don't know how to respond to that. Marriage is a big deal, you know? Why are you bringing this up so randomly... Kousei: I want to drink your miso soup every morning... Nozomi: You basically already do. Kousei: But I wanna be a lazy bastard who does nothing all day long. I want to marry into money so you can support my lifestyle... Pretty please? Nozomi: You're being way too bold with this proposal... My heart's gonna skip a beat... Kousei: I'll work hard. I'll be the best gigolo the world's ever seen, I promise... So will you take me, Nozomi? Nozomi: Oh, gosh... No one's ever confessed to me before... And to be a gigolo, of all things... Nozomi: Well, I'll ask Mom what she thinks about it first. Kousei: Wait, hold up. Don't do that, please? I don't want her getting the wrong idea. Nozomi: All joking aside--you're not actually planning on becoming a gigolo, are you? That's kind of gross, you know... Kousei: No, I'm not. I'll work to support myself. Nozomi: Well, good. Kousei: I promise I'll pay the rent; I just need some time. Again, I'm really sorry about this. Nozomi: Relax, I was just playing along with the joke. I don't think Dad's that worried about the rent. He knows your dad will pay once he gets ahold of him. Nozomi: What I'm worried about is your lifestyle, though. Are you able to eat enough without any income? Kousei: Yeah, I am. Nozomi: He says you're welcome to stay over anytime. Kousei: Thanks... I'll take him up on that if I run out of options. Nozomi: Still, I think he'd feel a lot better if you dropped by and said hello. Kousei: I will. I'll come by soon and explain things to him. Nozomi: Good. Kousei: Alright. Thanks for breakfast. Nozomi: You're welcome. Nozomi: Don't hesitate to come talk to me if you're having money problems. I know you probably don't feel comfortable asking Dad for help, but I'm always willing to. I have a bit of money saved up myself. Kousei: I can't ask you to lend me money. That's just plain shameless. Nozomi: Oh, really? Didn't you just ask me to marry you so you didn't have to work? Kousei: Come on, you know I was just joking. Kousei: I appreciate the sentiment, but I'm not gonna take your money. Kousei: You already help me out more than enough by cooking me breakfast every day. So thanks for that. Nozomi: Mhm. Kousei: Actually, shouldn't you probably head out soon? Nozomi: Oh, gosh! I didn't know it was this late already. Kousei: I'll take care of the clean up. Nozomi: Really? Thanks. Kousei: No problem. It's the least I can do. Kousei: You already did the work of cooking this. Plus, this is my apartment. Nozomi: Alright. I'm gonna get going then. Nozomi: You need to hear that more than me. Make sure you leave on time, okay? Nozomi: See you later! Kousei: Have fun at school. And watch out for cars. Kousei: Guess I better start getting ready for class. Hiroto: Oh, look who it is! You coming to campus too, Kousei? Kousei: Oh. Hey, Hiroto. Hiroto: Guess you didn't check your email. Professor Komatsu can't come in today, so class is cancelled. Kousei: Seriously? Damn, I rushed on over here for nothing. Hiroto: Maybe. Seems like they wrote it in a hurry this morning. But either way, that means we've got some free time on our hands. Kousei: Yeah. Guess we better find some place to kill some time at. Hiroto: Why don't we chill in the cafeteria for a bit? Kousei: Sounds fine to me. Hiroto: Wanna grab a bite to eat while we're at it? Kousei: They're not open this early, are they? Hiroto: We got that convenience store next door, though. Kousei: Nah, I'm good. I had breakfast before I came. Hiroto: Alright. Guess I'll get myself a coffee then... You want one too? Kousei: If you're paying. Hiroto: Sure, why not? I'm in a good mood today. Kousei: Oh, sweet. I guess I'll take one. Hiroto: Gotcha. Milk and sugar? Kousei: Nope. Make it black. Hiroto: Are you for real, man?! Kousei: *sip*... Phew... Hiroto: ...... Kousei: What? Hiroto: Is that not, like, really bitter? Kousei: Well, of course it is. It's coffee. Hiroto: That doesn't mean you gotta drink it without any sugar or anything. You trying to act sophisticated or something? Kousei: Nah, I just don't really like sugar in my coffee. Makes the acidity more pronounced. Hiroto: Does it? Can't say I've ever noticed. Hiroto: Mind if I take a sip? Kousei: Go ahead. You paid for it. Kousei: What are you doing? Hiroto: Thanks, man. Kousei: No problem. Hiroto: Here's your coffee back. I don't know how the hell you can drink this bitter crap. Kousei: I just don't like really acidic coffee, personally. Hiroto: Different strokes for different folks, I guess. Hiroto: But man, I wasted all my coffee. Maybe I used up all my luck yesterday. Kousei: Come to think of it, you did say you're in a good mood. Kousei: Did you win big at mahjong or something? Hiroto: Hell yeah. In the final round, I managed to turn the game around with a riichi, ippatsu, pinfu, junchan, sanshoku, iipeikou, and triple dora! And you bet your ass I declared riichi there! Kousei: Dang. Hiroto: Interested in mahjong, Kousei? You should play with me sometime. It's fun. Kousei: Sure, when I have the time to. Right now, my top priority is finding a job. Hiroto: Your last job was at that convenience store, right? I remember you telling me about how you quit 'cause of your douchebag manager. Kousei: Do you know any good-paying places that are hiring? And brainless work, preferably. Hiroto: Yeah, right. I'd be working there myself, if I did. Kousei: True. Guess I gotta find one myself the old-fashioned way. Hiroto: Finding something part-time's important, but don't forget we gotta start doing real job hunting next year. Kousei: Yeah... Hiroto: What's your plan? Any particular field you wanna work in? Kousei: No clue. The whole idea of a \"real-world\" job still feels kinda foreign to me. Hiroto: I know what ya mean. I dunno what I wanna do either... Kousei: Well, not like you're gonna get any useful advice out of me. Don't you know someone who's a working adult? Ask them. Hiroto: Huh? Who are you--wait... you aren't talking about my sister, are you? Kousei: What're you grimacing at me for? I thought you were on relatively good terms. Hiroto: I mean, sure, I don't hate her or anything. Hiroto: But she's always bossed me around, stealing my drinks and snacks for about as long as I can remember... Pretty much the last person I'd go to for real help. Kousei: Even though you're siblings? Hiroto: Because we're siblings. I know for a fact she'd just laugh and tease me for it. Hiroto: And it's not like she'd be much help even if she did decide to take me seriously. She's always known what she wanted to do when she grew up. Kousei: She's a pastry chef, isn't she? Hiroto: If she hasn't changed jobs, then yeah. Hiroto: You're probably more up-to-date with her life than me, though, to be honest. Kousei: What? Why would I be? Hiroto: You live in the same apartment complex as her. Heck, I've barely even seen her since she moved out. Kousei: Really? Hiroto: She does come home to visit for New Year's, but that's pretty much it. Hiroto: That time you and I went to say hi, I hadn't seen her in half a year. Kousei: Well, I haven't heard anything about a tenant being found dead, so I guess... Just because we live in the same complex doesn't mean I actually see her. Kousei: Are you concerned about her or something? Hiroto: Not particularly myself... But our mom's a bit worried. Hiroto: Apparently she's been sounding kinda tense over the phone, lately, so she thinks she might be stressed out or something. Kousei: Is that not reason enough for you to check up on her then? Hiroto: Maybe, but I really don't wanna see her. She'll just boss me around like always. Kousei: She seemed like a nice person to me, though. Hiroto: That's just what she wants you to think, man. She's a real tyrant around people she knows. Brash and brazen as hell.  Kousei: Damn, you're savage. Hiroto: Most siblings are that way when they're close in age. Kousei: Well, I'm an only child, so honestly, I'm a little jealous. Hiroto: You shouldn't be. I'd gladly switch places with you. Being bossed around your whole life sucks, I tell you. Hiroto: But anyway, if you see her, do me a favor and let her know our mom's worried about her. Kousei: Sure, I'll try. I think our schedules are pretty different, though, so no guarantees. Hiroto: All good. It's probably nothing serious, honestly. Hiroto: If it were, my mom would've gone over there herself. Kousei: Yeah. Kousei: Well, I hope she's doing alright. Being a working adult must be pretty stressful... Kousei: Speaking of which, weren't you doing an internship somewhere? Hiroto: Yeah, for a bit. What about you? Kousei: I did something similar. Didn't really feel like the right fit for me, though. Hiroto: I know what you mean. Internships are kinda pointless if you don't have a clear idea of what sort of work you wanna do. Kousei: Yeah. Hiroto: *sigh*... If only I could stay in school forever and not have to worry about getting a job. Kousei: Have you thought about going to graduate school? Hiroto: That's not what I'm talking about, man. Kousei: Personally, I just wanna have a nice, normal life... Get a job, make a living, find a girlfriend, get married, have kids, and build a happy family. Hiroto: Yeah, but honestly, even something as \"normal\" as that feels impossible to achieve nowadays. Kousei: I know what you mean... Hiroto: Who's to say we'll even be able to find a decent job? Kousei: Yeah... Hiroto: And forget marriage--I'm not even confident I'll able to get myself a girlfriend... Kousei: That might be more of a challenge than finding a job, honestly. Hiroto: You can say that again. Hiroto: At the very least, I just hope I can lose my virginity before I graduate. Kousei: I remember when I thought I'd lose my virginity before I hit twenty. Those were the days. Hiroto: Same. Hiroto: It just keeps getting further and further away, man. Kousei: I know what you mean. Hiroto: Well, worst case scenario--I can always go into porn. Kousei: Well, damn. Good luck with that. Hiroto: Yeah, thanks. Kousei: C'mon, let's get off this topic. You're killing my mood. Hiroto: Sure thing. Here's to... Actually, nevermind. I don't have any coffee left. Kousei: Yeah, you spilled the whole damn thing. Hiroto: Well, shit... I kinda want some, but not enough to buy another cup. Kousei: I could buy you one. Hiroto: You sure? Kousei: You paid for mine, so it's the least I can do. No biggie. Hiroto: Alright then. Ah--and don't forget to put a bunch of sugar in it, okay? Kousei: Yeah, I will. Hiroto: Oh, and make sure you put the sugar in the cup first before pouring in the coffee. Kousei: Geez. Anything else, Your Highness? Hiroto: Trust me, it tastes better that way. Plus it saves you the work of having to stir it. Kousei: Yeah, okay. Kousei: One small coffee, please. Store Clerk: That'll be 100 yen. Kousei: Here. Store Clerk: Thank you, and have a good day. Kousei: You too. Girl: A small coffee, please. Store Clerk: That'll be 100 yen. Thank you, and have a good day. Girl: Hm? Kousei: Um, you can go ahead. I have to put some sugar in mine first. Girl: Oh, okay. Excuse me. Natsume: Ah! Natsume: I want to ask you something. Natsume: Is it normal for the coffee here to taste super bitter? Kousei: Yeah, I think so. Natsume: Are you sure the machine isn't just broken? It took a while for the liquid to start coming out... Kousei: No, that's normal too. The machine didn't sound like it was acting up, either. Natsume: Oh... Natsume: Well, thanks for the help. Kousei: You're welcome. "

            "Suzune: I think you're expecting a bit too much. Kanna: Am I, though? I wouldn't be surprised if there was considering the quality of your madeleines, Suzune-san. Suzune: I'm flattered, but I doubt anyone's waiting in line for us to open. We're not offering any limited-time promotions or anything. Suzune: I'm hoping we get a lot of customers too, but let's not bite off more than we can chew. Suzune: No matter how much we've practiced things, the real deal won't be the same. Kousei: Still, we've reached over 500 followers on Instogram now, so I'd say we've garnered some attention. Mikado: Is that high? Kousei: Well, Hiuchidani-san said it was pretty amazing. It has only been less than a month since we started, and we've only just opened. Mikado: I see. In that case, perhaps we can raise our expectations a little. Kousei: Apparently, our follow count experienced a sudden surge these past few days. Kousei: All thanks to those pictures of you we posted, I'm sure. Mikado: Y-You don't say? Heh. I must say, I did not expect so many people to appreciate my sophistication. Suzune: Even so, our followers could be from anywhere around the globe. There's no guaranteeing they all live in the area. Suzune: If you get yourself too excited, you're just asking to be let down. Kousei: Not very optimistic, are you? Suzune: Ah, sorry. I didn't mean to be a wet blanket. Suzune: I just know how cruel reality can be from personal experience, so I guess I've gotten into the habit of thinking pragmatically. Sorry. Natsume: You don't have to apologize for that. You made a valid point. Natsume: Reality can certainly be unforgiving. But that's why we need to be focused on putting a smile on the face of everyone who walks through our door! Natsume: Once we can do that, people will be lining up outside our cafe in no time at all. Suzune: Yeah, that's exactly what I was trying to say! Kousei: Feels like you're just piggybacking on what she said, though. Suzune: Look, I'm just trying to pep everyone up! Mikado: In any case, both Sumizome-kun and Hiuchidani-kun have classes all morning, so we will be somewhat short-staffed for the time being. Best to keep that in mind. Kousei: Right. The last thing we want to do is inconvenience our customers. Mikado: It is approaching ten now, is it not? Kanna: I'll go flip the door sign to \"Open.\" Natsume: Ah--let me do that. I want to be the one to open the cafe today. Kanna: Of course. By all means. Natsume: *sigh*... We're really open. The day's finally here. Natsume: No, now's not the time to be getting sentimental. This is where the real challenge begins. Let's do this. ???: Finally open, are you? Natsume: Yes! Please, come in! Natsume: We have a customer! Kanna & Suzune & Kousei: Welcome to Cafe Stella! Kazufumi: Oh, it definitely has gotten brighter in here. Both the place and the people. Kazufumi: Hey, guys! I'm here for the big day. Kousei: Welcome. Please, have a seat. Kazufumi: Thanks. Suzune: Alright then. Back to the kitchen for us. Kousei: Right behind you. "
