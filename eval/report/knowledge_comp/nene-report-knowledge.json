Throughout the passage, there are hints of introspection, self-awareness, and a touch of absurdity.\n\nSome possible themes or points discussed in this passage include:\n\n*   **The Importance of Family**: The text touches upon the significance of family ties, the bond between loved ones, and how these connections can shape one's identity.\n*   **Self-Discovery**: The author grapples with questions about their own life, values, and desires, illustrating the process of self-discovery and growth.\n*   **Relationships and Connections**: Throughout the passage, there are mentions of friendships, romantic relationships, and even brief encounters with strangers. This highlights the intricate web of human connections that influence our lives.\n\nKeep in mind that this summary is an interpretation and may not fully capture the essence or intended meaning of your original passage.

It feels like we have, but I can't seem to remember a thing... Nene: E-Err... umm... Nene: W-Would you believe me if I said... I knew you in a previous life?  Shuuji: Huh... Shuuji: I guess I'd just be like, \"Yep, she's not in the Occult Club for nothing.\" Nene: ...Sorry, just forget I said that. I was just attempting a joke, but I see you didn't find it very funny.  Nene: The two of us met here at Himematsu Academy for the first time. Nene: Ah, that's something very important of― Shuuji: Huh... What's up with this? It's shining?? Nene: ...Huh? Wh-What is it... H-Huh?! Nene: I don't know... It's the first time I've seen it shine like that... Shuuji: Wait, really? Then why is it―Whoa?! Nene: Ahh! Nene: \"I just don't know how to describe these feelings... I've never had them before, ever.\" Nene: \"I... I love you. I'm madly in love with you, like you are with me. So much so that I spend every hour of the day thinking about nothing but you!\" Nene: \"Well... ugh... urgghhhh... That would be embarrassing... But I don't want to move from this place right now. That's more important.\" Nene: \"It may take a bit of time... But I swear to you that I'll find you and make you happy. We'll both smile again, together, from the bottom of our hearts.\" Nanao: ...... Nanao: My answer is no. There's no way I'm assisting you with such a pointless gamble.  Shuuji: Souma-san... Nanao: If you want to gamble, at least go with something that's possible, even if the odds are against you. I'd be willing to assist you with something like that. Shuuji: ...Huh? What are you... trying to say? Is there a way? Nanao: Yes, but I wouldn't recommend it. Seeing how desperate you are... Chances are high that a hole will reopen in your heart once Nene is gone.  Nanao: And if that happens... You might not be able to fix it this time around.  Shuuji: A hole in my heart from Nene's disappearance... Would that be something worse than the first one I had? Nanao: ...... Shuuji: So that means there's a point in taking the fragments from me.  Nanao: There is, however, a possibility that your heart could tear in two from it. Neither is really better than the other; they each are exceedingly dangerous.  Nanao: But I'm guessing if the risk is the same regardless... You'd rather choose the option with a glimmer of hope, yes?  Shuuji: Of course! Is there an option like that?!  Nanao: Think back to the event that ultimately led to you helping Nene with her witch activities. Shuuji: ......? Nanao: You see what I meant? That's exactly it. Nene won't ever have any heart fragments with her when she goes to the past. In which case, we just have to give her some to take with her.  Shuuji: So, essentially, the idea is to have the me in the world Nene goes to absorb the fragments of the me from this world?  Nanao: If that happens, you may be able to reunite. But, to be frank, that in and of itself is a gamble. Nanao: If your heart tears, Nene might come to regret her actions for the rest of her life. It could lead to her wishing she'd never met you.  Nanao: Plus, there's no telling if the other you will take the fragments. Just like how the dynamics of Nene's family will change, you yourself might have come to accept your ability by that point in time.  Nanao: If that happens, you might not even have a hole in your heart. You'd just reject the fragments altogether.  Nanao: There are an infinite number of hypotheticals involved. The odds really are that poor. So do you still want to― Shuuji: I'll still go through with it. Please give me your assistance, if possible. Nanao: ...... Nanao: Fine.  Shuuji: \"I wouldn't be able to help her and comfort her if that happened.\" Shuuji: \"I want her to find happiness. She's suffered long enough. She deserves enough happiness to make up for those years of pain and solitude.\" Shuuji: \"And if at all possible, I want to be the one that brings her that happiness.\" Shuuji: ―Aah! Hah...! *pant*... *pant*... Nene: Are you alright, Shuu―Hoshina-kun? Shuuji: Yeah, I'm good... Well, on second thought, maybe not... ugh... My head freaking hurts... Nene: Okay, but if you feel in pai―Wait, what? Shuuji: I really do owe you an apology. I've hurt you, Nene, and it went on for far too long. Nene: Did you just... call me Nene...? Shuuji: Ah, and I guess I oughta apologize for this too. Turned it to complete rubbish now.  Nene: ...Huh? Shuuji: I used the fragments inside of it to seal the hole in my heart. They became a part of me.  Nene: Huh? Ah, then... Huh...? What?? Hoshina... kun? Shuuji: You can call me \"Shuuji-kun\" if you'd rather do that... I'd kind of like you to, honestly. Nene: Does that mean you're... Shuuji: It's all come back to me. Well, that might not be the right way to put it. It's all kind of jumbled together... I feel like me, but not me at the same time... It might take a bit of time to get used to, but I think I can do it.  Shuuji: I'm not the exact same as the other me, but I know everything he did. I have all the memories of us together within me. Shuuji: I remember all the fun we had together... But I also realize the pain I put you through all these years... I'm so sorry, Nene. Nene: ...Ah... ah... Shuuji: But there's still one thing... I have left to find out. So would you mind telling me, Nene? Shuuji: Were you able to find the happiness you wanted?  Nene: That... goes without saying. You know the answer to that full-well.  Nene: I never had happiness, not even for a moment! Nene: I was all alone for so, so long! I was afraid I'd lost you because I messed with the future too much... That's why I held it all in, did everything I could, but for what gain...? Nene: Everyone around me found the happiness they were searching for, but I had nothing... Nene: And when I finally found you, you didn't notice me, completely ignored me, and when I finally got to talk to you, you looked at me like some deviant! Shuuji: You're the one who said something so ridiculous, Nene! Nene: What else was I supposed to do! Shuuji: Come on now, don't cry.  "

Shuuji: I wouldn't really say that.  Nene: Then... why? Do you maybe... not want to marry me anymore?  Shuuji: No, of course I do. I love you, Nene.

Shuuji: Thank you, Nene. Shuuji: ...You promise me you told your mom? Nene: Yes, you don't need to worry about that. She's already approved of you. She said if I loved you, then that was enough for her.  Shuuji: That's good.  Nene: But she won't help me persuade my dad any. I didn't expect her to be this much of a meanie...

Nene: First off, we have dinner. I'm hoping to make something extra special and more love-filled than usual, and I've already done some pre-cooking at home. Shuuji: Oh! I'm excited.  Nene: Is your dad going to be here today?  Shuuji: Nah, he's on a business trip. He won't be back till tomorrow night. Nene: Oh... That's a bit disappointing. I was hoping he could eat with us. Shuuji: Well, we can do that some other time. After all, we'll be together for life. Nene: Good point. So I guess I'll just be cooking for two today. Shuuji: Do we need to go out and buy anything? Nene: No, I already brought all the ingredients I need. So, would it be alright if I go ahead and start cooking now? Shuuji: Sure, I'll help. Let's make dinner together. That way we can spend more time together.  Nene: Yes, that's true. Shuuji: The bath is ready. You can go in first. Nene: Okay, thank you. "

They're both members of the School Occult Club, where I'm the president. One's name is Yusa Kouhei, and he's actually a pretty cool guy. He's been trying to help me deal with... my condition, but it's not like we've really talked about it or anything.\n\nThe other one is... well, it's a bit complicated. Her name is Sakura Akatsuki, and she's also a witch. She knows more about the magical world than I do, so sometimes she tries to give me advice on how to deal with my situation. But to be honest, we don't really get along that well either. It's just... there are things that don't add up between us, you know? Still, we're connected through the School Occult Club, so I suppose that counts for something.\n\nAs for friends outside of school... it's not like I have any. Well, not close ones anyway.

He's a bit of a loner like me, but we bonded over our love for the occult. We often meet up during lunch breaks to discuss various topics or help each other with our research. He's really smart and has some great ideas.\n\nThen there's Tanaka-san... (laugh) She's my best friend in the club. We have a lot of fun together, whether it's exploring the school's hidden passages or trying out new magical techniques. She's always so cheerful and supportive, even when things get tough.\n\nOf course, I also keep in touch with some online friends through various forums and social media groups.

Shuuji: Ah, sorry.  Nene: I'm sorry... I only participated as a pinch hitter. Schoolgirl D: But you can sing SO good, girl! With you, we could seriously become an international sensation!! Nene: I appreciate your kind words, I do... but I'm really sorry. I have no intention of singing any further. Schoolgirl D: Man, that's a bummer... I was ready to be a star.  Schoolgirl D: But if you ever change your mind, I'm always up for it! I'll wait for you, no matter how long it takes! Nene: U-Uhm, yes... Thank you.  Touko: Here, have some tea. I imagine you must be pretty exhausted.  Nene: Thank you, Togakushi-senpai. Touko: The only thing at home I can do is study, and doing that all day just turns my brain to mush. I'm sure you know that feeling.  Touko: So, if you guys don't mind, would it be alright if I stayed and helped the OC out?  Tsumugi: Only if you count the clubroom. If you count all the people that asked her in the classroom during school, it's way more than three.  Nene: It has been quite the day... Shuuji: ...Definitely. I can tell that just by looking at you. Touko: Well, it'll all die down soon. We just have to wait for word to spread that Ayachi-san won't keep singing.  Meguru: But still, she might get random requests to come fill for people if they lose a vocalist or something. Can't count out that possibility.  Nene: ...I really wouldn't like that. I never even expected to receive this much attention in the first place... It almost makes me wish I hadn't done this.  Touko: And I gotta imagine you'll get another rush of invitations once the cultural festival comes around next year.  Nene: Don't say that, Togakushi-senpai. Now I have to worry about that actually happening.  Touko: Oh, I'm sorry. But still, being prepared for it ahead of time isn't such a bad idea.  Nene: D-Don't worry, I have an excuse. I'll just tell them that the Occult Club is going to be doing a performance.  Shuuji: Let's hope that's enough to dissuade them.  Tsumugi: No need to worry about it now, you have time. A lot of things can change in a year, so you might as well just worry about it when the time comes.  Shuuji: True. We can't really make predictions about events that far off in the future.  Nene: Still... Just thinking about the possibility is enough to make me depressed... *sigh* Touko: How long do you guys usually stay?  Nene: It can vary depending on things, but generally, I would say we leave around six.  Shuuji: Do you wanna just call it a day now? We can do that. I know several of the sports teams end around this time too.  Touko: Good idea. I imagine Ayachi-san wants to go on home and lay down.  Meguru: We don't have to stay if you don't want to, Nene-senpai. Tsumugi: And don't forget, this is a weekday. Don't you want to be well-rested for school tomorrow? Nene: Okay... If you all have no reservations, then I suppose we can end things here for today.  Meguru: Alright, then see you guys tomorrow!  Nene: See you tomorrow. Shuuji: Alright... I got the milk, and I got the kinpira burdock. Clerk: Alright, here you are! That'll be 605 Yen. Shuuji: Here.  Clerk: 605 exactly. Thank you, thank you. Please come see us again. Shuuji: Phew, NOW I'm done. Time to go on home and get some din?Hm? Nene: ...... Nene: Huh? Ah, hello, Hoshina-kun! What are you doing here? Shuuji: Nothing much. Just doing some shopping before dinner. What're you up to?  Shuuji: I noticed you pacing around for some time.  Nene: Y-You just stood there and watched? Why didn't you come up and say something sooner... Shuuji: Sorry, I was just a little confused, so I wound up staring. Are you out grocery shopping too? Nene: No, not quite. Today was pretty exhausting for me, so I was thinking of maybe going somewhere... Shuuji: Ah, yeah, I feel that. Sometimes you just don't wanna bother with whipping up something yourself.  Shuuji: ...Ramen? Nene: I told you not to look... Shuuji: S-Sorry. But really, I don't see anything to be embarrassed about.  Nene: You really don't think it's... strange or anything? You can't tell me a girl eating at a ramen restaurant all by herself doesn't weird you out.  Shuuji: Oh no, not at all. I don't see anything wrong with it. Nene: O-Oh, well thank you. Nene: It's not something I love, per se... but I've been curious to explore it.  Nene: Do you remember that day when you and I went with Inaba-san to the conveyor-belt sushi restaurant? Shuuji: Yeah, I do.  Nene: Well, it's much the same scenario... I've never actually been to a ramen restaurant before.  Shuuji: Is that so? Shuuji: You're getting cold feet?  Nene: That's right... I looked in and only saw men dining there, so I got scared.  Nene: But the thing is, I'm not sure I'll ever work up the courage to do this again if I walk away... Shuuji: Is trying this ramen that important to you?  Nene: ...Yes. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Umm... would you like me to come with you? Maybe that would help. Nene: Ah, er, wait... I thought you were going to be eating dinner at home.  Shuuji: Nah, it's all good. None of it'll get cold. Shuuji: And all this talk of ramen's gotten me a little curious... You wouldn't mind if I joined you, would you?  Shuuji: Absolutely. Ready to go on in? Nene: Yes! Shuuji: Coming.  Nene: Ramen! Oh, Ramen! Nene: It'll be my first time having real ramen instead of the cheap, instant kind. I can't wait to see how it tastes. Nene: Is that some sort of problem, perhaps?  Shuuji: Well, before we go in, let me check with you: are you aware of what kind of place this is?  Nene: Come again? I thought it was a ramen place. Is it not? Really? But I'm sure I― Shuuji: Weeell, you could SAY it's a ramen place, but that's not quite the full picture... Let's just say it's a bit of special place. Nene: Oh, you don't have to worry about that. I've done my research prior to coming here.  Shuuji: Really?  Nene: Yes. I have it all down pat. Shuuji: Yeah, a few times with Kaidou.  Shuuji: Ah, yes. Just us two.  Clerk: We got two free seats together, so come on and follow me.  Shuuji: Are you ready, Ayachi-san? Nene: Yes! Clerk: How's it goin', y'all! Shuuji: What are you getting? Nene: The extra large char siu. Shuuji: The extra large?  Nene: Am I not allowed to?  Shuuji: Well, you are, but it's gonna be a lot of food. You sure you can handle it?  Nene: Absolutely. It might seem surprising, but I'm actually a large eater.  Shuuji: Oh, really?  Shuuji: ...Are you sure about that? Nene: Huh? Clerk: Er, yeah, absolutely, miss... W-We'll have that out to ya.  Shuuji: A-Ayachi-san, what are you DOING?! Nene: What? Is something the matter?  Shuuji: A-Are you sure you want that? Like, are you REALLY sure you want that?  Nene: Well... is that not the special code that you chant when ordering it? I read on the internet that first-timers should simply stick to ordering it that way. Shuuji: Man oh man... You actually believed that... Nene: Now it's only a matter of time before it comes out and I get to eat it! Oh, I wonder what it'll taste like... I'm so excited♪ Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Yeah, we've already ordered and everything.  Nene: I feel a little bad. My apologies. But still, I'm glad our path's crossed.  Shuuji: Y-You are...? Nene: Absolutely. I've been eager to eat at this place for so, so long. Nene: Plus enjoying meals with others is something I seldom get the chance to do. It's always nice to have company.  Shuuji: O-Ohh... yeah. Shuuji: Yeah, I'm all good.  Shuuji: That exciting for you?  Nene: Oh, yes! I've had my eyes on this restaurant for so, sooo long. But I could never bring myself to come, you see. Nene: Just to put my frustration into perspective for you, if I had waited a tad bit longer, it might've been possible to retrieve fragments from me. Shuuji: Eh, I don't know, that sounds like a bit of an exaggeration.  Nene: I guarantee you it's not. I'm genuinely happy.   Nene: But, just so you know... If you don't want to stay here with me, you don't have to. You're free to leave anytime.  Shuuji: I don't mind. And if anything, I enjoy hanging out with you.  Nene: Huh...?! Umm, what did you― Shuuji: A-Ah, uhm! I just meant that, like, when I'm with you I don't have to worry about my secret, so it makes me feel relaxed, I guess? Or comfortable? Something like that.  Nene: Ah, yes, of course. Don't worry, I fully understand what you're trying to say.  Nene: And also, I enjoy hanging out with you too, Hoshina-kun.  Shuuji: ―――! Nene: ...... Nene: A-Also, I think I ought to thank you. You've really helped me out in a variety of ways.  Shuuji: Oh, no, I'm not looking for thanks. Really, I should be the one apologizing, considering you still haven't gotten back all your fragments.  Nene: No, that's perfectly alright. They are coming back, slowly but surely.  Nene: Ah! It's finally here♪ I finally get to taste real ramen♪ Shuuji: ...... Nene: Umm... What is this?  Shuuji: An extra large char siu ramen with noodles firm and spicy, extra veggies, and extra extra garlic oil. Nene: But, the thing is, I don't see the noodles. Where are they? Shuuji: Beneath that mountain of vegetables somewhere. Nene: ...This isn't ramen like I know it.  Shuuji: Well, this isn't regular ramen. It's the \"Taroumaru\" style of ramen.  Nene: Ramen... Nene: Ah, goodness! I can't mope around like this; That would be a definite breach of the sacred ramen etiquette! I have to start eating.  Shuuji: What?! Sacred ramen etiquette?! Nene: No. I was the one who ordered it, so I'll eat all of it. Well then, without further ado.  Shuuji: Well, at first, yeah. Oh, and you ate the vegetables. That's not part of the ramen.  Shuuji: True.  Shuuji: %130;HOW IN―?! Guest A: Yer frickin' kidding... That lass ate everything, even the soup... Guest B: And she's as slim as a twig?! Guest C: But boy is she a looker... Help, boys, I'm fallin' in love! Nene: D-Do you need something? You're staring at me, and it's making me rather embarrassed.  Nene: Is there something on my face, perhaps?  Shuuji: No, not that. I was just wondering, like... how does that slim body of yours even hold all that food... Guest A: Who IS that girl, seriously?! Guest B: Man, I don't even think I'd be able to eat all that.  Guest C: ...I wanna have an eating contest with her! Nene: ......? The other customers seem to be talking amongst themselves about something. Do you know why?  Shuuji: Probably. They just witnessed the birth of a new legend.  Nene: Huh... A legend, you say...? Nene: That and then some. It was simply delicious. But, ugh... I think I may have overeaten just a little bit.  Shuuji: Just a LITTLE...? Nene: My stomach's so full I might not be able to fit anything else in the rest of the day. It was very worthwhile coming here. Nene: And, of course, I have to thank you for accompanying me.  Shuuji: My pleasure.  Nene: Thanks to you, this won't be nagging at my chest anymore... I feel relieved. Guest B: And she ate so gracefully too... Damn, I'm a jealous man.  Guest C: I wanna challenge her to an eat-off.  Nene: I don't know why... but I feel like we're drawing a lot of attention.  Shuuji: Ah... yeah... Nene: Come on. Shuuji: I-I'm coming... Shuuji: What do you mean?  Nene: Well, so many people were staring at me... So I had the idea that maybe I'd done something disrespectful or rude.  Shuuji: No, you didn't do anything wrong. They were looking at you out of admiration. Nene: But for what reason? All I did was eat a bowl of ramen.  Shuuji: That was no ordinary bowl of ramen, though.  Nene: ......? I'm still somewhat confused, but it's good to know that they at least weren't angry at me, or sneering at me.   Shuuji: Oh, I forgot to ask. How's your stomach? Does it hurt any?  Nene: No, it feels quite fine. The only thing my chest is full of right now is joy and content *siigh*... Nene: What's wrong, Hoshina-kun? Shuuji: Ah, nothing. Glad to hear you liked it; I enjoyed mine too. It was a pretty fun time, all things considered.  Nene: I feel the same. Really, though... It feels like I have fun whatever I'm doing when you're there too.  Shuuji: Wh-Where'd that come from... Could you explain that a little more?  Nene: Well, we have many more members in the club now, and I got to go to the ramen place I've been longing to try. It's just been new experiences day after day... I enjoy my life a lot more.  Shuuji: R-Really? Nene: Yes. That's the honest truth.  Shuuji: Come to think of it, it's the same for me. I've made so many new experiences since joining the club. Hanging out with girls outside of school, participating in a school event, and so on and so forth.  Shuuji: My life would've been a million times duller if I hadn't made the decision to be more social and outgoing.  Nene: Huh? Oh, hardly. I haven't done anything quite that special.  Shuuji: Oh, but you have. Also, not as a repayment or anything, but if you ever feel scared to go someplace alone again... Just ask me, and I'll gladly come with you.  Nene: ...Er, umm... but... Nene: ...... Nene: Can I... hold you to that, then? Shuuji: Of course. Just hit me up whenever.  Nene: Thank you! Haha.  Shuuji: Of course, that's only if you don't mind me tagging along.  Nene: Why would I mind? Remember what I just told you? Every moment is fun when I'm with you.  Shuuji: O-Oh, uh, thanks. Shuuji: I'm in the same boat as you. Ever since I joined the OC, and became friends with you, I've been having so much fun. Nene: ―――! Nene: Th-Thank... you... Nene: Y-Yes. We ended club early today so I could go home and get rested up. It would be disrespectful to the rest of the club members if I stayed out late wandering around town.  Shuuji: Huh? Nene: Look, over there. That has to be her.  Shuuji: Oh, you're right. Shuuji: Yeah, better not disturb them if they're on a date.  Nene: Let's hurry and be on our way before she sees us.  Shuuji: That's the smartest idea, yeah.  Shuuji: Good to hear.  Nene: Make sure you get a good night's rest too, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Sure thing. Well, Ayachi-san, see you at school tomorrow. Goodnight.  Nene: Goodnight.  Nene: ...... Nene: Ack!! Wh-What did I just SAY?! "

But when I do get some time off, I love to cook! I'm actually quite passionate about trying out new recipes and experimenting with different flavors. There's something about mixing ingredients together that just makes me happy.\n\nI also enjoy reading in my free time. I'm a bit of a bookworm, so I devour all sorts of novels and manga. (smiles softly) It's like I can escape into another world through the pages... which is kind of ironic, considering I'm already dealing with some pretty intense supernatural stuff.\n\nOf course, who wouldn't love shopping? (giggles again) As a popular girl at school, I get to indulge in all sorts of fashionable fun. And when I'm not stuck in class or club meetings, you can find me cosplaying and singing - music is just so therapeutic for me!\n\nBut let's just keep the time travel thing on the down low, okay?

My friends always tease me about how fast I finish my reading assignments, but hey, someone's got to keep up with the latest developments in magical theory, right?\n\nI also enjoy cooking! There's something so soothing about chopping vegetables and simmering sauces that just melts all my worries away. My signature dish is a mean tonkatsu – I'm convinced it's because of the magic I put into it (just kidding... or am I?).\n\nShopping is another one of my favorite hobbies. I love browsing through all the latest fashions at Harajuku, and I always keep an eye out for new cosplay inspiration. Who knows when my next costume party will be?\n\nAnd of course, as a witch with supernatural abilities (shh, don't tell anyone), I enjoy practicing my magical skills whenever I have some free time. It's all about balance in life, right? Time travel is especially fun – where else can you go that doesn't involve getting into trouble with the teachers at school?\n\nUmm... I think that's it for now! What about you? Do you have any favorite hobbies or activities? *curious smile*",

Shuuji: Well, we still have 10 minutes before it's time. She shouldn't be too long... Kawakami: Honestly, I expected you to be dead last, Inaba. Meguru: Mgh. Judging people on appearances is a little rude, you know.  Shuuji: Nah, you're not late or anything. Don't worry about it.  Nene: Sorry... It took me a bit of time to get myself ready... Shuuji: Oh, I see. But hey, the outfit looks great on you. Super cute, Nene. Nene: Th-Thank you... Hehehe. Kawakami: ...Is the difference really that noticeable? I mean, sure, she looks cute like she always does, but I dunno... Meguru: What are you saying? The difference is HUGE. Her hair ends are trimmed, and her cuticles also look perfect. I'd totally bet she's been to a beauty salon.  Kawakami: You serious...? I can't see squat. Heck, like, is it even possible to tell differences in something like trimmed hair ends? Meguru: Actually, popular guys notice these things.  Kawakami: Oh... No wonder Hoshina-senpai did. It's crazy that he's so attentive to detail. Meguru: Hmm... I don't know about that. In his case, I feel like it isn't visual awareness that led to it, but a little thing called \"situational\" awareness.  Shuuji: ...... Meguru: But you better keep in mind, complimenting for the sake of complimenting is a no-no. Kawakami: Ah, okay. Interesting.  Shuuji: ...... Nene: Yes. Kawakami: So where're you gonna be going? Shuuji: Hmm... I like the arcade. Meguru: An arcade for the first place? Very interesting choice. Kawakami: Umm, according to what I've read, arcades aren't a good spot to go on a date... Shuuji: That's just in general. With everything, it really just depends on you and your partner, and your tastes and interests.  Nene: I quite like arcades myself. I've never actually been to one proper, though, so I'm fairly excited for this.  Meguru: Whoa, really?  Nene: I have entered one before, but we were short on time then, so all we did was go to the photo booth. Kawakami: Ohh, okay... Kawakami: So it's the same with dates as it is with shaggin'! Can't go by the books! Shuuji: Yes, but PLEASE don't say that out loud, for Christ's sake!! Meguru: Shaggin? What does that mean? Kawakami: Nah, it's nothing! Just forget I said that, Inaba. Meguru: Hmm. Something smells veeery fishy.  Shuuji: Come on, we're going.  Kawakami: Ah, we're gonna tail you guys from a short distance.  Nene: Oh, you are? I was under the impression we would all stay together... Meguru: Oh no, that'd make things way too awkward for you two.  Kawakami: I wanna know how couples act naturally, is all. If we constantly interrupted y'all with comments and whatnot, that'd pretty much defeat the purpose. Kawakami: Just forget about us two and do your thing. Go on, go on. Shuuji: It's kind of hard to do that when we know we're being watched... Shuuji: No point in dawdling around here forever. Let's go, Nene. Nene: Yes, I'm ready.  Shuuji: If you want, sure. Do you like them? Nene: I do like them, yes... But more so, I thought it would be nice to have some sort of physical object to remember our dates by.  Nene: Do you remember how you suggested we get a cork board before?  Shuuji: So that's what you want... Shuuji: Alright, then! In that case, I'm gonna get you a plushie as a present today. Nene: A plushie? Shuuji: Yep. One from those claw machines. And we can even include it in the picture we take! Nene: Oh, that's a fantastic idea. I'd love that. If you can get one, that'd be wonderful. Shuuji: Almost there, almost there... And, now! Nene: Please don't drop it, please don't drop it... Shuuji: I guess there has to be a way... "

Have you figured something out? Nene: Now, she's not too confident about this, since she doesn't know if it will work or not... but Nanao wants to try something. Shuuji: What is it?! Nene: It's related to how Shiiba-san and I collect fragments. You know how we use our magic to convert people's emotions into fragments we can collect, right? Tsumugi: The gist of it is that we can use our magic weapons to interfere with a person's heart by injecting it with magic. Shuuji: So, you have a spell that can help her wake up? Nene: Not quite. Due to the way the seal is actively maintained, it is probably too difficult to cancel it as a third party. Tsumugi: We're not going to use a spell. We'll hit her with a direct concentration of magic. Nene: That should be strong enough to interfere with the magic seal, cause it to malfunction, and then break down completely. Shuuji: Break down...? Will Touko-san be okay? Nene: Souma-san said she probably will be. Nene: Getting hit by concentrated magic can be rather traumatic, but it should have no long-lasting or severe effects on Senpai. Shuuji: I see... Shuuji: But how are you gonna get that concentrated magic? Tsumugi: We've decided to take it from what we've gathered so far. Shuuji: Huh?! You can't do that! Nene: It's fine. We owe a lot to you two. Tsumugi: Yeah. Besides, this current situation makes me sad too. Tsumugi: The OC just isn't the same without everyone there. Nene: That's right. At this rate, we'll be too worried to help anyone who comes for a consultation. Tsumugi: So there you have it. Nene: You're not the only one worried about Togakushi-senpai, you know? Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Yeah... Thank you. Nene: Please don't mention it. Tsumugi: Yeah! And, um... I hate to say it, but... we still don't know if this will work or not. Shuuji: Even so, I'm so grateful to you guys. Nene: What did I just say? You're not the only one worried. We don't need your thanks. Tsumugi: Yeah, totally. We'll talk more about this after school. Shuuji: Yeah, thanks. Shuuji: That's fine by me, but... Meguru: ...? But what? Meguru: You're not going to tell me that I'm not allowed to go, are you? I'm worried too. The least you could let me do is say hello. Shuuji: No, I wasn't going to say that. Shuuji: Got it. I really appreciate her coming with us. Tsumugi: Okay. Let's go before it gets too late. Meguru: Here we are! Tsumugi: Togakushi-senpai... Oh, she's sleeping. Meguru: Then let's try not to make too much noise. Meguru: We should do something with these flowers first. Is there a vase here? Tsumugi: Dunno. She's just a student living on her own, so maybe not. Meguru: Oh, we mighta screwed up... What should we do? Shuuji: There are some empty bottles over there that might do the job. Meguru: Oh, okay. I'll wash one out and use it. Meguru: What about the sponge? We should probably use a different one from the dish sponge. I don't want to get that one dirty. Shuuji: We have new ones. I'll just buy more if we run out. Meguru: You sound like you're used to this. Shuuji: Well, you know... Meguru: Yeah, leave it to me. Shuuji: Great, thanks. Nene: How does her situation look, Nanao? Nanao: I don't see any change. There's no telling when she'll recover if we leave her on her own... Nanao: I think we should give it a go. By interfering, we may at least create an opportunity for something to change. Shuuji: ...Very well. Nene: Okay then. Let's try it. Tsumugi: We have to do something about Meguru-chan first. Shuuji: Yeah. Meguru: This should be good. Yeah, nice and clean. They don't really smell, but I better put them on this table so they're outta the way. Meguru: Looking good. That just leaves the shawl we bought. It's starting to get cold out, so it should come in handy. Meguru: I'll give it to you before I forget, Hoshina-senpai. Please give it to Togakushi-senpai when she wakes up. Shuuji: Alright. I'll be sure to tell her these are get-well gifts from you all. Shuuji: Sorry to ask you this, but could you do some shopping for us? We need milk and some kind of fruit. Meguru: Huh? Why didn't you buy that on the way here? Shuuji: I totally forgot, sorry. Would you mind doing this me, please? Meguru: *sigh* Ya big moron. Fine. Where's the local supermarket? Shuuji: You'll find one after heading west from here for about five minutes. Meguru: Roger that. So, which way's west? Shuuji: Leave the building, and go in the direction of the hand you hold your chopsticks in. Meguru: Look, I know the difference between right and left! Nanao: That's plenty. If you two could activate your witch forms. Nene, Tsumugi: Certainly. Nene: So then, what exactly do we have to do? Tsumugi: You still haven't told us what it is we'll be doing. Nanao: Nothing out of the ordinary. Just do as you always do. Nanao: However, Nene, use this bullet. Nanao: Our preparations are complete. Now Shiiba-san should be able to pour her magic into this girl as well. Nene: And I just have to shoot this magic bullet at her? Nanao: Correct. I've enchanted your magic weapons to do the reverse of what they usually do during collection. What's most important are the emotions you two feel as you send your magic. Nene: Our emotions? Tsumugi: What do you mean? Nanao: I need you to put everything you feel for her into the magic you're hitting her with. Nanao: Those emotions will become a voice, which should help in calling out to her conscious self and waking her up. Nene: ...Understood. Tsumugi: But... Wouldn't it be more effective to use Hoshina-kun's emotions? Nanao: That would be preferable, but he can't use magic weapons. I'll try to think of a way for him to help, just in case... but I can't think of anything right now. Nanao: We're leaving this in your hands. Tsumugi: R-Right. Nene: Okay, let's do this at the exact same time. Tsumugi: Yeah. Tsumugi: So please, wake up and come back to us. Let's all go back to the clubroom together. Nene: We've been waiting for you. So...

I'll just tell them that the Occult Club is going to be doing a performance.  Shuuji: Let's hope that's enough to dissuade them.  Tsumugi: No need to worry about it now, you have time. A lot of things can change in a year, so you might as well just worry about it when the time comes.  Shuuji: True. We can't really make predictions about events that far off in the future.  Nene: Still... Just thinking about the possibility is enough to make me depressed... *sigh* Touko: How long do you guys usually stay?  Nene: It can vary depending on things, but generally, I would say we leave around six.  Shuuji: Do you wanna just call it a day now? We can do that. I know several of the sports teams end around this time too.  Touko: Good idea. I imagine Ayachi-san wants to go on home and lay down.

Shuuji: Is trying this ramen that important to you?  Nene: ...Yes. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Umm... would you like me to come with you? Maybe that would help. Nene: Ah, er, wait... I thought you were going to be eating dinner at home.  Shuuji: Nah, it's all good. None of it'll get cold. Shuuji: And all this talk of ramen's gotten me a little curious... You wouldn't mind if I joined you, would you?  Shuuji: Absolutely. Ready to go on in? Nene: Yes! Shuuji: Coming.  Nene: Ramen! Oh, Ramen! Nene: It'll be my first time having real ramen instead of the cheap, instant kind. I can't wait to see how it tastes. Nene: Is that some sort of problem, perhaps?  Shuuji: Well, before we go in, let me check with you: are you aware of what kind of place this is?  Nene: Come again? I thought it was a ramen place. Is it not? Really? But I'm sure I― Shuuji: Weeell, you could SAY it's a ramen place, but that's not quite the full picture... Let's just say it's a bit of special place. Nene: Oh, you don't have to worry about that. I've done my research prior to coming here.  Shuuji: Really?  Nene: Yes. I have it all down pat. Shuuji: Yeah, a few times with Kaidou.  Shuuji: Ah, yes. Just us two.  Clerk: We got two free seats together, so come on and follow me.  Shuuji: Are you ready, Ayachi-san? Nene: Yes! Clerk: How's it goin', y'all! Shuuji: What are you getting? Nene: The extra large char siu. Shuuji: The extra large?  Nene: Am I not allowed to?  Shuuji: Well, you are, but it's gonna be a lot of food. You sure you can handle it?  Nene: Absolutely. It might seem surprising, but I'm actually a large eater.  Shuuji: Oh, really?  Shuuji: ...Are you sure about that? Nene: Huh? Clerk: Er, yeah, absolutely, miss... W-We'll have that out to ya.  Shuuji: A-Ayachi-san, what are you DOING?! Nene: What? Is something the matter?  Shuuji: A-Are you sure you want that? Like, are you REALLY sure you want that?  Nene: Well... is that not the special code that you chant when ordering it? I read on the internet that first-timers should simply stick to ordering it that way. Shuuji: Man oh man... You actually believed that... Nene: Now it's only a matter of time before it comes out and I get to eat it! Oh, I wonder what it'll taste like... I'm so excited♪ Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Yeah, we've already ordered and everything.  Nene: I feel a little bad. My apologies. But still, I'm glad our path's crossed.  Shuuji: Y-You are...? Nene: Absolutely. I've been eager to eat at this place for so, so long. Nene: Plus enjoying meals with others is something I seldom get the chance to do. It's always nice to have company.  Shuuji: O-Ohh... yeah. Shuuji: Yeah, I'm all good.  Shuuji: That exciting for you?  Nene: Oh, yes! I've had my eyes on this restaurant for so, sooo long. But I could never bring myself to come, you see. Nene: Just to put my frustration into perspective for you, if I had waited a tad bit longer, it might've been possible to retrieve fragments from me. Shuuji: Eh, I don't know, that sounds like a bit of an exaggeration.  Nene: I guarantee you it's not. I'm genuinely happy.   Nene: But, just so you know... If you don't want to stay here with me, you don't have to. You're free to leave anytime.  Shuuji: I don't mind. And if anything, I enjoy hanging out with you.  Nene: Huh...?! Umm, what did you― Shuuji: A-Ah, uhm! I just meant that, like, when I'm with you I don't have to worry about my secret, so it makes me feel relaxed, I guess? Or comfortable? Something like that.  Nene: Ah, yes, of course. Don't worry, I fully understand what you're trying to say.  Nene: And also, I enjoy hanging out with you too, Hoshina-kun.  Shuuji: ―――! Nene: ...... Nene: A-Also, I think I ought to thank you. You've really helped me out in a variety of ways.  Shuuji: Oh, no, I'm not looking for thanks. Really, I should be the one apologizing, considering you still haven't gotten back all your fragments.  Nene: No, that's perfectly alright. They are coming back, slowly but surely.  Nene: Ah! It's finally here♪ I finally get to taste real ramen♪ Shuuji: ...... Nene: Umm... What is this?  Shuuji: An extra large char siu ramen with noodles firm and spicy, extra veggies, and extra extra garlic oil. Nene: But, the thing is, I don't see the noodles. Where are they? Shuuji: Beneath that mountain of vegetables somewhere. Nene: ...This isn't ramen like I know it.  Shuuji: Well, this isn't regular ramen. It's the \"Taroumaru\" style of ramen.  Nene: Ramen... Nene: Ah, goodness! I can't mope around like this; That would be a definite breach of the sacred ramen etiquette! I have to start eating.  Shuuji: What?! Sacred ramen etiquette?! Nene: No. I was the one who ordered it, so I'll eat all of it. Well then, without further ado.  Shuuji: Well, at first, yeah. Oh, and you ate the vegetables. That's not part of the ramen.  Shuuji: True.  Shuuji: %130;HOW IN―?! Guest A: Yer frickin' kidding... That lass ate everything, even the soup... Guest B: And she's as slim as a twig?! Guest C: But boy is she a looker... Help, boys, I'm fallin' in love! Nene: D-Do you need something? You're staring at me, and it's making me rather embarrassed.  Nene: Is there something on my face, perhaps?  Shuuji: No, not that. I was just wondering, like... how does that slim body of yours even hold all that food... Guest A: Who IS that girl, seriously?! Guest B: Man, I don't even think I'd be able to eat all that.  Guest C: ...I wanna have an eating contest with her! Nene: ......? The other customers seem to be talking amongst themselves about something. Do you know why?  Shuuji: Probably. They just witnessed the birth of a new legend.  Nene: Huh... A legend, you say...? Nene: That and then some. It was simply delicious. But, ugh... I think I may have overeaten just a little bit.  Shuuji: Just a LITTLE...? Nene: My stomach's so full I might not be able to fit anything else in the rest of the day. It was very worthwhile coming here. Nene: And, of course, I have to thank you for accompanying me.  Shuuji: My pleasure.  Nene: Thanks to you, this won't be nagging at my chest anymore... I feel relieved. Guest B: And she ate so gracefully too... Damn, I'm a jealous man.  Guest C: I wanna challenge her to an eat-off.  Nene: I don't know why... but I feel like we're drawing a lot of attention.  Shuuji: Ah... yeah... Nene: Come on. Shuuji: I-I'm coming... Shuuji: What do you mean?  Nene: Well, so many people were staring at me... So I had the idea that maybe I'd done something disrespectful or rude.  Shuuji: No, you didn't do anything wrong. They were looking at you out of admiration. Nene: But for what reason? All I did was eat a bowl of ramen.  Shuuji: That was no ordinary bowl of ramen, though.  Nene: ......? I'm still somewhat confused, but it's good to know that they at least weren't angry at me, or sneering at me.   Shuuji: Oh, I forgot to ask. How's your stomach? Does it hurt any?  Nene: No, it feels quite fine. The only thing my chest is full of right now is joy and content *siigh*... Nene: What's wrong, Hoshina-kun? Shuuji: Ah, nothing. Glad to hear you liked it; I enjoyed mine too. It was a pretty fun time, all things considered.  Nene: I feel the same. Really, though... It feels like I have fun whatever I'm doing when you're there too.  Shuuji: Wh-Where'd that come from... Could you explain that a little more?  Nene: Well, we have many more members in the club now, and I got to go to the ramen place I've been longing to try. It's just been new experiences day after day... I enjoy my life a lot more.  Shuuji: R-Really? Nene: Yes. That's the honest truth.  Shuuji: Come to think of it, it's the same for me. I've made so many new experiences since joining the club. Hanging out with girls outside of school, participating in a school event, and so on and so forth.  Shuuji: My life would've been a million times duller if I hadn't made the decision to be more social and outgoing.  Nene: Huh? Oh, hardly. I haven't done anything quite that special.  Shuuji: Oh, but you have. Also, not as a repayment or anything, but if you ever feel scared to go someplace alone again... Just ask me, and I'll gladly come with you.  Nene: ...Er, umm... but... Nene: ...... Nene: Can I... hold you to that, then? Shuuji: Of course. Just hit me up whenever.  Nene: Thank you! Haha.  Shuuji: Of course, that's only if you don't mind me tagging along.  Nene: Why would I mind? Remember what I just told you? Every moment is fun when I'm with you.  Shuuji: O-Oh, uh, thanks. Shuuji: I'm in the same boat as you. Ever since I joined the OC, and became friends with you, I've been having so much fun. Nene: ―――! Nene: Th-Thank... you... Nene: Y-Yes. We ended club early today so I could go home and get rested up. It would be disrespectful to the rest of the club members if I stayed out late wandering around town.  Shuuji: Huh? Nene: Look, over there. That has to be her.  Shuuji: Oh, you're right. Shuuji: Yeah, better not disturb them if they're on a date.  Nene: Let's hurry and be on our way before she sees us.  Shuuji: That's the smartest idea, yeah.  Shuuji: Good to hear.  Nene: Make sure you get a good night's rest too, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Sure thing. Well, Ayachi-san, see you at school tomorrow. Goodnight.  Nene: Goodnight.  Nene: ...... Nene: Ack!! Wh-What did I just SAY?! "

It's like my hormones just go haywire for no reason.\n\nTo be honest, it's super embarrassing and uncomfortable.

In private. *blushes* It's really not something I like to think about or talk about, but it's just part of the deal with being a witch, I guess.\n\nIt makes me feel really self-conscious and anxious all the time, because you never know when it might happen.

My friends think I'm just a popular and carefree person, but the truth is, it's a constant battle to keep my secret hidden. And it's not just the physical aspect that's hard...

It's about time for me to head home too. Shuuji: Sorry I dragged you along with me. And thanks. Wakana: You're welcome. Okay then, good luck. Shuuji: See ya. Nene: The sun is starting to set. What does Kawakami-kun's schedule say from here on? Shuuji: Nothing special. They'll eat dinner together somewhere, then he'll see her home. Meguru: And where does he plan on eating? Shuuji: He put down a somewhat fancy place. Let's see... Ah, this one. Look, it's this one in the pamphlet.  Nene: This restaurant, huh... Meguru: It looks pretty expensive. Shuuji: I don't think the prices will be that outrageous, but yeah, it doesn't seem cheap. I guess he wants to make their first date something special. Meguru: I get that, but this might be going too far... Nene: Maeda-san would get nervous and worry about the price if it's too expensive. Shuuji: Yeah, but he'll be covering the bill, won't he? Meguru: But then she'll feel like she's mooching off of him. I don't think Maeda-san would be happy with that. Shuuji: I see. Nene: Wouldn't somewhere you can relax be better? A place more fitting for students. Meguru: I know how Kawakami-kun feels, but yeah... I think she'd accept an average-tasting dinner if it means she can have a good time with him, yeah? Shuuji: Hmm... You have a point. What about ramen, then? Meguru: No. Ramen is a clear no-go. Nene: As a girl, I'm sure she'll dress up for her first date, so she would be worried about the broth spatters. Food with a strong smell is also bad for the same reason. Shuuji: Then what about... a Raizeriya? The food is good, it's cheap, and it's got a pretty casual atmosphere. Meguru: Sure, the food is good there and it's fitting for students. But going to a cheap chain restaurant on the first date...? Well, I'm sure Maeda-san would be okay with that. Nene: It might be Kawakami-kun who has a problem with that, since he planned out this date so meticulously. Shuuji: True... He's a guy, after all. He has his pride. Meguru: I guess Kawakami-kun can keep his choice as a last resort, but he should play it safe and ask her where she'd like to go first. Meguru: After all, what you feel like eating depends on your mood. Nene: I agree. Shuuji: But then he'd get the old \"Anything goes,\" swiftly followed up by \"Really? THAT place?\" once you suggest something. Meguru: That's a pretty jaded outlook on women. I don't think Maeda-san would embarrass her date like that. Nene: And wouldn't a conversation about food preferences help liven things up? Meguru: You know it, Nene-senpai! Getting to know each other more like that is a nice thing. Nene: I believe the best way would be to discuss where to go together, with Kawakami-kun's choice being presented as an option. Shuuji: While we're at it, what are your thoughts on the whole date plan itself? Meguru: Hmm... It's okay, but it does feel like he's going for a little too much. Meguru: Things like going to the movies and window shopping are good and all, but it might be a little tiring with the lack of breaks. Nene: If he wants to go see that movie, it might be a good idea to relax in a cafe afterwards. Shuuji: I see. Nene: Apart from that, how about making sure he watches Maeda-san carefully? Shuuji: What do you mean? Nene: There's a lot to watch out for, such as not walking too fast. Her feet might start hurting depending on what shoes she wears. Meguru: On that note, you're walking too fast, Senpai. That's not good. Shuuji: Whoops... I wasn't thinking about that at all. Meguru: That kind of casual kindness makes girls pretty happy. Shuuji: I'll watch out for that from now on. Shuuji: Okay. I'll put all of our advice together in a text... Something like this, I guess? Meguru: Are you done? Shuuji: Yep. I also made sure to double-check it. Nothing important was left out. Nene: Well then, what shall we do now? Go home? Meguru: Huh?! Go home?! I thought we were having dinner together, so I told my parents not to make me anything! Nene: Then I don't mind going somewhere to eat. Are you coming along, Hoshina-kun? Shuuji: I don't see why not. It would beat making something for myself at home. Meguru: Do you make your own dinners? Shuuji: Yeah. All the household tasks are my job. My mother passed away a while ago, so it's just me and my dad. Meguru: Oh. Umm... Shuuji: Don't worry, I don't mind talking about it. I actually really hate it when people get awkward about it. Meguru: O-Okay. Roger that. Shuuji: Eating out is alright on your end, Ayachi-san? Nene: Yes. I live by myself, so there won't be a problem. Meguru: You live by yourself? That's pretty cool! Nene: Really? I personally don't think it's anything that great. Shuuji: Yeah, I imagine the downsides outweigh the upsides. Shuuji: Sure, but what should we eat? Nene: I'm fine with anything. There's nothing I dislike. Shuuji: What are you in the mood for, though? Anything you've been craving? Meguru: Oh, I know! Give me a \"shi\"! Give me a \"su\"! It's \"shisu\"! Shuuji: How old are you, again? Are you my grandmother? Who says it like that these days? Meguru: Hey, I'm a lovely young maiden! My stuffed animals tell me so every night! Shuuji: ...You still talk to your stuffed animals? Meguru: Huh? Oh... I kinda talk to my stuffed animals sometimes when I'm alone. I've been trying to drop the habit, but it's hard to do so... Meguru: Is that weird? Meguru: Ugh... I figured. I want to get rid of that habit. I've been trying hard to drop it, but... old habits die hard, I guess. Shuuji: Well, I'm sure you can if you keep trying. Meguru: Right! Yeah, I'll give it my best! Shuuji: What's the problem? You don't have to stop if you don't want to. Meguru: Really? Shuuji: Just maybe don't go around advertising the fact. Shuuji: Though, I'm totally cool with it. Meguru: Thank you for saying so. Shuuji: So, should we go with Inaba-san's request, then? Nene: Umm... Can you eat \"sheaths\"? Isn't that the stuff that covers cables? I don't know of any food like that... Shuuji: Huh?! How did you get to \"sheath\"?! It's \"shisu\"! Nene: Huh? It's not sheath? Then, am I the only one who doesn't know what this \"shisu\" is? Meguru: I wouldn't say that... It's something people used to say decades ago. \"Shisu\" is basically... Meguru: Man, having to explain your joke like this is really embarrassing. Shuuji: It'll be easier to just go and show her. Let's head to a shisu place. Looks like Ayachi-san is interested enough. Nene: Oh, I see. \"Shisu\" is a transposition cipher of \"sushi.\" Now it all makes sense. Meguru: T-Transposition cipher? S-Senpai, what the heck is that? Now I feel like the stupid one. Shuuji: Huh? It's a form of encryption where characters or group of characters are shifted. Meguru: Another critical hit?! I'm the only stupid one here?! Shuuji: Ayachi-san, are you okay with sushi? Conveyor belt sushi, even. Nene: Yes, I'm okay with this. I'm looking forward to it, actually. I've never been to a sushi restaurant like this before. Meguru: Oh, really?

It's about time for me to head home too. Shuuji: Sorry I dragged you along with me. And thanks. Wakana: You're welcome. Okay then, good luck. Shuuji: See ya. Nene: The sun is starting to set. What does Kawakami-kun's schedule say from here on? Shuuji: Nothing special. They'll eat dinner together somewhere, then he'll see her home. Meguru: And where does he plan on eating? Shuuji: He put down a somewhat fancy place. Let's see... Ah, this one. Look, it's this one in the pamphlet.  Nene: This restaurant, huh... Meguru: It looks pretty expensive. Shuuji: I don't think the prices will be that outrageous, but yeah, it doesn't seem cheap. I guess he wants to make their first date something special. Meguru: I get that, but this might be going too far... Nene: Maeda-san would get nervous and worry about the price if it's too expensive. Shuuji: Yeah, but he'll be covering the bill, won't he? Meguru: But then she'll feel like she's mooching off of him. I don't think Maeda-san would be happy with that. Shuuji: I see. Nene: Wouldn't somewhere you can relax be better? A place more fitting for students. Meguru: I know how Kawakami-kun feels, but yeah... I think she'd accept an average-tasting dinner if it means she can have a good time with him, yeah? Shuuji: Hmm... You have a point. What about ramen, then? Meguru: No. Ramen is a clear no-go. Nene: As a girl, I'm sure she'll dress up for her first date, so she would be worried about the broth spatters. Food with a strong smell is also bad for the same reason. Shuuji: Then what about... a Raizeriya? The food is good, it's cheap, and it's got a pretty casual atmosphere. Meguru: Sure, the food is good there and it's fitting for students. But going to a cheap chain restaurant on the first date...? Well, I'm sure Maeda-san would be okay with that. Nene: It might be Kawakami-kun who has a problem with that, since he planned out this date so meticulously. Shuuji: True... He's a guy, after all. He has his pride. Meguru: I guess Kawakami-kun can keep his choice as a last resort, but he should play it safe and ask her where she'd like to go first. Meguru: After all, what you feel like eating depends on your mood. Nene: I agree. Shuuji: But then he'd get the old \"Anything goes,\" swiftly followed up by \"Really? THAT place?\" once you suggest something. Meguru: That's a pretty jaded outlook on women. I don't think Maeda-san would embarrass her date like that. Nene: And wouldn't a conversation about food preferences help liven things up? Meguru: You know it, Nene-senpai! Getting to know each other more like that is a nice thing. Nene: I believe the best way would be to discuss where to go together, with Kawakami-kun's choice being presented as an option. Shuuji: While we're at it, what are your thoughts on the whole date plan itself? Meguru: Hmm... It's okay, but it does feel like he's going for a little too much. Meguru: Things like going to the movies and window shopping are good and all, but it might be a little tiring with the lack of breaks. Nene: If he wants to go see that movie, it might be a good idea to relax in a cafe afterwards. Shuuji: I see. Nene: Apart from that, how about making sure he watches Maeda-san carefully? Shuuji: What do you mean? Nene: There's a lot to watch out for, such as not walking too fast. Her feet might start hurting depending on what shoes she wears. Meguru: On that note, you're walking too fast, Senpai. That's not good. Shuuji: Whoops... I wasn't thinking about that at all. Meguru: That kind of casual kindness makes girls pretty happy. Shuuji: I'll watch out for that from now on. Shuuji: Okay. I'll put all of our advice together in a text... Something like this, I guess? Meguru: Are you done? Shuuji: Yep. I also made sure to double-check it. Nothing important was left out. Nene: Well then, what shall we do now? Go home? Meguru: Huh?! Go home?! I thought we were having dinner together, so I told my parents not to make me anything! Nene: Then I don't mind going somewhere to eat. Are you coming along, Hoshina-kun? Shuuji: I don't see why not. It would beat making something for myself at home. Meguru: Do you make your own dinners? Shuuji: Yeah. All the household tasks are my job. My mother passed away a while ago, so it's just me and my dad. Meguru: Oh. Umm... Shuuji: Don't worry, I don't mind talking about it. I actually really hate it when people get awkward about it. Meguru: O-Okay. Roger that. Shuuji: Eating out is alright on your end, Ayachi-san? Nene: Yes. I live by myself, so there won't be a problem. Meguru: You live by yourself? That's pretty cool! Nene: Really? I personally don't think it's anything that great. Shuuji: Yeah, I imagine the downsides outweigh the upsides. Shuuji: Sure, but what should we eat? Nene: I'm fine with anything. There's nothing I dislike. Shuuji: What are you in the mood for, though? Anything you've been craving? Meguru: Oh, I know! Give me a \"shi\"! Give me a \"su\"! It's \"shisu\"! Shuuji: How old are you, again? Are you my grandmother? Who says it like that these days? Meguru: Hey, I'm a lovely young maiden! My stuffed animals tell me so every night! Shuuji: ...You still talk to your stuffed animals? Meguru: Huh? Oh... I kinda talk to my stuffed animals sometimes when I'm alone. I've been trying to drop the habit, but it's hard to do so... Meguru: Is that weird? Meguru: Ugh... I figured. I want to get rid of that habit. I've been trying hard to drop it, but... old habits die hard, I guess. Shuuji: Well, I'm sure you can if you keep trying. Meguru: Right! Yeah, I'll give it my best! Shuuji: What's the problem? You don't have to stop if you don't want to. Meguru: Really? Shuuji: Just maybe don't go around advertising the fact. Shuuji: Though, I'm totally cool with it. Meguru: Thank you for saying so. Shuuji: So, should we go with Inaba-san's request, then? Nene: Umm... Can you eat \"sheaths\"? Isn't that the stuff that covers cables? I don't know of any food like that... Shuuji: Huh?! How did you get to \"sheath\"?! It's \"shisu\"! Nene: Huh? It's not sheath? Then, am I the only one who doesn't know what this \"shisu\" is? Meguru: I wouldn't say that... It's something people used to say decades ago. \"Shisu\" is basically... Meguru: Man, having to explain your joke like this is really embarrassing. Shuuji: It'll be easier to just go and show her. Let's head to a shisu place. Looks like Ayachi-san is interested enough. Nene: Oh, I see. \"Shisu\" is a transposition cipher of \"sushi.\" Now it all makes sense. Meguru: T-Transposition cipher? S-Senpai, what the heck is that? Now I feel like the stupid one. Shuuji: Huh? It's a form of encryption where characters or group of characters are shifted. Meguru: Another critical hit?! I'm the only stupid one here?! Shuuji: Ayachi-san, are you okay with sushi? Conveyor belt sushi, even. Nene: Yes, I'm okay with this. I'm looking forward to it, actually. I've never been to a sushi restaurant like this before. Meguru: Oh, really? Nene: I almost never eat out. I'm getting rather excited! Nene: Is that so? Wow, amazing... Meguru: That's a big fat lie. Stop trying to trick her into embarrassing herself, Senpai.

Shuuji: You want me to carve some pumpkins and make jack-o'-lanterns? Nene: Yes. I'd appreciate it. Tsumugi: What about us? It might be tough for Hoshina-kun to handle that by himself. Should we help? Nene: No, carving pumpkins is tough physical work, so the boys from the Student Council will be helping with that. Meguru: Should we handle the decorations then? Nene: Yes. Togakushi-senpai and Koshiji-san are out making purchases right now. We'll start decorating the gym once they come back. Tsumugi: And in the afternoon we'll make the cookies and pudding? Nene: Yes. That's the plan. Meguru: Alright! We're in the home stretch! Let's get to it! Student Council Member A: Oh, thanks. Shuuji: Just one more jack-o'-lantern left per person. Anyway, here are some more pumpkin guts. Touko: Thank you. Shuuji: How are things going on your side? Touko: It's quite strenuous. Shuuji: Do you need more people? Touko: Nah. There are just a lot of batches we have to make. Throwing more people at the problem won't help. Touko: You know, Inaba-san is actually pretty good at cooking. She's really impressive. She's quick and her food tastes great. The guests are gonna love it. Shuuji: That sounds great. I'm expecting some great snacks from her now. Touko: Oh right. Speaking of expectations, how are things looking on your end? For your band, I mean. Shuuji: Ugh. Touko: Hm? Is something wrong? Shuuji: Yeah. The pressure is starting to get to me... Touko: You're a boy, so stop talking like a wimp. I'm expecting you to look cool up there on stage! Mufufu. Shuuji: You're just adding on even more pressure. Please stop. Touko: If just my expectations are putting that much pressure on you, how are you gonna play in front of a crowd? Man up. Shuuji: I get your point, but... I never go to events like these in the first place. Shuuji: But now I suddenly have to perform on stage? My heart is pounding like crazy. Shuuji: You don't get nervous when appearing before a crowd? Touko: Hmm... I just got used to it after a while. Touko: Oh, I know! How about this? Give yourself a reward if your performance is a success. Shuuji: Reward myself? Touko: Yup, that's right. Something like treating yourself to a fancy meal, for example. Touko: After all, motivation is important. Touko: Oh, I said \"motivation,\" okay? Not \"masturbation.\" A bad pun like that would be really unnecessary. Shuuji: You're right. It WAS totally unnecessary! Shuuji: It was fine advice. I just can't think of anything that would motivate me. Touko: Oh. Well, I'm sure it's hard to think of something on the spot. Touko: Alrighty! New plan. If you kick butt up there on stage, I'll personally give you a reward. Shuuji: You? To me? Touko: Did that maybe get you a little too motivated? Mufufu. Shuuji: I don't know if \"motivated\" is the right word... Touko: I just hope you aren't expecting anything too much, or anything sexual. Anyway, do your best up there! Touko: Alright, I should get back to work. You keep it up as well. Meguru: Tadaaa! What do you think? Meguru: Rawr! I'm gonna eat you up! Just kidding! Shuuji: Ooh, that looks great on you. Meguru: You think? I'm a little embarrassed... Ehehe. Shuuji: Not just the looks. It really fits your cheerful personality. Meguru: Thank you. Your costume looks good on you too. Shuuji: Oh, I dunno about that. There's nothing special about it. Shuuji: I guess. Meguru: Nene-senpai, you look great in your costume too. Nene: Thank you. Though, I'm not used to wearing this kind of outfit, so I'm a little nervous. Shuuji: Yeah? Shuuji: Er, it's nothing. I wasn't thinking anything weird at all.  Nene: Are you sure? Nene: Because I was pretty sure you were thinking \"you wear even more revealing clothes all the time.\" Shuuji: ...Ugh, the look you're giving me hurts. Please stop. Nene: I know... Don't remind me about how I have to dress in such a ridiculous and embarrassing outfit... Shuuji: Well, you look great in your current costume, at least. You shouldn't feel embarrassed by that. Shuuji: What's it supposed to be, though? Nene: I don't think it's supposed to be anything in particular. I think it's just a normal gothic dress. Gothic outfits are normal for Halloween. Shuuji: Yeah? That's new to me. Good to know. Nene: But... Does it really look okay? It doesn't look strange on me? Like... I didn't put it on the wrong way? It doesn't look awful on me? Shuuji: I don't think you have anything to worry about. You look great. Shuuji: I'm positive you'll draw a lot of attention in that, in a good way. You almost look too good in it. So don't worry. Nene: Yeah? Thank you... very much. Shuuji: You're welcome. "

It also means I'll have to give up on being able to do magic at all.

            "Shuuji: Man, what the hell's going on? Nanao: ...... Nene: It's really unusual to see you look so conflicted.  Nanao: That's how important this is.  Nene: So... what did you want to discuss?  Nanao: ...Right.  Nanao: Do you remember the exact wish you made with me when we formed your contract?  Nene: Well... Naturally. It was that I didn't want my parents' divorce to have happened.  Nanao: No, that wasn't everything. What you said to me was something along the lines of \"I want to reverse my parents' divorce and redo things as a family, without any fighting.\" Nene: Oh... I guess I did. But that seems to be relatively the same thing to me... Does that addition pose any problem? Nanao: ...I guess you haven't realized yet.  Nene: ......? What are you talking about? Nanao: ...... Nanao: What I'm about to tell you is very important, Nene, so listen closely.  Nene: Okay... What is it? Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Everything would be okay if that was it... But I'm not gonna be able to sleep until I know she's safe. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Guess I'll text her. Shuuji: Did something bad happen? Tsumugi: Hey, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Hey there.  Tsumugi: If you're looking for Ayachi-san, she isn't here yet.  Shuuji: Oh, thanks... Tsumugi: ...Did something happen? Shuuji: Hm? What makes you think that?  Tsumugi: I don't know... You had this really serious look on your face. You guys didn't have a fight or something, did you? Shuuji: Oh no, we didn't. We're still on good terms, so don't worry. Tsumugi: That's a relief then... But know that you can always come and talk to me if you have a problem. Shuuji: Thanks, Shiiba-san. Hideaki: Yeah, it's weird. Though, there was that day a week or two ago when she got sick... Maybe it came back? Tsumugi: Who can say. It was only a stomach ache, though, so I don't think it'd be that again. Wakana: Man, what happened to her... Really? Hideaki: Did she not tell you anything, man? Shuuji: Nope.  Wakana: Have you texted her?  Shuuji: I was actually just going to do that... Wakana: Ah, Ayachi-san. Hey.  Tsumugi: What took so long? You're pretty late today.  Nene: There was just a little place I had to swing by before coming to school.  Hideaki: Good to hear. We were worried you might be sick.  Nene: I'm sorry I got you so concerned. It really was only that, so you don't need to worry.  Wakana: Hmm, but aren't your eyes a little red?  Nene: Are they? I got plenty of sleep last night... Well, maybe I just read for a bit too long. Tsumugi: Make sure to take care of your body. Reading is all fine and good, but remember to take breaks.  Nene: Thank you. I'll be careful about that. Shuuji: Ah, yeah, morning. Nene: I need to apologize for yesterday. I fell asleep without giving you a reply text.  Shuuji: Nah, I don't mind. But are you really alright? You can tell me if something's up. Nene: No, that's not the case. I'm fine. So don't worry. Shuuji: ...... Nene: Huh? What, um, makes you say that? Shuuji: Oh, I just smelled coffee on you. Was I wrong? Nene: ...No, you weren't. I had to talk to Nanao. Shuuji: An extension of the talk from yesterday?  Nene: It wasn't anything worth mentioning. But anyhow, I have something to tell you... Shuuji: ......? What is it? Nene: (I made lunch for us again, so come to the clubroom during lunch break.) Shuuji: O-Okay. Got it. Shuuji: Thanks, Nene. Nene: I put my best effort into it, so everything should taste fine.  Shuuji: Thanks. I'm gonna go ahead and get started, if you don't mind.  Nene: Umm, if you could wait one moment before that. Shuuji: Huh? I... can eat it, right?  Nene: Of course. I made it so you could, but well... Before you start eating, do you remember what you mentioned to me last time? Shuuji: No, what did I say?  Nene: Umm... You wanted me to feed you. Shuuji: Oh, right. Now that you mention it, I did say that. Shuuji: Are you saying... You'd actually be willing to do that?  Nene: If it's something you truly want, then... I'd like to make you happy.  Nene: We've already done all the things I barred us from doing back then―kissing, hugging, and holding hands―but I remembered that feeding you was also one of those.  Shuuji: ...... Nene: Ah! If you have more you'd like to do, don't hesitate to say so. I'm ready to do anything I can. Nene: Or alternatively, if you get the urge to any of the things we've already done again... I wouldn't mind that either.  Shuuji: Th-Thanks. I'll keep that in mind.  Nene: So... Do you want me to feed you? Or no? Shuuji: Well, since you offered... I guess I'll take you up on that.  Nene: Of course. Well, then... What do you want first? Are the omelet rolls fine?  Shuuji: Sure, I'll have one.  Nene: Alright. Now say \"ahhhhh.\" Shuuji: Ahhhh. Nene: That's wonderful. Shuuji: Okay, that means it's my turn to feed you now. Umm, if you'll let me.  Nene: What?! I-I have to do that... too? Shuuji: You don't want to? Nene: Urk... D-Do you really want to feed me? Shuuji: Yeah, I really do.  Nene: ...O-Okay. If you're ready, then... A-Ahhhh... Shuuji: Here you go. Nene: Nmhh... *munch* *munch*... Nene: It's too embarrassing opening your mouth this wide at someone. It feels vulgar. I've never done something like that be― Nene: ―Or I guess I actually have. Just the other day... I had to put your big, thick thing in my... Back then, my mouth was open really wide... Nene: G-Gosh! Don't make me say weird stuff while we're eating! Now it's in my head! Shuuji: How did you even get there from something as simple as \"opening your mouth\"?! I swear, you're worse than some horny boy in puberty! Nene: Ugh... urk... Fine. Let's stop talking about this and get back to our food.  Nene: You're very welcome.  Shuuji: It was absolutely delicious.  Nene: Hearing that makes it all worth it.  Nene: Is there anything else you want to do now that we're here? I-If you... want to, we could even do... s-sexual things. Shuuji: What?! U-Umm... so... y-you really mean that? Nene: ......... Nene: Wh-Why not?  Shuuji: You get too embarrassed about it.  Nene: I'm embarrassed right now too! But, well... Girls like to have sex too... And I have as much interest in it as the average person.  Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Can I start with a kiss?  Nene: S-Sure. Of course you can... I'd never refuse a kiss from my boyfriend... Nene: Mh, mh, fuuh... *kiss* *kiss* mh *kiss* Shuuji: *kiss*... I love you, Nene. Nene: Nmh *kiss* mhh, I love you, too... I love you so, so much... mh, mhhh *kiss* Nene: Umm... Is something the matter? Why did you stop? Shuuji: ...... Nene: Are you okay, Shuuji-kun? Nene: Was my kiss... bad, perhaps? I'm really sorry... I'm a beginner, so I'm still learning. And well, it's not something you can just practice in your free time. Shuuji: No, not that. Nene: Was it the lunch, then? Shuuji: No, it was great. I meant what I said. Nene: ...Then what? If there's something bothering you, you can tell me.  Shuuji: ...... Nene: You... don't want to? Is it something I wouldn't be able to help with? Nene: You've so much for me already... I want to be able to help the person I love, too. Nene: Am I not good enough? Can I not support you?  Shuuji: Nene, you're not acting yourself. Forget about me, are you okay?  Nene: ...... Shuuji: Something happened, didn't it? You wouldn't normally be in tears after a kiss.  Nene: Huh? Nene: Of course not. I'd never think of it.  Shuuji: Then do you not love me anymore? Nene: No, that's purely impossible. I only come to love you more and more with each passing day.  Shuuji: Then why are you crying, Nene? Nene: Well, umm... Shuuji: You look so sad. It's like... You're desperately trying to be useful to me. Like you think I don't like you or something.  Nene: ......... Shuuji: I'm sorry for being so persistent. It's just... I felt like I'd only keep hurting you if I didn't say anything.  Shuuji: So please, tell me... Is there something about being with me that's causing you pain? Nene: ...No, no, there's nothing like that. I'm the one who needs to apologize to you.  Shuuji: Why?  Nene: I'm sorry. I'm just... so, so sorry.  Shuuji: ...It's okay, Nene. Just take a deep breath and calm down.  Nene: I'm sorry... I promise I really do want to be with you. I love you. I really do. Nene: But that's exactly what makes it so... Nene: ...Right. Shuuji: Good evening. Nanao: Hoshina-kun. And... Nene. Nene: ...... Nanao: ...Alright.  Nanao: Give me a few minutes to put away the signboard and close up the shop. This might take a bit of time.  Shuuji: ...Sure. Nanao: Alright then, hope I didn't keep you waiting for too long. So, where should we start? Have you told him anything, Nene? Nene: No. Nanao: Okay... I'll start from the beginning, then. Though, a lot of this you might already know, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Okay.  Nanao: So first off, let's recap what we went over yesterday... The remaining fragments in you will eventually return to Nene on their own.  Nanao: When that happens, Nene's will reach the amount necessary to fill her bottle.  Shuuji: Yeah, I remember that. And that means she can have her wish granted?  Nanao: Yep, exactly.  Shuuji: So why is she acting so grief-stricken if her wish is coming true?  Nanao: ...... Nanao: ...Do you know what exactly her wish is? Shuuji: Hm, not the fine details or anything. Just that it's related to her parents' divorce. Nanao: Yeah, that's the gist of it. The exact wish was \"I want to reverse my parents' divorce and redo things as a family, without any fighting.\" Shuuji: Okay... So what about it? Nanao: ...Think closely about what exactly that wish entails. Shuuji: ...... Nanao: ...As you know, Nene's parents are already divorced. So what Nene wished for was for their divorce, which occurred years ago, to have never happened.  Nanao: See, what she wants isn't for them to reconcile and come back together. Nanao: She herself also has regrets with regards to how she treated her step-mother. So, that \"redo\" she wants will involve her own self, as well as her parents. I'm sure you see where this is going... Nanao: Once the necessary fragment amount is reached, Nene will more than likely undergo a time travel in the process of her wish becoming reality. Shuuji: A time travel? Nanao: Or do they call it a time leap? Anyhow, I'm assuming she'll return to a time in the past when her parents were yet to be divorced.   Nene: ......... Shuuji: So if she goes back in time to redo things... Then what happens to us in the present right now? Nanao: Probably nothing at all will change. With the exception of Nene, that is. Shuuji: So, wait... What happens to the Nene living here with us right now? Nanao: ...... Nanao: ...She'll disappear. Shuuji: What...? Nanao: Ayachi Nene's very existence will be erased from this world. Shuuji: ...What do you mean, erased? Nanao: Even if we assume that only her consciousness travels back in time, it would lead to a time paradox, since we'd have a Nene still here whose wish had never been granted.  Nanao: And order to get rid of that contradiction, the magic will likely have to forcibly alter the time continuum of our world... Erasing Nene in the process.  Shuuji: Hold on a second! Is that really what...?! Nene, Nanao: \"......\" Nanao: I only know as much as you do. But we can be certain that she'll be erased from the memories of every single person that knew her.  Shuuji: From their memories...? Does that also include me? Nanao: ...It does. The one unknown factor is what'll happen to Nene's body if it stays here.  Nanao: She might be rewritten as a completely different person, or even transplanted to an entirely different place on the globe... Heck, her body might just disappear completely. Shuuji: No way... Shuuji: Is there no way to cancel the contract, or change it... or anything? Nanao: ...Of course not. The magic engraved itself into her very soul the moment she signed that contract. Nanao: Once the mana it needs is there, it'll probably go ahead and activate on its own... And before we know it, Nene will be gone.  Nanao: The foundation of this magic, the very thing that allows them to exist and grow, is strong, deep desires from the heart.   Nanao: When Nene found me and made the contract, she had no one. It was a few years after the divorce, and she was having trouble fitting in with her new family. She felt unwanted, like she had no place to belong in this world.  Nanao: Her very person and identity revolved around her intense desire to \"go back\" and \"redo\" things. You can't change the magic at this point. It's already formed... Nene: ...... Nene: No! It's in no way your fault... It was me... I should've known better than to make such a careless wish... Nene: You've done so much thus far, all for me. And... It makes me happy to see the person you've become.  "

Nene: I'm sorry, but I really don't feel like playing games after all that... Nene: Besides... Nene: I-It's just you. Right, Hoshina-kun? Shuuji: Yeah, don't be silly. C'mon, you'll get left behind if you don't hurry up. Meguru: ...Hey, don't just gloss over my question like that. Shuuji: We're not glossing over anything. Anyway, where's my bag? Meguru: ......

Meguru: Oh, our hands... Shuuji: You're just now realizing that? Meguru: Y-Yeah. I just kinda grabbed your hand without thinking. Sorry! Shuuji: It's not like I mind... Shuuji: Umm... So what do you want to talk about? Meguru: Oh, r-right! About that, umm... Shuuji: What? Meguru: I mean y-you're unfair! Meguru: I wanna get along with Nene-senpai too! Shuuji: ...What? Meguru: It feels like you been talking to each other behind everyone's backs! Meguru: You've been talking with THE Nene-senpai! She's cute, pretty, has a great figure, is classy but nice... but she still keeps everyone at a distance. Everyone but you, it seems! Meguru: That's so not fair! Meguru: N-No, I wouldn't go that far. I'd feel bad asking about that... Shuuji: Yeah? Meguru: Senpai, how have you gotten so close with Nene-senpai? Shuuji: Right, umm... Shuuji: Hmm... If you wanna be better friends with her, shouldn't you have gone home with her instead of dragging me off somewhere? Meguru: W-Well yeah, I guess, but... Shuuji: Though, if it were that easy, we wouldn't be here right now. Meguru: Y-Yeah! Right! Shuuji: But you know, the way I see it is that you're the one who's closer to Ayachi-san. Shuuji: It's not like I can hug Ayachi-san like you do. Meguru: Well, no duh! Guys can't just hug girls out of nowhere! That'd be so wrong! Shuuji: Can't exactly say no to that. Ayachi-san is pretty hot... Meguru: Ugh... You're such a creeper sometimes. Seriously, how can you say that? Shuuji: You're the one who asked me that! Any guy would feel the same way. It's not like we act on every urge we get! Meguru: Looking at it the other way around, all I can do is hug her and nothing else. Shuuji: What do you mean by that? Meguru: W-Well, you know... We never chat alone in the clubroom during lunch break, for example. Shuuji: So that really has been weighing on your mind... We didn't talk about anything special there, okay? Meguru: Th-That doesn't make it any less unfair. I'm still just as jealous knowing that! Meguru: Remember what I said yesterday? I just want all of my friendships to be deep. That's why! Shuuji: Hmm... Meguru: But like I just mentioned, Nene-senpai always seems kinda distant, you know? So it's hard to just up and ask her. Meguru: What if she went all, \"You want me to eat lunch with you? Why would I do that?\" I'd die from shock. Shuuji: ...Yeah, that's tough. Shuuji: Okay. I'll do what I can. Meguru: ...!! Shuuji: Err, I think it's a bit early to be thanking me. Meguru: Whatcha mean? Shuuji: While I'd love to help you, I'm not actually sure how I got so close to Ayachi-san. Shuuji: So I don't have a clue where to start. Meguru: What?! Meguru: Th-That's not true! You're like super close! You've even been communicating with eye contact alone! Meguru: That's the whole reason I said this is unfair! Shuuji: Well, I'm glad you think so, but I dunno what to do... Shuuji: Like you said earlier, there's an inherent difference in how we can interact with her since I'm a guy and you're a girl. I doubt my approach would work for you. Meguru: You got close with her in a way only a guy can...? Meguru: W-Wait! Is that why you understand each other so well?! I mean, like, your relationship has gotten ph-ph-physical?! Shuuji: Whoa, whoa! Hold on! You're way off-base! Why are you taking things in that direction?! Meguru: Don't put this on me! You're the one who made it sound like that! Shuuji: I didn't! That was all you! Anyway, just calm down. Let's get some drinks at the vending machine over there. Shuuji: That's what I want to say... *sip* Anyway, that was just a misunderstanding on your part.  Meguru: Yeah, I know. There's no way that'd be true now that I think about it. Shuuji: Would've been nice if you thought that through sooner... Would have saved me some money on the drinks. Meguru: Ah, speaking of, is the milk tea you got any good? I had a hard time deciding between that and this coffee. Shuuji: I'd say it's better than the kind they have at school. Meguru: Hmm... Maybe I should've went with the milk tea instead. Shuuji: Want a taste? Meguru: Of course not! That would be an... i-i-indirect kiss! Shuuji: Oh... Y-Yeah, I guess so. Meguru: Geez, why are you always like this? There's no way a dolt like you could get close with Nene-senpai! Shuuji: Isn't that different from what you said earlier? Meguru: ...So please tell me how you got so close to her while being such a dolt. Shuuji: Err, like I said, I have no idea. Meguru: You are no help at all... Shuuji: Oh, give me a break. Let me think... Meguru: I won't drink that even if you wipe the rim clean. Shuuji: Forget about that already. What I'm saying is... Shuuji: Why not just go and visit Ayachi-san right now? Meguru: ...... Shuuji: And then when you're there, suggest staying the night. Meguru: ...Y-You mean, just me? Shuuji: Of course. You want to get closer to her, right? Meguru: N-No way! Shuuji: You mean you don't want to get closer to her?! Meguru: No, I do! But you want me to stay the night with her?! Meguru: Visiting her by myself would be hard enough for me... Shuuji: And yet you have no qualms hanging out at my place... Meguru: Th-That's because it's you. Meguru: R-Right. Meguru: But, umm, the idea itself is good. Sleeping over at Nene-senpai's place is like a dream for me. Shuuji: Okay, then with that goal in mind, how about you work towards getting closer to her starting tomorrow? Meguru: Ugh... Can I really do this? Shuuji: Well, how about you come and stay over at my place as practice? Meguru: AS IF!! Shuuji: Well, with that settled, let's pick this back up tomorrow. Meguru: O-Okay. See you tomorrow. Meguru: Umm... Thank you, Senpai. Shuuji: You can show your thanks by staying the night at my place. Meguru: What?! Are you serious?! Are you in super-perv Senpai mode right now?! Are you after me or something?! Shuuji: Nah, just kidding. Meguru: You've got a real messed up sense of humor... Taichi: Okay. Take care. Shuuji: ...Good morning. Meguru: Yeah! I figured you'd eventually pass by here. Shuuji: ...Why, though? Meguru: Hey! What kind of reaction is that? Meguru: Didn't you tell me you'd help me yesterday? Shuuji: Oh yeah, I guess that makes sense... Shuuji: Sorry. I was just a little taken aback. Meguru: ...Senpai? Shuuji: Oh, it's nothing. Let's walk while we talk. Meguru: Yeah! Roger that. Shuuji: We'll end up at school in no time if we follow my regular route though. Shuuji: So at the risk of sounding boring, let's take the same detour as yesterday. Shuuji: Should we not have taken a detour? Meguru: No, that was actually a good idea. Meguru: ...It just feels strange heading to school with you. Shuuji: Even though you were waiting to ambush me... Meguru: I-I know. And did you have to put it like that? You make me sound like a bad guy! Shuuji: Anyway, if you have no problem with the detour, then let's get down to business. Shuuji: We need to talk about how you should get closer to Ayachi-san. Meguru: Y-Yeah. Shuuji: So, to make sure, is the goal still being able to sleep over at her place? Meguru: Yeah, we can go with that. Meguru: I kinda got really flustered yesterday, but after thinking about it calmly, it doesn't seem too hard to do. Shuuji: If it's that easy, then can't you do this without my help? Meguru: Th-That's not how I meant it! You can't back out now! You already promised me you'd help! Meguru: Good! Meguru: You know, for how cold you seem, you're surprisingly nice. Shuuji: How am I supposed to take that? Meguru: As a compliment. Shuuji: O-Okay, thanks... Anyhow... Shuuji: The way I see it, getting used to interacting with her is the only way. Meguru: Right. I agree with that. Shuuji: And so, your first step should be― Meguru: Ne... N-N-Nene-senpai! Meguru: Good mornifsh! Nene: It's unusual to see you here in the morning. Meguru: Y-Yesh. Tru dat! Nene: ......?? Meguru: Not at all! Just saying good morninf! Meguru: Hoshina-senpai invited me, so I figured I would swing by... Nene: Okay...? Meguru: Helloha! Nene: ...Yes. Helloha to you as well. Meguru: ...... Nene: ...... "

            "Taichi: Uh, hello? You're burning the meat. Shuuji: Huh? Oh, crap! Shuuji: Yeah, you're right. Sorry. Taichi: Thanks for the food. So, something troubling you? Shuuji: Yeah... Dad, has anyone ever asked you, \"what's more important, your work or me\"? Taichi: Where did that come from? Oh, wait, did you actually get a girlfriend? Shuuji: No, this isn't about me. I'm talking about someone else. They came to ask me for help. Taichi: What, really? Man, we really won't be getting a grandchild, darling... Shuuji: You don't need to tell Mom stuff like that. Taichi: The fact that people are coming to you for help shows that you've grown, though. Maybe my dreams really will come true... Taichi: Not with your mother; she was too kind a woman. But someone else did ask me that once. Shuuji: Yeah? How'd you answer? Taichi: I said, \"Let me ask you this: would you prefer me having a job, or being unemployed?\" Shuuji: And then what happened? Taichi: She got really angry and yelled, \"That's not the point here!\" We broke up shortly after. I still don't really understand what happened. Shuuji: You broke up? That's it? Taichi: Yeah. She kept asking me questions like that. Let me tell you, there's no dealing with a woman like that! Shuuji: Yeah... I dunno how I'd think about that. Sounds like it'd be a pain. Taichi: Don't act so picky if you've never even dated anyone. Shuuji: That's harsh, man... Taichi: So, why do you ask? Shuuji: Well, the two of them love each other, but they're struggling to let each other know how they feel. I can't see a solution to the problem. Shuuji: Even if you love someone, you've gotta work, right? But what are you meant to do so that your relationship doesn't fall apart? Taichi: Without just breaking up? Shuuji: Preferably. Taichi: Let's see, then... One thing you could do is take a day off from work and spend that time with your partner. Shuuji: A day off, you say... Taichi: And I don't just mean take them to your work with you. They'd ditch for sure if you did that. Taichi: It's only a temporary fix, but it's a good way to keep both parties happy. Though, the problems will end up coming round again. Shuuji: Yeah... You're right. Taichi: Nothing will change if you keep working the same hours. If it becomes too much of a problem, the two of them are better off breaking up and finding partners who suit their needs more. Taichi: But some people don't want anything to be more important than themselves. That can easily become an irreconcilable difference. It's just who they are, at a fundamental level. Shuuji: Isn't that a little extreme? Taichi: I'm sure even you get lonely and maybe even jealous when you see one of your few friends being friendly with their other friends, right? It's the same in love. Shuuji: Sure, I get lonely, but... jealous? Taichi: Think about if you only had one friend, but that friend had many others. You'd just be one of his many friends. You'd most certainly feel jealous. That's normal. Shuuji: Hmm... Yeah, I guess. Taichi: That's the same kind of situation. If you don't want your partner to be like that, then no amount of talking will fix things. It's a problem with who they are at a basic level. Shuuji: But I doubt you're going to find anyone that perfect, are you? Taichi: Most people get like that, yes. But what's most important is forgiveness and the will to stick together. Shuuji: ...You know, you're pretty smart, Dad. Taichi: Having kids will make you grow up in a hurry. Especially for me, since I have to manage people in my work too. Taichi: Though, I've learned all this after school. It's probably different while you're still there. Taichi: You need to give up on talking this one through. Unless you can change these people's personalities, you're just smoothing over the cracks in the foundation. Meguru: I do! Nene: Okay then, Inaba-san. Meguru: We'll have her confront him! \"Which is more important, me or your team?!\" Shuuji: %130;Are you trying to make things worse?! Meguru: ...Is that a bad idea? Shuuji: Definitely. They'd break up for sure after that! Meguru: Huh, that's weird... It worked in the dating sim I played the other day. I fixed the characters' relationship and got the good ending. Shuuji: 2D and 3D are completely different! Tsumugi: Okay... We could have them set up days with mandatory dates. Like, several times a month. Tsumugi: They have to come to a compromise. Obviously, it's okay for him to focus on basketball, but he needs to spend what extra time he has with his girlfriend. Tsumugi: This way no one has to give up completely on anything, right? Touko: That might work... But don't you think it would put a lot of pressure on Shiba-kun? Shuuji: And wouldn't it be awkward for them to be forced on a date? Tsumugi: Well... I guess. Higo-san might worry about him only being there because he has to. Shuuji: Have your games and manga given you any other ideas, Inaba-san? Ones that don't involve a dramatic confrontation, preferably. Meguru: Errm, let's see... The problem here is that basketball is taking up too much of his time... Meguru: Even though Higo-san's a girl? Touko: She could be the manager. Nene: They would be able to spend time together if she did. Tsumugi: But that doesn't fix their lack of dates, does it? Touko: That's true... Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Actually... Shuuji: That might be a good idea. Meguru: Senpai? Shuuji: The fundamental problem here is that the two of them don't have anything in common that's important to the both of them. Shuuji: Then they'd be sharing a common purpose, a goal they can work together toward. Don't you think Shiba-kun would be happy about that? Tsumugi: She'll start off caring about that one member most, but I'm sure she'll want to support the whole team on their road to the Nationals once she sees how hard they're working. Meguru: I think it's a good idea. Having your girlfriend as your manager, then taking her to the Nationals... That makes for such a good story! Tsumugi: If they agree to this, it would be the easiest solution, right? Touko: But having your girlfriend around might be distracting too. Particularly for his lower muscles♪ Mufufu. Shuuji: ...Togakushi-senpai, a girl your age shouldn't be saying that stuff. Touko: But you're blushing. I bet you're imagining it, aren't you? You naughty boy. Shuuji: I'm not the only one with a red face. Just look at Inaba-san. Meguru: Hey, what are you bringing me into this for?! Tsumugi-senpai's face is just as red! Tsumugi: Whaaa?! D-Don't get me involved too! Touko: Mufufu, maybe you two are just as perverted as him? Meguru: I-I am not perverted! I most certainly am not! Tsumugi: M-Me neither! Anyway, we're trying to solve a problem here! Does anyone have any other ideas?! I think we should go with Hoshina-kun's suggestion! Meguru: N-No objections from me! None at all! Touko: I agree too. Nene: Very well. Then I'll let Higo-san know how Shiba-kun feels and suggest that she joins the basketball club. Nene: Hoshina-kun, Togakushi-senpai, could you go and talk to Shiba-kun for me? Touko: Sure, you got it. Basketball Club Member: Luckily for us, this girl here wishes to be our manager! Student: I'm Higo Mayuko. I'm a beginner when it comes to basketball, but I'll work my hardest to give you all the support you need! Student: But I've never been a manager before... Won't I just get in the way? Shuuji: For the two of them, at least... Basketball Club Member: Now we have double the motivation to win those finals! Basketball Club: Like hell we do! Basketball Club Member A: She's your girlfriend! Basketball Club Member C: Screw this. You're the only one motivated here! Basketball Club Member B: Bringing your love life to the team? Give me a break! Shuuji: The team looks like it's about to collapse... Shuuji: We should have told them that she wasn't becoming a manager just so they'd have more time to flirt... Touko: I think they know that better than anyone, don't you? Student: U-Umm! I plan on taking this seriously and working hard so that you can all get to the Nationals! Student: I've already made some drinks and bottled them up for you. I've also been learning how to bandage and ice injuries. I swear I'll do a great job! Basketball Club Member B: Drinks... A girl's homemade drinks... Basketball Club Member A: Bandaging... Icing... Basketball Club Member C: Skin contact... Basketball Club: Welcome to the team! Basketball Club Member: If any of you get any wise ideas, I'll kick the shit outta you! Shuuji: %130;They're that easy?! Shuuji: Now I feel like they'll break up for a completely different reason... Shuuji: Yeah, you're right. Touko: Love really is amazing. Mm... I'm even more interested in it. Shuuji: Is there anyone you're interested in, Senpai? Touko: Unfortunately not. I've never fallen for anyone before, I'm embarrassed to say... Touko: I called myself a beginner, but I'm actually even less than that. *sigh* I'm completely hopeless. Shuuji: I wouldn't get that down about it... Touko: I mean... I'm starting to worry that I'm simply not capable of love. I'm already this old without having my first love. Touko: I pine after love so badly, but I may never fall in love with anyone... Maybe I'm just destined to grow old and die alone? Shuuji: I don't think that's true. Touko: Really? Shuuji: People like that typically have no interest in love at all. Shuuji: But you're at least interested in love, Senpai, so I think you'll be okay. Touko: I hope you're right... Touko: To be honest, I joined the OC partly because I thought I could learn some more about love by helping people with their romantic troubles. Touko: But it just keeps getting more and more mysterious... It seems like something you have to experience for yourself to understand. Shuuji: Senpai... Maybe you're setting your ideals too high? Touko: Huh? Do I look the type to demand my boyfriend be hot, smart, and earning over a million yen a year? Shuuji: Oh, no, that's not what I meant. I wasn't talking about your ideals for men, but your ideals for love. Shuuji: The woman and her boyfriend that you see in your dreams look really happy, right? Touko: Yes, incredibly happy. Seeing them always makes me envious. Shuuji: Maybe you've seen so much of them that you now think love has to instantly make you as happy as them? Shuuji: That might not be a conscious thought, but something niggling in the back of your mind. Touko: Hmm... I wouldn't be surprised if it was. Shuuji: I'm sure you'll meet the man for you one day, Senpai. Someone who will be even better than your wildest love fantasies. Shuuji: Your love batteries are still charging, is all. Touko: You think so? Thank you. That made me feel a little better. Touko: Are your love batteries charging too then, Hoshina-kun? Shuuji: They certainly are. Touko: Nothing important. I was just thinking about how the two of us are different after all. Shuuji: Huh? You think? Touko: Yeah. Not just with your outlook on love, but with Higo-san's problem too. I never even thought about what was important to them, or if they needed to share something. Touko: I only brought up the idea of her becoming his manager at random. We might both be beginners when it comes to love, but there's still a big difference between us. Shuuji: Ohh, that's what you're talking about... Shuuji: I didn't do anything that great. I'm sure you could have come to the same conclusion if you had a bit longer to think about it. Touko: No way. I would never have thought of that. I'm too boring of a person. Shuuji: You're either being far too harsh on yourself or are way overestimating me here... Shuuji: Actually, I'm sorry! I've been misleading you! Touko: ...? What do you mean? Shuuji: Well, um, you see... Shuuji: All that stuff about what's important to people... I said it like I thought of it all myself, but I was actually just repeating what my dad told me. Shuuji: I was too embarrassed to say I had discussed it with my dad... Shuuji: I know I was overthinking it... But part of me also wanted to seem cool. Shuuji: I had to talk to my dad because I couldn't think of anything, either. So I really haven't done anything special. Touko: I see... That's a bit of a relief. Shuuji: It is? Touko: Yup, it is. I mean, during our date, I told you we were similar, didn't I? Shuuji: I'm sorry. It was all an act. We're similar after all. Touko: We're similar, huh... Shuuji: I'll be honest with you, Senpai... Most days I think to myself about how nice it would be if I had a girlfriend. Touko: ...... Touko: Hey, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Yes? Touko: At the OC we help people with their problems... Is it okay for us to help our fellow club members out when they have a problem? Shuuji: Well... That sounds fine to me. Don't see why it wouldn't be. Touko: Would that include an upperclassman's frivolous worries? Shuuji: It doesn't matter if your problems are frivolous or not. And it certainly doesn't matter if they're older or younger. Shuuji: We've never discriminated over who we help before, and we're not about to start now. Touko: I see... Touko: Then there's something I'd like to ask of you, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: ...Where are you going with this? Touko: Would you study with me? Shuuji: Study with you? I mean, I don't mind, but our midterms only just finished, so... Touko: Not that kind of studying. I'm talking about studying love. Shuuji: ......... Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: ... Shuuji: Come again? Touko: I'm asking if you'll study love with me? Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Whaaaaaaaaa?! "

It's only been two months since release! What the hell. You're seriously addicted. Meguru: Wha... What? Is something wrong with that? Shuuji: Oh, no, that's fine actually. I was just surprised, since I only have around 100 hours played so far. Shuuji: You should've said that you had a hobby like this! You can easily become popular in your class if you're that far into the game. Meguru: Y-You think? Shuuji: I do. And this would be the best time to take advantage of that. Shuuji: Your support during multiplayer was superb, so I'm positive that would work. Meguru: (Is this really going to work?) Meguru: (Should I actually start a quest? Or should I wait in the lobby? Wait, it'd be best to just play a quest normally instead of making it look like I'm waiting for someone to join, right?) Meguru: Ah, umm... M-MonHun.

How did you accomplish that? Shuuji: I found out that Inaba-san is actually good at games, so I figured she could use that to make friends. Nene: At games? Shuuji: Yeah. A game called Monster Huntsman, to be specific. Ever heard of it? Nene: No, sorry. I know next to nothing about games... Shuuji: Oh really? They're constantly running commercials for it on TV. Shuuji: Anyway, it's an action game where you fight huge monsters. Nene: Oh, okay. Shuuji: Thanks to that game, she instantly became the girl of the hour in her class.

I obviously wouldn't! But that's what the girls think. It doesn't make any sense. Shuuji: I didn't know so much drama could come from girls having boyish hobbies... That's crazy. Meguru: O-Oh no! Don't get me wrong. They just sorta feel that way. They aren't actively hating me or anything. Nene: You said it was some of the girls... Does that mean some others reacted positively? Meguru: Well, umm... Yeah. I've found girls I can play the game with. Nene: Is that so? That's great. What a relief. Shuuji: So I guess that means you've at least found a place in your class. I'm really happy to hear that. Meguru: But, umm... It might take some time for me to fully blend in... So if I need to talk or anything happens, would it be okay if I... stopped by again? Nene: Yes, we don't mind. Please come by again whenever you need us. Meguru: Thank you, Ayachi-senpai. Shuuji: So, that report was the reason you stopped by today? Meguru: That was one reason, yeah. But I'm mainly here for you. Shuuji: For me? Why? What do you mean? Meguru: You know. You still need more materials to craft the Pegasus equipment, don't you? So I'm here to help you. Shuuji: But shouldn't you do that with your class? Meguru: The boys had their 3DWs with them, but not the girls. And if I play too much with the boys, then, you know... Shuuji: Oh, right. Meguru: No, forget that! It's MonHun time, Senpai! You want those event items, right? Shuuji: Yeah, I do. Thanks! Shuuji: But, gee, I sure do suck, don't I? It would be a shame if I held you back! Meguru: I said I'm sorry already! Why do you have to keep bringing it up?! How spiteful can you be?! Meguru: Geeeeez! You're so annoying! You're so totally freaking annoyiiing! Shuuji: How dare you insult me!! "

I guess I have no choice. Shuuji: Shiiba-san, you're not...? Akagi: Gah?! Tsumugi: I really don't know what else I can say. Nene: Don't worry, I never believed that you would attack me to begin with. Tsumugi: Thank you. But I still ended up stealing the fragments that were meant for you. Nene: Now that they're in your bottle, there's nothing we can do about that. Nene: I know you didn't mean to. Tsumugi: I'm still sorry! I'm going to give Akagi a good talking to, so could you apologize to Souma-san for me? Nene: I'm sure she won't mind at all either. Tsumugi: Yeah, I hope so... Sorry to you too, Hoshina-kun. Tsumugi: I'm sure the raven that was chasing you around all day was Akagi. Shuuji: I agree with Ayachi-san. It's not your fault. Tsumugi: Yeah, but like... Akagi's my responsibility. Tsumugi: Thanks. Nene: Please, go after them. I'll look after Kariya-san. Boy: They have a girl's face, but are dressed like a boy! Boy: C'mon, which is it? Mom, which is it? Mother: I'm sorry. Tsumugi: It's okay. Ahaha... *sigh* Tsumugi: Hoshina-kun? Aww... Did you see that? Shuuji: Hm? S-See what? Tsumugi: Huh? No, it's fine. Really. Shuuji: No, I insist. You're a girl, after all. Tsumugi: ...You did see that, didn't you? Shuuji: Ugh... Tsumugi: But, the way you always treat me like a girl d-does make me happy, I guess. Shuuji: Phew, I thought you were gonna call me a playboy again or something. Tsumugi: Hehe, are you finally acknowledging it? Shuuji: Oh, come on. I'd actually need to be popular first. Shuuji: Oh... I was probably worrying over nothing, but... Shuuji: I thought that you might find it hard to come to the OC tomorrow. Tsumugi: Huh? Shuuji: 'Cause you seem the most worried about what Akagi did out of all of us. Tsumugi: She just comes to these conclusions from her more animalistic instincts. Tsumugi: So sometimes she gets the wrong idea and goes a bit crazy... But she's not a bad girl. Tsumugi: Yeah. She may look human, but alps really are different from us. Tsumugi: I was really shocked by how mature Souma-san looks. Shuuji: I had the advantage of meeting her first. Shuuji: H-Hey, Shiiba-san, you're not― Tsumugi: Don't worry, I'll still come to school and to the OC. Tsumugi: I can tell I'm going to worry you half to death if I don't. Shuuji: Geez, don't scare me like that. Tsumugi: But... I do have to give Akagi a stern talking to as well. Tsumugi: Yeah, of course. Where's this coming from? Shuuji: I was just thinking about how much you care for Akagi. Tsumugi: That's not just because she's going to grant my wish, you know? Shuuji: Yeah, I know. Shuuji: I gotta admit, I'm curious to know what kind of wish you want granted badly enough to go through this. Tsumugi: Hmmm... Tsumugi: It's not that I don't trust you, Hoshina-kun. Tsumugi: But if I tell you, you're definitely gonna laugh at me. So I don't wanna. Shuuji: What? I won't, I swear! Tsumugi: You liar. You're always saying that and then making fun of me anyway. Shuuji: No, I... I do actually, don't I? Shuuji: But it's a wish you want badly enough to make yourself dress up as a guy, right? Tsumugi: Really? Do you know how much trouble it is for me to only be able to dress up in boys' clothes? Tsumugi: I don't think you do, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Hmm, I think you look pretty good, anyway. Tsumugi: That's not the issue here. Tsumugi: Would you like it if you suddenly had to go to school in a girls' uniform? Shuuji: I'd rather die! Shuuji: But that's just how horrible it would be! Shuuji: I get your point, though. The way everyone would go on about how cute I look in girls' clothes would make me wanna die. Tsumugi: I don't want to die, but you understand now, right? Shuuji: Yeah. I'm sorry about everything before. Tsumugi: I never thought you'd show so much remorse, though. Shuuji: Look, I know this doesn't make up for it, but I'll tell you my secret. Tsumugi: Oh yeah, you were trying to explain that. Shuuji: The thing is, Akagi isn't the first one to mistake me for a witch. Shuuji: Apparently, Ayachi-san thought the same thing at first. Tsumugi: She did? Shuuji: Nah, that would be telepathy. Shuuji: My ability's closer to empathy. Tsumugi: ...You're surprisingly untactful, given that ability. Shuuji: Hmm, well speaking from experience, being able to read the mood and knowing how to behave are different things. Shuuji: To be honest with you, that previously made me want to distance myself from other people as much as possible. Tsumugi: ...Huh? Shuuji: I was pretty good at making it at least look like everything was fine. Shuuji: Though, I guess people told me I had eyes like a dead fish pretty often. Tsumugi: Really? You've never seemed like that to me. Shuuji: Yeah. I changed after joining the OC. Shuuji: I was taking life more seriously by the time I met you. Shuuji: So the reason I come across as such a moron is that I'm not really used to interacting with people. Tsumugi: You've been suffering this whole time without telling anyone about it? Shuuji: Don't you find it creepy? I've been reading your emotions this whole time. Tsumugi: It's not like you ever did anything bad with that power, and I am a witch and all. Tsumugi: So if anything, I've probably been the one lacking tact here... No, I know I have. Tsumugi: The wish that made me become a witch. Shuuji: You sure? Tsumugi: It's really not that big of a deal. It's sorta embarrassing how much I've been hiding it, actually. Tsumugi: But, if possible, could you not laugh? Shuuji: I won't. Tsumugi: I used to be really obsessed with dressing up cute and girly. Tsumugi: There was... this one set of clothes I really wanted. Shuuji: ...You didn't wish for money to buy clothes or something, did you? Tsumugi: No, I got a part time job. Shuuji: ...You what. Tsumugi: And so I made my wish... To have one more set of those clothes back on store shelves. Shuuji: So, uh... That's why you have to dress up as a guy? Shuuji: This is far too cruel! Tsumugi: I-I know! I suppose that normally it would have been a smaller cost. Tsumugi: But typically your wish isn't granted until you've collected all the heart fragments. Tsumugi: But I was so, so, so desperate back then. Tsumugi: That Akagi loaned me her magic in advance. Shuuji: Wait, does that mean... Shuuji: You already have those clothes, and the high price is just the interest on that loan? Tsumugi: Y-Y-Yeah, more or less. Shuuji: ...... Tsumugi: ...... Shuuji: ............ Tsumugi: ............ Shuuji: ...Pfft! Shuuji: Ahaha, ahahahaha! What the hell? Ahahahahahahaha! Tsumugi: Hey! You ARE laughing! Shuuji: I-I mean, I never thought... it would be something so pointless. Ahahahaha! Shuuji: Like, she loaned you her magic, and the interest on that loan is forcing you to dress as a guy? Shuuji: That means you haven't even been able to wear them yet, right? Tsumugi: W-Well yeah, but... Geez! Sheesh! You said you wouldn't laugh! "

Student Council president? Hideaki: Me? What, are you serious? Do you think I'd make a good prez? Shuuji: No. Absolutely not. Hideaki: Dude, that's messed up. You're the one who suggested it. Wakana: Where'd this come from, anyway? You've never been interested in the Student Council before. Hideaki: This Student Council crap fits you just as well as it fits me. Shuuji: Yeah, tell me about it. I wouldn't ever want to be president myself. I could do without that much stress. Wakana: Yeah. \"Looking for students willing to become Student Council president!\" right? Hideaki: Ahh... That's what that flier said? Wakana: You didn't even take one? Hideaki: I try to never take random crap like fliers and tissues. Wakana: Except it was the Student Council handing them out. Why wouldn't you take one? Hideaki: Well, I mean... If it was something really important, we'd get a handout in class and not some flier. Wakana: Yeah, I guess. Hideaki: Do you have that flier still? Wakana: I threw it away after getting it the day before yesterday. Wakana: Ah, but... Hey, Shiiba-saaan! Tsumugi: ...Huh? M-Me? Wakana: Yup. Come over here. Wakana: That's the flier the Student Council was handing out, right? Let us see it before you throw it away. Tsumugi: This? Oh, sure. Here. Hideaki: So this is the flier, huh? Hmm... They must be in deep shit if they're still handing out fliers for that. Wakana: You think so? Shuuji: Morning, Shiiba-san. Tsumugi: Ah, good morning, Hoshina-kun. Tsumugi: Umm, is this about yesterday, maybe? Shuuji: Yeah. I asked if they'd be up for it, and it's looking like a big fat \"no.\" Tsumugi: Are you and Kariya-san close? Shuuji: I guess. She's one of my few friends. Tsumugi: Then... the reason she talked to me yesterday was...? Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: The guy next to Kariya is Kaidou Hideaki. He's another friend of mine. Hideaki: Huh? Me? Shuuji: C'mon. You're her classmate, so introduce yourself to her. Hideaki: Uh, sure... I'm Kaidou Hideaki. I know I'm a guy, but feel free to come to me if there's anything you need help with. Tsumugi: Ah, okay. Thanks! Tsumugi: I'm Shiiba Tsumugi. As you can see, I'm a... well, maybe you can't see, but I'm a normal girl. Hideaki: Ahaha! What are you saying? With a rack like that, anyone would see you as a smoking hot girl. Tsumugi: ―――! Hideaki: Thank you very much! Hideaki: Wait, what the hell was that for?! That hurt! Wakana: Shut up, dumbass. Wakana: There's no way talking about her boobs like that isn't offensive. Consider yourself lucky that all I did was kick you. Shuuji: Yeah, she said it. You're a serious scumbag, dude. Tsumugi: ...You stared at them too. Didn't you? At my... b-breasts... Shuuji: Oh, gee, I don't know what you're talking about... Hideaki: You're the real scumbag for pretending like you're any better. Wakana: Here comes your punishment! Shuuji: Ouch! That hurts way more than I imagined! Wakana: Well, I can see why you guys would. Wakana: I mean, I'm so jealous... We're almost the same height, so why is there such a big difference? Ugh... Is it okay if I cry for a moment? Hideaki: Hey, some people like 'em small, you know? There's nothing wrong with a grown woman having a flat chest. Wakana: Don't call me \"flat.\" I'll knock you on your ass. Shuuji: I wouldn't worry about it. Any guy who would judge you on breast size alone isn't worth crap. Wakana: Hoshina... Hideaki: Alright, question time! Shuuji-kun, my friend, if you were forced to choose between flat or not flat, what would you choose? Shuuji: Well, it's better have than have not. Wakana: You backstabbing scumbags are the absolute worst! Hideaki: Whoa! W-Wakana-chan is seriously pissed! Shuuji: Calm down! Calm down!! Tsumugi: Pfft. Ahahaha! Wakana: This isn't funny, okay?! Tsumugi: Hah... I'm sorry, but your conversation was too funny. And, Hoshina-kun, you're a lot more fun than you let on in the clubroom. Shuuji: ...Huh? I am? Hideaki: Ah, yeah, I've been thinking so too. Shuuji: Really? Wakana: Maybe because you joined the club? It's like it really took your edge off. Shuuji: You think? Hideaki: His personality is mostly the same, but he's more approachable now. Wakana: And it's like he has lightened up a little. Hideaki: Oh, I know what you mean. He always used to look ridiculously bored and gloomy. Wakana: Yeah. How do I put it... He was like a dead fish? Shuuji: Even you guys are saying that?! Shuuji: Thank you, Shiiba-san. Shuuji: But anyway... Have I really changed that much? Hideaki: Well, you never looked out for others much before. Wakana: Right. It's really not like you to worry about Shiiba-san or to get concerned about the Student Council. Shuuji: That's just because I joined the OC and― Wakana: Look, the fact that you're sticking with such a time-consuming club is proof that you've changed. Shuuji: ...You think so? Shuuji: Yeah. She's trying to find someone willing to run for president. Tsumugi: She came to the Occult Club yesterday to ask for our help. Wakana: Hm? Did you join the club too, Shiiba-san? Tsumugi: Just as a trial for now, but yeah. Tsumugi: So please don't hesitate to come over and talk to us if there's anything you're troubled with. Wakana: I already got help for a problem of mine. But I'll be sure to stop by again should anything come up. Tsumugi: Yeah! Any time. Hideaki: Dude, you've really got a harem going, huh? Shuuji: Being the only guy in a club full of girls is a lot more awkward than you think. Hideaki: Is that so? It seems pretty good to me. Shuuji: It can feel pretty isolating, being the only guy there... Hideaki: ...Yeah, that does sound kinda scary. Tsumugi: Kariya-san, do you happen to know anyone willing to run for president? Wakana: No, unfortunately not. Sorry. Hideaki: Same here. Well, there is someone I think would be a good fit. Tsumugi: Huh? Who? Hideaki: Who else? Wakana, Hideaki: Ayachi-san. Wakana: I wouldn't have any problem with her being president. I think she'd make for a good leader. Hideaki: Yeah, and everyone loves her. She'd win the election, easy. There's no one better for the job than her. Tsumugi: But, unfortunately, she already turned down the offer yesterday. Wakana: I see... That's too bad. Hideaki: Well, I guess she has the club to worry about. Hideaki: Is there no one else you could ask? Shuuji: I don't have anyone other than you guys! Hideaki: Dude, that's sad. Don't say that so proudly. Shuuji: ...... Akita: Huh? Hmm... Nah. Sounds like a lot of work. Shuuji: But I bet it'd be a real hit at the mixers. \"I'm the Student Council president at my school.\" \"Wow, that's incredible!\" Akita: True. It'd be a pretty effective weapon. Akita: Anyway, it's too much work for me. I wouldn't want to abandon my precious friends. Shuuji: I guess mixers are more important, huh? Akita: Hey, I said I don't go to mixers. I'm just meeting new friends, okay? Shuuji: Well, that figures... Shuuji: Yeah, sure thing. Shuuji: I couldn't find anyone. I didn't have a lot of people I could ask. Meguru: Neither could I. Like I suspected, none of the first years are willing to become president. Tsumugi: I didn't have anyone I could ask, so I checked out the Student Council's advertising efforts and decided to help them out with that. Shuuji: Oh, so that's why you had that flier. Nene: How did it go? Tsumugi: The reaction of people who accepted the fliers wasn't very good. Tsumugi: Most people really aren't interested in this kind of stuff, are they? Meguru: How'd it go for you, Nene-senpai? Nene: Not good. It seems most people see it as something that would take up all of their free time. Shuuji: Yeah. It sounds like being in the Student Council would be a real pain. Meguru: In that case... Maybe we should fix up the Student Council's image? Shuuji: You mean, like, telling everyone that being on the council isn't as hard as it seems? Tsumugi: I don't think that's a good idea. I'm sure it's not very easy. Nene: I agree. It would be a big problem for the Student Council if the president quit because the job was harder than they expected. Shuuji: Hey, Inaba-san. What are you doing, anyway? Meguru: Can't you see? I'm trying to make Shiiba-senpai look cuter with some hair accessories. Tsumugi: ...Should we stop? Shuuji: No. I think they look great on you. Tsumugi: Yeah? Thanks... Ehehe. Meguru: Can you take the barrette? Tsumugi: Y-Yeah. I'm still fine. Meguru: Then let's try this scrunchie on next. "

Having you around makes things a lot easier for me. I'd love to have you stay. Wakana: I'd love to stay too. There are a lot of other things I'd like to get... And besides, working here is pretty fun! Wakana: Can I take you up on that offer? Nanao: I'm the one asking for you here. I look forward to working with you more. Wakana: Thank you! Wakana: ...Huh? Shuuji: Ah?! Nanao: Those are heart fragments. But since it was happiness, the amount retrieved from Kariya-san was minimal. Nanao: She's okay. She's unconsciousness, but she ought to wake up in a few minutes. And she'll be right back to normal when she does. Shuuji: That's a relief, but man... that startled me. I mean, Ayachi-san just suddenly had a gun in her hand. I didn't know what to think when she shot Kariya. Nene: I'm sorry. But that is how I retrieve fragments. Nene: I shatter the enlarged part of the heart with a gunshot, and then the excess fragments are absorbed into that bottle. Nanao: This is magic. Shuuji: Feels pretty physical for magic... Shuuji: What about that outfit, then? Nene: D-Don't get the wrong idea! I'm not wearing this because I want to! Nene: And, umm... please don't look at me too much. It's really embarrassing... Shuuji: O-Oh, right. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to stare... Nanao: Allow me to explain. Nanao: That gun is known as a magic weapon, and it comes together with that outfit... They're the uniform and equipment of the witch. Shuuji: Is their magical nature also why Kariya couldn't see her? Nanao: Yes. To put it simply, her uniform renders her invisible to anyone who doesn't possess magic. Nanao: But it's just an optical effect. Others can still hear you. And they can sometimes see you if they touch you or intently focus on your location. Shuuji: Why is it that I can see her? Because my attention was on her from the start? Nanao: No. I'd suppose it's because you have magic in you. Witches can perceive one another. Nene: It's so half-baked. This wouldn't be so embarrassing if it always made me invisible to everyone. Shuuji: I guess the bottom line is that I need to watch out when you shoot your gun or transform into that outfit. Nene: Yes. So, umm... I would appreciate it if you could help me at those times. Shuuji: Got it. Just tell me whatever I need to do to help. Nene: Thank you. Shuuji: By the way, how many students are you helping right now? Nene: Just Inaba-san. Nanao: Oh, did you get someone new asking for help? Nene: Yes. She visited us before we came here today. She wants us to teach her how to become popular in her class. Nanao: Popular? That's a pretty annoying request. There's no surefire way to accomplish that. Nene: That's right... Nanao: And to think she's coming to you for that. You don't even have any friends. Nene: Oh, be quiet. Leave me alone. Nanao: So what about you, Hoshina-kun? Shuuji: I'm of no help, either. I don't have many friends. I mean, I've been avoiding getting close to anyone up until now... Nanao: Yeah, your circumstances are rather special... So, that means she's asking you two something you have absolutely no clue about. Shuuji: What about you? Do you know how to become popular? Or at least liked? Nanao: Can't you just get strong and become the boss of your territory? Shuuji: ...What? Nene: Don't bother asking Nanao. She's a cat. Shuuji: But, err... Nanao: Nene is right. I don't understand humans very well. Nanao: I can turn into one, but that's just my physical appearance. How I am on the inside is a different story. Nanao: That's also why we alps gather mana from witches. Shuuji: So, you're not interested in the magical energy, but the emotions themselves? Nanao: You got it. By learning human emotions through mana, we alps wish to become human not only on the outside, but on the inside as well. Shuuji: Oh yeah? Nanao: But since I'm not a real human, these matters are much more difficult for me to understand than it is for you. I'm unlikely to be of much help to you. Sorry. Shuuji: Oh, no. It's alright. I'll try to think of something myself. Nene: It's a lot easier when there's a problem with a clear-cut answer. Nanao: That aside, Nene. Shouldn't you return to your normal form? Kariya-san should be waking up any time now. Nene: ...Huh? Ah～～～～! Nene: P-Please don't look! Wakana: Boy, that was a surprise. To think I'd suddenly conk out... Maybe it's anemia? Shuuji: Or maybe it's some pent-up exhaustion? Wakana: Hmm... I don't think so. Maybe my excitement from finally getting paid sent too much blood to my head. Shuuji: Sounds plausible. Shuuji: So, are you alright now? Really? Wakana: Yup. I'm all good! I feel as fit as a fiddle after that nap! Shuuji: That's good to hear. Nene: ...... Wakana: I'm sorry I startled you, Ayachi-san. Nene: I-It's okay. I'm just glad you're fine. You don't have to worry about me. Wakana: Okay, my place is in that direction. Shuuji: Oh, want me to see you home? Wakana: No need! Besides, don't you live in the opposite direction? You should go home before it gets any later. Wakana: Actually, it's Ayachi-san you should see home! You're a guy, after all. Nene: Oh, I'll be okay on my own. Wakana: And I don't need anyone to see me home, either. So yeah, see you two tomorrow at school! Wakana: Alright, bye! Shuuji: Ah, and there she goes... Looks like she's doing just fine, like she said. Shuuji: ...Do you feel bad about it? Nene: ...A little. Even if there's no lasting damage, I still shot her and knocked her out... Shuuji: I guess... And it's not like you can tell her and apologize. Shuuji: But there are no after-effects, and she was as lively as can be. It's better to not overthink this. Shuuji: I don't think it's worth worrying about. Let's just head home. Shuuji: It's pretty dark out, so I'll walk you to your place. Nene: You don't have to. I'm used to being outside this late. Nene: I'll take my leave, then. See you tomorrow. Shuuji: Huh? Ah, yeah. See you tomorrow... Taichi: Oh, welcome back. Shuuji: Sorry I'm coming home late without contacting you. I'll prepare dinner right away. Taichi: I don't mind. What were you out doing? Shuuji: My club ran a little late today. Taichi: You? In a club?! What made you suddenly join one? Shuuji: You know, reasons. Taichi: Oh, I see. You fell for a girl and joined the same club as her, huh? Taichi: But, man, joining a club just to get closer to your crush is preeetty creepy, you know? Shuuji: Wrong... That's not why I joined. Taichi: It's not? Well, I guess it's good you didn't turn into a stalker... So, what kind of club is it? Shuuji: The Occult Club. Taichi: Oh... You aren't getting into some strange cult stuff, are you? Shuuji: No, I'm not. Shuuji: Basically, the club does stuff like fortune-telling and listening to people's problems and helping them out. Nothing too strange. Taichi: If you say so. But still... Helping people, huh? Kinda like your mom. Shuuji: I guess. Shuuji: Oh, speaking of, do you know a way to become popular in your class? Taichi: ...Are you okay? Are you not gelling well with your classmates? Shuuji: It's not about me. Someone came to us wanting advice on that. Taichi: Oh, I see. I was getting pretty worried that you actually had no friends. Shuuji: Do you have any general advice for that? Taichi: It's a pretty complicated issue. If we were talking about co-workers, it'd work out if you just did a good job and were helpful... Taichi: On that note, your dad does a great job and is super helpful, which is why I'm so loved and popular! Shuuji: ...I see. Okay, of course. Taichi: What's with that gentle look, Son? You'll hurt my feelings if you look at me with such warm, compassionate eyes! Shuuji: Will do. Shuuji: But, seriously... How can we help Inaba-san? "

            "Shuuji: Oh, sorry. I was just wondering how you were doing.  Nene: \"No, it's nothing like that. It's just a simple case of illness.\" Shuuji: That's good to hear... Well, I guess being sick isn't a good thing.  Shuuji: How are you holding up? Have a fever? Any coughing? Nene: \"I have a slight fever... But don't worry, it's nothing serious.\" Shuuji: Then what's the problem?  Nene: \"Well, err... yeah...\" Shuuji: Have you seen a doctor?  Nene: \"Oh no, I don't think I've actually been afflicted with anything... I just woke up feeling a little unwell this morning... So I've been in my bed resting all day.\" Shuuji: Man, that doesn't sound too good... Nene: \"Well... To be honest, I wasn't feeling too great when I went to bed last night.\" Shuuji: I think I know what's the culprit... Shuuji: You just ate too much yesterday.  Nene: \"......\" Nene: \"D-Don't say that to me... I'm already embarrassed enough as it is!\" Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: ...Pfft! Shuuji: Ahahahahahahahahahaha!! Nene: \"D-Don't laugh at me! You're so mean! I just told you I was embarrassed!\" Shuuji: Ah, sorry, I couldn't help myself. Nene: \"Nngh.\" Shuuji: Are you... mad at me? Nene: \"Absolutely. Me mad. Me big mad.\" Shuuji: I'm really sorry. Nene: \"Well... you do have a point...\" Nene: \"But I'd be too embarrassed to go see someone about this... How do I explain to them that I ate too much?\" Shuuji: I understand, but still... Nene: \"Oh, and anyways, I'm feeling a lot better now than I was this morning. I'm confident I'll feel fine in no time if I just rest up.\" Shuuji: Well, if you say so, I'll believe you. Shuuji: But anyways, I was wondering if I could, umm... maybe come visit you? Nene: \"Huh? Right now?\" Shuuji: I'm a little worried so I wanted to come check on you. Nene: \"I appreciate the sentiment... but this is a bit too sudden for me.\" Shuuji: Well, I'm not trying to stay over there or anything. I was just thinking maybe since you've been stuck in bed, there might be things you need but can't go out and get.  Shuuji: So, if you need drinks or food or whatever, I could go get stuff and bring it to you. It'd serve as a nice quick check-up, plus an apology for laughing at you earlier.  Shuuji: It'll take a while if you want me to go get anything, just as a forewarning. So, do you want me to...? Nene: \"......\" Shuuji: I'm not trying to come across as pushy or anything, so if you don't want me over right now you can just say so.  Shuuji: Any specific kind? Nene: \"Just pick any they sell at convenience stores.\" Shuuji: Just that? You sure you don't want anything to eat? Nene: \"I do... but I'm still feeling a bit nauseous.\" Shuuji: Okay. Then give me about, hrm... 20 minutes, and I'll be over there. Is that okay? Nene: \"Sure.\" Nene: \"I'm sorry for making you do this.\" Shuuji: It's no big deal. I mean, hey, I'm an OC member. When someone needs help, it's my job to help.  Nene: \"...Thank you.\" Shuuji: Alright, see you in 20 minutes. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Pheeew, god damn that was nerve-wracking... Shuuji: Alright, then! Gotta hurry so I make it back in time for afternoon classes.  Nene: Hoshina-kun's coming... Nene: O-Oh goodness! I have to clean! Ah, and I need to change clothes too! Nene: Uhh... I-I feel awful... But I have to get up and move... Clerk: Have a good day! Shuuji: Okaaay, so... Shuuji: Umm, it's me, Hoshina. I'm here.  Nene: \"Come on in.\" Shuuji: Oh, no, I was just gonna drop off the stuff and leave. I don't wanna stay and intrude on you.  Nene: I can't have you leave after all the trouble I made you go through; that would be rude. Go ahead, come in and make yourself at home.  Shuuji: O-Okay... if you say so.  Nene: Missing only a single day is nothing worth concern. And I properly notified the school too.  Shuuji: Well, it's because you're living by yourself. Having no one else to help can be a little concerning in situations like these.  Shuuji: Hisashima-sensei was planning to come check on you if I hadn't. Nene: She was? Really, there's no need to be concerned... I promise I'm fine.  Shuuji: You may be fine, but you're still sick. Your face looks a little bit pale too. Shuuji: Oh, and I guess I should apologize. I didn't want to make this into some big visit, but here you went and got ready for me and everything.  Nene: Well, I wouldn't put it like that... It's just the normal thing to do. Welcoming you in my pajamas would be rude. Shuuji: I don't really think that matters when you're sick... Shuuji: But anyway, you're going to make me feel bad, so lie back down and rest. You're still not completely recovered, right?  Nene: Oh, I'll be fine. Just a little bit of moving around isn't going to hurt me.  Nene: Thank you. Shuuji: I also got you some foods that're easy to digest. If you want to try eating feel free to help yourself.  Nene: ...... Nene: *giggle* Shuuji: Err, um... What is it? Nene: I was just thinking about how you're being so overly caring. It almost feels like you're my mother. Shuuji: Oh, sorry. Was I being kind of annoying?  Nene: No, not at all. I'm thankful that you went out of your way to come visit me.  Shuuji: Really?  Nene: Of course. If I had no desire to see you I would've just said no when you initially asked.  Nene: You can tell that I'm not lying, can't you?  Shuuji: Mhm, I guess, yeah. Nene: So, consequently, well... I'm at a bit of a loss for what to do. I have so few experiences with these situations.  Shuuji: Since you said this doesn't happen a lot, I'm going to give you the full \"being nursed\" experience. Shuuji: But just a fair warning, I'm not used to this kinda thing either. Nene: Oh no, I couldn't have you do that when you've already gone out and bought things for me. I'd feel bad making you do all that... Shuuji: C'mon, you're sick right now so you need to be in bed. Oh, and did you say you were hungry? I'll make some udon, if that's fine by you.  Nene: Huh? You don't have to do that... Besides, if you stay here too long you'll be late for afternoon classes.  Shuuji: Don't worry, I'm aware. It's a bit unfortunate, but I'll only be able to do a few quick things. I don't plan on skipping class. Nene: But... Shuuji: Please, just let me do this. I have to.  Nene: Why is that?  Shuuji: Well... Shuuji: The thing is, right... Shuuji: See... You being absent from school is pretty rare in and of itself, so it got me thinking about things.  Nene: Now that you mention it... This might be the first time I've missed a day of school at Himematsu. Shuuji: And hey, it's not like we're strangers or anything. Friends worry about each other. Shuuji: I just couldn't get my mind off you all class. It was so bad I didn't hear a single thing during class, because I was so busy asking myself if you were okay, if you might need help, and so on.  Shuuji: I guess it doesn't help that you've been on my mind a whole lot recently with things. Heck, I even see you in my dreams― Nene: You're dreaming of me...? Shuuji: ...Huh? Ah, crap...! Shuuji: NO!! They're completely normal dreams, I swear! Nene: R-Really...? Shuuji: Cross my heart hope to die. Geez... What kind of stuff were you imagining me dreaming about...? Nene: Well, you know, the kind of dreams that make you, well, you know... I believe they're called wet dreams. Nene: ...How could you make me say w-w-wet dreams?! Shuuji: How is that my fault?! Shuuji: Look, as I explained, I didn't have any \"wet dreams\" about you. They were wholly innocent.  Nene: But... If there wasn't anything sexual involved... What kind of things did I do in your dreams? Shuuji: Well, umm... Nene: Y-Yes? Shuuji: My point is, I need to do this so I can get peace of mind. So could you please let me use your kitchen, plus some vegetables if you have any? Nene: Sure, that's fine by me... Ah, wait, that's not we were talking about―  Shuuji: You're sick right now so you need to be in bed! C'mon, off you go! Nene: Ah, wait, Hoshina-kun. Nene: \"Sure, go ahead.\" Shuuji: I see you're staying in bed like a good girl. Nene: ...I'd appreciate it if you didn't treat me like a small child. Shuuji: Well, I don't know if you can call yourself a big girl after upsetting your stomach like you did yesterday.  Nene: ...... Nene: You're such a meanie. I mean it.  Shuuji: Eh, I'm not really trying to tease you or anything.  Shuuji: Oh, here's some applesauce. Should be light enough for you to eat. Just make sure to finish it before it turns brown. Nene: Thank you... Shuuji: And I also made you some apple kudzu starch gruel. This'll warm you up. Shuuji: The udon's currently cooking, so give me a few more minutes for that. I'll have it nice and soft.  Nene: Oh, okay.  Shuuji: Oh, and don't force yourself to eat any of this if you don't want to. You can just tell me if you don't want it.  Nene: No, that's fine. I'm hungry, so I'll eat everything.  Shuuji: Okay, that's good.  Nene: But I have to say, you seem like you're used to doing these things. Shuuji: Really? It's actually my first time nursing someone though. My dad has way too much energy to ever fall sick. But hmm, I do do a lot of the housework... so maybe it's that. Nene: Then in that case, maybe it isn't your own experience, but the experiences you've had of your own family looking after you when you were sick?  Shuuji: Hmm... That has happened a few times, but I don't think I'm mimicking what they did.  Taichi: How do you feel, son? A little tired? They say the best way to get rid of a cold is to give it someone else, so go ahead and give it to me.  Taichi: Your dad's thinking the best way to go about that would be a smooch; what do ya say? Wanna give your old man a kiss?  Taichi: *smooooch*! Shuuji: Oh my GOOOD, can you just go away!! I'm trying to sleep here!! "

            "Wakana: If you're just normal friends and nothing more, then you shouldn't do it. That about sums it up. Shuuji: I see. That's good to know. Wakana: Okay. It's about time for me to head home too. Shuuji: Sorry I dragged you along with me. And thanks. Wakana: You're welcome. Okay then, good luck. Shuuji: See ya. Nene: The sun is starting to set. What does Kawakami-kun's schedule say from here on? Shuuji: Nothing special. They'll eat dinner together somewhere, then he'll see her home. Meguru: And where does he plan on eating? Shuuji: He put down a somewhat fancy place. Let's see... Ah, this one. Look, it's this one in the pamphlet.  Nene: This restaurant, huh... Meguru: It looks pretty expensive. Shuuji: I don't think the prices will be that outrageous, but yeah, it doesn't seem cheap. I guess he wants to make their first date something special. Meguru: I get that, but this might be going too far... Nene: Maeda-san would get nervous and worry about the price if it's too expensive. Shuuji: Yeah, but he'll be covering the bill, won't he? Meguru: But then she'll feel like she's mooching off of him. I don't think Maeda-san would be happy with that. Shuuji: I see. Nene: Wouldn't somewhere you can relax be better? A place more fitting for students. Meguru: I know how Kawakami-kun feels, but yeah... I think she'd accept an average-tasting dinner if it means she can have a good time with him, yeah? Shuuji: Hmm... You have a point. What about ramen, then? Meguru: No. Ramen is a clear no-go. Nene: As a girl, I'm sure she'll dress up for her first date, so she would be worried about the broth spatters. Food with a strong smell is also bad for the same reason. Shuuji: Then what about... a Raizeriya? The food is good, it's cheap, and it's got a pretty casual atmosphere. Meguru: Sure, the food is good there and it's fitting for students. But going to a cheap chain restaurant on the first date...? Well, I'm sure Maeda-san would be okay with that. Nene: It might be Kawakami-kun who has a problem with that, since he planned out this date so meticulously. Shuuji: True... He's a guy, after all. He has his pride. Meguru: I guess Kawakami-kun can keep his choice as a last resort, but he should play it safe and ask her where she'd like to go first. Meguru: After all, what you feel like eating depends on your mood. Nene: I agree. Shuuji: But then he'd get the old \"Anything goes,\" swiftly followed up by \"Really? THAT place?\" once you suggest something. Meguru: That's a pretty jaded outlook on women. I don't think Maeda-san would embarrass her date like that. Nene: And wouldn't a conversation about food preferences help liven things up? Meguru: You know it, Nene-senpai! Getting to know each other more like that is a nice thing. Nene: I believe the best way would be to discuss where to go together, with Kawakami-kun's choice being presented as an option. Shuuji: While we're at it, what are your thoughts on the whole date plan itself? Meguru: Hmm... It's okay, but it does feel like he's going for a little too much. Meguru: Things like going to the movies and window shopping are good and all, but it might be a little tiring with the lack of breaks. Nene: If he wants to go see that movie, it might be a good idea to relax in a cafe afterwards. Shuuji: I see. Nene: Apart from that, how about making sure he watches Maeda-san carefully? Shuuji: What do you mean? Nene: There's a lot to watch out for, such as not walking too fast. Her feet might start hurting depending on what shoes she wears. Meguru: On that note, you're walking too fast, Senpai. That's not good. Shuuji: Whoops... I wasn't thinking about that at all. Meguru: That kind of casual kindness makes girls pretty happy. Shuuji: I'll watch out for that from now on. Shuuji: Okay. I'll put all of our advice together in a text... Something like this, I guess? Meguru: Are you done? Shuuji: Yep. I also made sure to double-check it. Nothing important was left out. Nene: Well then, what shall we do now? Go home? Meguru: Huh?! Go home?! I thought we were having dinner together, so I told my parents not to make me anything! Nene: Then I don't mind going somewhere to eat. Are you coming along, Hoshina-kun? Shuuji: I don't see why not. It would beat making something for myself at home. Meguru: Do you make your own dinners? Shuuji: Yeah. All the household tasks are my job. My mother passed away a while ago, so it's just me and my dad. Meguru: Oh. Umm... Shuuji: Don't worry, I don't mind talking about it. I actually really hate it when people get awkward about it. Meguru: O-Okay. Roger that. Shuuji: Eating out is alright on your end, Ayachi-san? Nene: Yes. I live by myself, so there won't be a problem. Meguru: You live by yourself? That's pretty cool! Nene: Really? I personally don't think it's anything that great. Shuuji: Yeah, I imagine the downsides outweigh the upsides. Shuuji: Sure, but what should we eat? Nene: I'm fine with anything. There's nothing I dislike. Shuuji: What are you in the mood for, though? Anything you've been craving? Meguru: Oh, I know! Give me a \"shi\"! Give me a \"su\"! It's \"shisu\"! Shuuji: How old are you, again? Are you my grandmother? Who says it like that these days? Meguru: Hey, I'm a lovely young maiden! My stuffed animals tell me so every night! Shuuji: ...You still talk to your stuffed animals? Meguru: Huh? Oh... I kinda talk to my stuffed animals sometimes when I'm alone. I've been trying to drop the habit, but it's hard to do so... Meguru: Is that weird? Meguru: Ugh... I figured. I want to get rid of that habit. I've been trying hard to drop it, but... old habits die hard, I guess. Shuuji: Well, I'm sure you can if you keep trying. Meguru: Right! Yeah, I'll give it my best! Shuuji: What's the problem? You don't have to stop if you don't want to. Meguru: Really? Shuuji: Just maybe don't go around advertising the fact. Shuuji: Though, I'm totally cool with it. Meguru: Thank you for saying so. Shuuji: So, should we go with Inaba-san's request, then? Nene: Umm... Can you eat \"sheaths\"? Isn't that the stuff that covers cables? I don't know of any food like that... Shuuji: Huh?! How did you get to \"sheath\"?! It's \"shisu\"! Nene: Huh? It's not sheath? Then, am I the only one who doesn't know what this \"shisu\" is? Meguru: I wouldn't say that... It's something people used to say decades ago. \"Shisu\" is basically... Meguru: Man, having to explain your joke like this is really embarrassing. Shuuji: It'll be easier to just go and show her. Let's head to a shisu place. Looks like Ayachi-san is interested enough. Nene: Oh, I see. \"Shisu\" is a transposition cipher of \"sushi.\" Now it all makes sense. Meguru: T-Transposition cipher? S-Senpai, what the heck is that? Now I feel like the stupid one. Shuuji: Huh? It's a form of encryption where characters or group of characters are shifted. Meguru: Another critical hit?! I'm the only stupid one here?! Shuuji: Ayachi-san, are you okay with sushi? Conveyor belt sushi, even. Nene: Yes, I'm okay with this. I'm looking forward to it, actually. I've never been to a sushi restaurant like this before. Meguru: Oh, really? Nene: I almost never eat out. I'm getting rather excited! Nene: Is that so? Wow, amazing... Meguru: That's a big fat lie. Stop trying to trick her into embarrassing herself, Senpai. Shuuji: I didn't actually expect her to believe me... Sorry. Nene: No, it's okay. More importantly, look at it go round and round... Ah, there's even pudding! Shuuji: Do you visit these kinds of sushi places often, Inaba-san? Meguru: Not on my own, but sometimes with my family. It's actually a lot rarer for me to go to normal sushi restaurants. What about you? Shuuji: ...Now that I think about it, I guess I hardly ever eat out either. Especially since my dad often works weekends. Though, it's not like it's my first time at a place like this. Nene: By the way, umm, what is this faucet-like thing? Meguru: Oh, well, these kinds of sushi places are self-serve, so― Shuuji: Hey, you ever hear the joke about how you're supposed to wash your hands with that faucet before eating? Nene: Is that so? That's very convenient. Meguru: Hey! Don't! You'll get burned! Stop misleading her, Senpai! You're filling this poor novice's head full of lies! Shuuji: Sorry, Ayachi-san. That was a nasty joke. That is a hot water dispenser for tea. You can find teabags inside the box there. Be careful; it's hot. Nene: Oh, so it's for tea. I would have fallen for that if you hadn't told me. Shuuji: Yeah, it is... Gotta say, you look like you're having a blast. Nene: To be honest, I've always wanted to go to a conveyor belt sushi restaurant once. I could never muster the courage to go by myself. Meguru: True, going to this kind of place alone is hard. Well, I'm glad we came here if you're enjoying it. Nene: I got a tuna! You two aren't going to take anything? Meguru: Ah, excuse me! Some flounder, please! Nene: ......? Shuuji: Ah, I'll take some sea bream and albacore roe. Clerk: Flounder, sea bream and albacore roe, alright. Thank you very much! Nene: ―――, ......, ―――, ...... Nene: Umm, Hoshina-kun, Inaba-san. Aren't you supposed to take your sushi from the conveyor belt? Meguru: Generally, yeah. But these days a lot of restaurants accept direct orders. Shuuji: Yeah, some places even have menus. Nene: ...Oh, I see. "
