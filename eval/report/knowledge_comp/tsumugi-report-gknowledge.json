But lunch break is almost over... Shuuji: It won't take long. Nene: Okay. Well then, we'll continue later. Meguru: Got it. Tsumugi: I'll head back to class now. Kanae: Mhm, nnngh... Teacher A: Hisashima-sensei, how are things going for that transfer student? Kanae: She's doing great. There aren't any problems so far. Teacher A: I see. I'm glad to hear that. Kids these days have such different values. I have no idea what they're thinking. Kanae: No matter how hard you try, you'll never be able to understand all of them, anyway. Teacher A: Yeah, I suppose so. Alright, time to go to my next class. Nene: It's weak, but the bottle is responding. It should be possible to retrieve fragments from her. Shuuji: Oh, nice. Nene: That would be a bad idea. Classes are about to start, and it would cause a scene if she suddenly collapsed in the faculty room. Shuuji: After school, then? But we need to help with the election... Nene: It's not like we need to do it right away. It should be alright to do it when we're about to go home. Shuuji: Yeah? Then let's go back to the classroom for now. Hideaki: Nnngh! Man, it's finally over. Wakana: Alright, time for my part-time job. Hideaki: Working again today, huh? What about you, Shuuji? Shuuji: Gonna help with the election stuff. Hideaki: Oh, the thing Shiiba-san's flier was about?  Wakana: Sorry. I'd help if I didn't have to work. Shuuji: Don't worry about it. Nene: Umm, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Ah, yeah. I know. Nene: It seems she left the classroom the moment school was over. Shuuji: Did she go on ahead of us? Touko: Oh, don't worry about it. Especially since you helped out this morning. Tsumugi: I'm done with that now, so I can start helping right away. Touko: Okay, thanks. Shuuji: Seems like no one's even accepting the fliers anymore. Tsumugi: Oh, I see... Shuuji: I feel like this is because everyone already knows, not because they don't care. Shuuji: A positive way to look at this would be that the advertising succeeded in spreading the word to everyone. But... Tsumugi: That doesn't do any good if no one actually wants to run for president. Shuuji: Right. I doubt this kind of simple advertising will get us any further. Shuuji: Yeah, if only that was so easy... Touko: Maybe people would look at the fliers more if we made them pink? Especially the guys. Shuuji: Togakushi-senpai... Touko: Sorry, sorry. But jokes aside, we can stop handing out fliers now. Tsumugi: Are you sure? Touko: I think just about everyone knows about the election by now, so handing out more fliers would be pretty meaningless. Touko: Besides, even if I'm retiring, I'm still the president for now and have lots of other things to do. So it's not like I'm going easy on you guys. Nene: Then... Touko: I'll wait and see how effective our advertising was and then take things from there myself. Meguru: Do you know of any good candidates other than that Koshiji-san person? Touko: I dunno... The other vice president is better suited for drafting reports, so if I was gonna persuade someone, it would probably be the secretary. Touko: Anywho, that's just another part of my job, so leave it all to me. Nene: ...Okay, we will. But please don't hesitate to let us know if there's anything else we can help with. Touko: Thank you, Ayachi-san. Nene: I'm very sorry we couldn't be of help. Touko: That's not true. Thanks to you, the rest of the council was able to keep working while we were out here spreading the word. Nene: Just let us know if there's anything else we can help with. We'll gladly do whatever we can. Touko: Okay, thank you. I'll take you up on that if we ever need the help. Touko: Alright then, let's call it a day. Tsumugi: But we already tried to come up with something during lunch break and couldn't. Meguru: Right... *sigh* Shuuji: Anyway, shouldn't we go somewhere else now? No point in standing around and talking here. Nene: We should call it a day. The sun's starting to set, after all. Meguru: Nene-senpai, can we go home together? Nene: Sorry, but I can't. There's something I need to do today. Meguru: Oh, really? That's too bad. Meguru: How about you, Shiiba-senpai? Got any plans? Tsumugi: Me? No, I don't. I was going to go straight home... You really want to walk home with me? Meguru: Of course! If you don't mind, I'd love to! Tsumugi: Of course I don't! I really want to as well. Meguru: Yay! Tsumugi: Ehehe. Meguru: Ah, what about you, Hoshina-senpai? Shuuji: Thanks for asking, but sorry. I got other plans. Meguru: Well, okay... Well, let's go, Shiiba-senpai. Where do you live? Tsumugi: Past the station. Meguru: Same as me, then! Umm... Would it be okay for me to call you Tsumugi-senpai? Tsumugi: Y-Yeah! Of course! "

Touko: Yeah, and it's not like you got it because you wanted it. Shuuji: ...But it's true that my ability is what allowed me to start dating Meguru, so I don't hate it anymore. Touko: That's good.

There's somewhere I gotta go today. Meguru: O-Okay... Meguru: A-Alright then, Senpai. Umm... See you tomorrow! Shuuji: Yeah, see you tomorrow. Meguru: ...... Shuuji: Hello. Thanks again for the help a while back. I'm wondering, can you spare another moment for me? Nanao: Hmm... Okay. I'll close the cafe. Shuuji: Huh? Nanao: You've come here looking for help with something, right? Have a seat here and wait a moment. Shuuji: ...Thank you. Shuuji: ...What do you think, Souma-san? Nanao: I figured you might come to me with those questions one day... Which is why I've given them a lot of thought myself. Shuuji: I'd really appreciate it. Nanao: A witch may be gathering other people's heart fragments, but those are just the ingredients. The magic is formed according to the contractor's own wish and feelings. Nanao: So yes, it exists to fulfill their wish. Nanao: And like I told you before, there is no doubt that the ability you possess is magical in nature. Shuuji: ...But it's not like I got this ability because I was trying to fulfill some wish. Shuuji: ...Right. Nanao: And since it's magic, it also has a purpose that goes along with it. Nanao: Both you and your mother should have different purposes. Nanao: Your magic and hers are similar, but not the same. You possess your own magic. Shuuji: Which means my ability must have some kind of purpose... Shuuji: But, still― Nanao: I have a question I'd like to ask you first. Shuuji: Ah, s-sure. Nanao: Correct me if I'm wrong, but is it possible that you've been sensing the emotions of everyone other than Meguru less lately? Shuuji: Um... Yeah. I have been. Nanao: So then... Nanao: Doesn't that mean that a degree of directionality or selectivity has developed for your ability? Nanao: Basically, it's becoming possible for you to control it. Shuuji: ...... Nanao: How you absorbed the Meguru's fragments a while back is another example. Nanao: You were present for several other occasions where fragments were collected, but that was the only time you absorbed them during the collection process. Nanao: Don't you think the reason for that lies within you? Not that you did this intentionally, of course. Shuuji: So I've become able to control my ability... Nanao: ...Your magic is an extremely unusual case. Nanao: But nonetheless, it is still magic. So what this all comes down to is... Nanao: What is it you really wish for? The answer to that question is the key to everything. Shuuji: What I wish for... Nanao: Maybe your heart is waiting for you to find the answer to that question. Nanao: Maybe you're subconsciously aware that such an answer exists. Shuuji: ...... Nanao: Have a sip of coffee. Shuuji: ...Yeah, good idea. Nanao: Glad to hear that. Nanao: ...It's said that we evolved a sense of taste in order to judge whether something is dangerous or okay to eat. Shuuji: O-Okay? Nanao: However, humans have no need for that anymore. Instead, they only use it for enjoying the taste of food. Nanao: People living in this day and age never even think about the original purpose of their taste buds anymore. Shuuji: ...... Nanao: But that purpose is clear and immutable. Nanao: You have it to protect your very life. "

She's not from our class, is she? Shuuji: Koshiji-san. Have you seen the posters posted all over the hallway? Tsumugi: The election posters, you mean? Oh, right. She's the one running for election! Tsumugi: Then, she's the girl Togakushi-senpai mentioned? Shuuji: That's right. Tsumugi: Oh, that's great! I was a little worried about how that would turn out. Tsumugi: I've been wondering if there was something else we could do, but it looks like we don't need to worry anymore. Shuuji: Yeah, I think things will work out just fine from now on. Shuuji: You're so kind, though. You just transferred and you're already that worried about our school? Tsumugi: I'm not that kind... Tsumugi: But, well, it would bug me if things ended poorly without us, since we already helped out. Shuuji: I guess... What of it? Tsumugi: Oh, nothing... She didn't want to run before, so I was just wondering what made her change her mind. Tsumugi: She didn't look reluctant, from what I could tell. Do you know anything about that? Shuuji: Hm, no idea. I guess she had a change of heart? Shuuji: She looked pretty happy, so I'm sure it was a change for the better. I don't think we need to worry about it. Tsumugi: ...Yeah. You're right. It must've been a positive change. Shuuji: ...... Tsumugi: Well then, let's head back to class! Shuuji: What about the drinks you came here for? Tsumugi: Oh, that's right! They would've been so mad if I forgot! Shuuji: Here, I'll help you carry them. Tsumugi: Thanks! Koshiji: Well, things are about to get real busy for me. But I made my decision; I'm not about to back out now. Koshiji: Let's do this! Nene: The bottle's reacting. Shuuji: Think you can retrieve some fragments, then? Nene: Yes. It's a very strong response, so I'm sure we'll be able to retrieve a lot of fragments. Shuuji: Oh, well... Things happened. Shuuji: I'd really appreciate it if you didn't ask for the details, actually. Nene: Oh, well, okay. But can you answer just one question? There's something I've been wondering about. Nene: Was Koshiji-san who you were talking about yesterday? Shuuji: H-Hmm... Nene: Oh, sorry, I'm not meaning to pry. There's just something I noticed... Nene: About the fragments I've gathered... The bottle seems a little more full today than it was yesterday. Shuuji: And you haven't retrieved any fragments from anyone? Nene: Right. It's not a very big change so it may just be my imagination, but... something is telling me that it's not. Shuuji: Can the fragment count really go up on its own like that? Nene: Not normally, no. But after thinking about it, I found one possible cause... You. Shuuji: M-Me?! Nene: Or more accurately, the fragments you took from me. Don't you think it's possible that something caused some of them to return? Nene: So, I would like you to tell me; did something happen yesterday? Something out of the ordinary. Shuuji: H-Hard to say... Shuuji: A lot happened yesterday. I helped Koshiji-san come to terms with an issue that has been plaguing her for a very long time. Shuuji: She thanked me, which made me strangely happy... Maybe that's why. Nene: Oh, I see. Shuuji: Yeah. I'm really happy I joined the OC. Nene: ...I'm glad you feel that way. Shuuji: Oh, could you wait on that? Nene: Is there a problem with that? Shuuji: No, not exactly... But why not wait a little longer? Nene: Huh? What's the point in waiting? Shuuji: The other witch might show up. Nene: Sure, she might... But that seems like a long shot. Nene: Even if there is another witch, she would have to notice Koshiji-san's change. Shuuji: Yeah, but you never know. Nene: If you wish. Koshiji: That should be the last notice. Nnngh... Alright, let's head back. Shuuji: Right... Nene: Do you think this means they really haven't noticed? I could have also been reading too much into the whole second witch thing. Shuuji: Hmm... Nene: Are you sure? We could always do this another day. Shuuji: Nah, it's better to do it now. Shuuji: There are a lot of fragments at stake here. Who knows what could happen if we wait around too much. Shuuji: And this isn't just about the fragment count; it's not good for Koshiji-san's heart, is it? So you should just do it now. Nene: ...You're right. Okay then. Shuuji: S-Sorry... Nene: I'm going to get this over with quickly so I can change back into my school uniform ASAP. Shuuji: O-Okay. Nene: No way. There really is... Nene: Most likely... B-But can you believe this nonsense? Nene: Her outfit is not just tactful, but really cute too! I mean, look at what I have to wear! It's not fair! Shuuji: Is this really the time and place for that?! Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Crap! She's running away! Shuuji: W-Wait up! Shuuji: I can't just leave things like this! Shuuji: Besides, if my guess is right, we'll be able to talk it out! Nene: Wh-What guess? ? ? ?: Huh?! Whoa, hey! Shuuji: Whoa?! Shuuji: Mmrrphl... Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: ... Shuuji: ―――?!?! Shuuji: Mrr, mmmrph! ? ? ?: ...Huh? \"Mmmrph\"? Shuuji: ...... ? ? ?: ...... ? ? ?: Hey! Wh-What are you doing?! Shuuji: Mmmrph?! ? ? ?: Hyaaaah! ? ? ?: Ahh! Hey! Don't talk! It tickles! Ah, hyahh! Shuuji: ――― ? ? ?: D-Don't move, either! Just get away from me! Tsumugi: Ayachi-san, that witch just now was... you? Nene: So... you're a witch too? Tsumugi: ......Yeah. Shuuji: ...... Tsumugi: Nnnhyaah?! Tsumugi: Don't be. I mean... It's not your fault. I was the one who ran away. Tsumugi: O-Okay... Nene: And that's why you wanted to join, right? Tsumugi: ...Yeah. Nene: I see... Nene: Hoshina-kun, how did you notice that Shiiba-san is a witch? Tsumugi: Huh?! Y-You noticed?! Shuuji: Well, it's not like I knew for sure. I just had a vague idea, based on some circumstantial evidence. Nene: I see. The witch didn't have to be new. They could've been an existing witch who recently arrived. Shuuji: Since Hisashima-sensei is Shiiba-san's homeroom teacher and handled her transfer paperwork, they must've been in close contact with each other. Shuuji: But more importantly, there's something all witches share―a contract to fulfill their wish. Shuuji: And that contract comes with a price the witch must pay, right?  Nene: I see... With Shiiba-san, you think that's the way she has to dress? Shuuji: That's right. I figured that there had to be a very special reason for her being unable to wear girly clothing. Nene: And that reason is the price in her witch contract... Tsumugi: ...Yeah, you're right. Shuuji: You have it rough too, huh? Tsumugi: Seriously, why did I have to become this way... Ugh. I know, I only have myself to blame for this. Tsumugi: But anyway, I never would have guessed that you were a witch too... Nene: Yeah, this is very surprising. Tsumugi: ...Your outfit is pretty wild, huh? That's just as surprising. Nene: D-Don't misunderstand! It's not like I want I want to dress like this! Tsumugi: Yeah, I know. You can't choose your magic weapon and clothes. Nene: Argh... This is so incredibly unfair. I have to wear this nonsense while you get such a cute outfit... Nene: I wish I had an outfit like yours! Tsumugi: D-Don't tell that to me... Shuuji: Why don't you two transform back into your regular outfits before continuing? Tsumugi: Y-Yeah. Good idea, I guess... Shuuji: ...? What's wrong? Is there a problem with that? Tsumugi: No, there isn't. But, well, you know how I normally have to dress... Tsumugi: The only time I get to wear cute clothes is when I'm transformed. Shuuji: Oh yeah... You're wearing a skirt, no problem. Tsumugi: The only time I can wear cute clothes and not get sick is when I'm in my witch outfit. So, it's a little embarrassing, but it also makes me happy. Tsumugi: It's really soothing, you know? Ehehe! Nene: ...How unfair. It's so... so so so so so so unfair. Shuuji: Okay, that's enough. You're seriously freaking me out right now. Tsumugi: So, Hoshina-kun, why have you been helping Ayachi-san? Shuuji: Well, err... A lot happened. Nene: A series of events led him to finding out I'm a witch. He's been helping me out ever since. Tsumugi: Oh, yeah? Shuuji: So, what's your story? Let me guess, you had to transfer to our school because of some kind of witch-related issue? Tsumugi: Ah, no, nothing like that. I just moved here because my dad got a new job. Nene: Yeah, I expected as much. Unless there are some very special circumstances, moving only gets in the way of fragment gathering. Tsumugi: Yeah, tell me about it. I was so worried about how I'd gather fragments after finding out we were moving... Especially since I didn't know anyone here. Tsumugi: But I made new friends so quickly, and I even found a club about helping people, so... I couldn't help myself... Shuuji: Yeah, I don't blame you at all for using our club like that. Shuuji: Oh, yeah. Sorry, I basically tricked you. Shuuji: I figured that if you really were our witch, you'd maybe try to retrieve Koshiji-san's fragments. You just happened to walk in on our conversation at a good time for that. Tsumugi: Oh. I really fell for that one, didn't I? Tsumugi: Umm, I'm so sorry, Ayachi-san! I didn't mean to get in your way... Nene: Oh, no. Please don't worry about it. You didn't know, so I don't blame you for anything. Nene: Considering how rare we are, it's hard to imagine there being two witches in such a small area. I certainly didn't. Tsumugi: ...Yeah, you're right. Nene: So then, about how to proceed from here... Tsumugi: U-Umm! I don't want any trouble. And I definitely don't want to fight or race for the fragments. Tsumugi: So I won't get in the way of your fragment gathering. You've been here for much longer than I have, after all. Tsumugi: So, umm... Is it okay for me to stay in the club? Nene: That's just fine. I don't want to fight, either. I'd really like it if we could stay the same as before. Tsumugi: Th-Thank you so much! Ah, I'm so glad... I was so worried you might say no. Shuuji: ...Oh, is that why you tried to run from us? Shuuji: I'm guessing that you never planned on getting in our way; that you just happened to attempt retrieving the fragments at the same time as us, yeah? Tsumugi: Yeah, you're spot on. I thought that if I escaped, I could avoid retrieving fragments at school from now on, and just maybe stay friends with you two. Nene: Umm, about that. How about we work together instead? Tsumugi: Huh? What do you mean by that? Nene: You said you'd concede all the fragments to me, but I don't really see our school as my territory or anything. Nene: So, would you like to gather fragments together with me? Tsumugi: But I'd feel bad about that. I mean, I wouldn't want to leech off you after what I did. Nene: But it'd be a problem if you stopped gathering fragments, wouldn't it? Tsumugi: Well, yeah... That's true, but... Nene: Please don't worry about it. You would do the same if you were in my position. Besides... Nene: I can understand how you feel. I know full well how hard it can be to live with the contract's price. Shuuji: ...Yeah, you really don't have it easy with your contract. Nene: Don't remind me... Just thinking about it makes me sick. I still don't want to believe it's real. God... This sucks. Tsumugi: Actually, what is the price that you're paying? Nene: ―――! Tsumugi: Oh, um, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked that, should I? Sorry for being insensitive. Nene: O-Oh, no... I'm the one who suggested we work together, so I shouldn't keep any secrets. We should be able to trust each other... Nene: The truth is, umm, my price is...... H... Horn... Horniness. Tsumugi: Huh? A h-horny... what? Sorry, but what did you just say? Nene: Horniness... It's horniness! Tsumugi: \"Horniness\"? Horniness... Wait, horniness?! What?! Did you really just say \"horniness\"?! Nene: ...... Shuuji: Because of it, Ayachi-san, umm, how should I put this... She gets random bouts of arousal against her will. Shuuji: That also happens to be how I learned about her being a witch. Tsumugi: I-I see... That sounds like a much tougher price than mine... Nene: I don't mean to boast or argue who has it worse, but... it really is horrible. Why did it have to be this...? Tsumugi: I have the same thought sometimes... Why do our prices have to be so brutal? "

            "Tsumugi: So maybe Hoshina-kun's subconscious is reluctant to let go of them. That might be why I'm not getting any back. Meguru: Yeah... Sorry for kinda making you comfort me... Nene: Whatever the case, try not to feel so useless. Nene: There's no doubt all the fragments we've gotten back so far are thanks to the, umm... p-power of your love. Meguru: Ah... Nene-senpaaai! Touko: Lost in thought, huh? Shuuji: Ah... Hey there, Togakushi-senpai. Touko: Can't bear to face Inaba-san? Shuuji: No, that's not it... Touko: Alrighty. Well then, let your big sis here lend you an ear. Touko: Talking to someone might help you sort out your thoughts, no matter who it is. Shuuji: ...Thank you. Touko: It makes sense that you'd be worried about the hole in your heart, given that you were born with that magic of yours. Shuuji: Right... I mean, I still don't really understand much about it. Touko: Yeah, and it's not like you got it because you wanted it. Shuuji: ...But it's true that my ability is what allowed me to start dating Meguru, so I don't hate it anymore. Touko: That's good. There's no point in hating it, so that's for the best. Shuuji: Right. I realize that my ability is a part of who I am, and Meguru loves me along with it. Touko: Ohh, what an awesome thing to say. You looked really cool there. Shuuji: Thank you... But, how do I put it... Touko: Hm? Shuuji: Meguru seems desperate to fill the hole in my heart... which only makes me feel worse about the situation. Touko: Say, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Yeah...? Touko: Magic is granted to people with wishes they want fulfilled, yeah? Shuuji: That's what I've heard. I don't know what Ayachi-san and Shiiba-san's wishes are, though. Touko: I see. But... Touko: ...What about your magic? Shuuji: Huh? Touko: Well, you have magic too, right? Shuuji: Yeah, but I just inherited it from my mom. Touko: But from what I've heard, your magic is similar but different. Shuuji: Well... Yeah... Touko: So I'm wondering why you have it. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: ...... Touko: Hm? Shuuji: Thank you. Touko: Don't thank me. I was just thinking aloud a little. Shuuji: Still. Shuuji: Meguru, sorry! Meguru: What?! Meguru: Umm, what is it...? Shuuji: I have to go now. There's somewhere I gotta go today. Meguru: O-Okay... Meguru: A-Alright then, Senpai. Umm... See you tomorrow! Shuuji: Yeah, see you tomorrow. Meguru: ...... Shuuji: Hello. Thanks again for the help a while back. I'm wondering, can you spare another moment for me? Nanao: Hmm... Okay. I'll close the cafe. Shuuji: Huh? Nanao: You've come here looking for help with something, right? Have a seat here and wait a moment. Shuuji: ...Thank you. Shuuji: ...What do you think, Souma-san? Nanao: I figured you might come to me with those questions one day... Which is why I've given them a lot of thought myself. Shuuji: I'd really appreciate it. Nanao: A witch may be gathering other people's heart fragments, but those are just the ingredients. The magic is formed according to the contractor's own wish and feelings. Nanao: So yes, it exists to fulfill their wish. Nanao: And like I told you before, there is no doubt that the ability you possess is magical in nature. Shuuji: ...But it's not like I got this ability because I was trying to fulfill some wish. Shuuji: ...Right. Nanao: And since it's magic, it also has a purpose that goes along with it. Nanao: Both you and your mother should have different purposes. Nanao: Your magic and hers are similar, but not the same. You possess your own magic. Shuuji: Which means my ability must have some kind of purpose... Shuuji: But, still― Nanao: I have a question I'd like to ask you first. Shuuji: Ah, s-sure. Nanao: Correct me if I'm wrong, but is it possible that you've been sensing the emotions of everyone other than Meguru less lately? Shuuji: Um... Yeah. I have been. Nanao: So then... Nanao: Doesn't that mean that a degree of directionality or selectivity has developed for your ability? Nanao: Basically, it's becoming possible for you to control it. Shuuji: ...... Nanao: How you absorbed the Meguru's fragments a while back is another example. Nanao: You were present for several other occasions where fragments were collected, but that was the only time you absorbed them during the collection process. Nanao: Don't you think the reason for that lies within you? Not that you did this intentionally, of course. Shuuji: So I've become able to control my ability... Nanao: ...Your magic is an extremely unusual case. Nanao: But nonetheless, it is still magic. So what this all comes down to is... Nanao: What is it you really wish for? The answer to that question is the key to everything. Shuuji: What I wish for... Nanao: Maybe your heart is waiting for you to find the answer to that question. Nanao: Maybe you're subconsciously aware that such an answer exists. Shuuji: ...... Nanao: Have a sip of coffee. Shuuji: ...Yeah, good idea. Nanao: Glad to hear that. Nanao: ...It's said that we evolved a sense of taste in order to judge whether something is dangerous or okay to eat. Shuuji: O-Okay? Nanao: However, humans have no need for that anymore. Instead, they only use it for enjoying the taste of food. Nanao: People living in this day and age never even think about the original purpose of their taste buds anymore. Shuuji: ...... Nanao: But that purpose is clear and immutable. Nanao: You have it to protect your very life. "

Nene: But I don't think the two of us can keep up with those two. Tsumugi: Yeah, no kidding. Hoshina-kun and Meguru-chan are both super good at picking up on everyone's worries and feelings. Nene: Yes. It's unbelievable when you think about how they were just a year ago. Shuuji: Were we really that dense in your eyes? Meguru: You had your ability, so I wouldn't say you were outright dense. I think she's talking about how you were kinda out of touch with some things? Meguru: Right, Nene-senpai? It's hard to believe how this guy used to be, huh? Tsumugi: Err, you know you're in the same boat, right? Meguru: No way! You were talking about me too?! I thought I was really good at picking up on things! Nene: In your case, you were either too considerate or not at all. You were either on or off, with nothing in the middle. Meguru: Ugh... Y-Yeah, that sounds about right... Now I'm depressed. Tsumugi: B-But that's not the case anymore, so don't worry about it! You two are now the stars of the club! Tsumugi: How did you two become so good at this, anyway? Meguru: Well... I dunno. How did we? I just sorta became able to pick up on things better... Shuuji: Well, Meguru and I were both really bad at socializing in general. Shuuji: But now that I have Meguru, I can look back on my past self more objectively... That's probably helping a lot. Nene: I see. Maybe you're right. Tsumugi: Oh, so it's thanks to your relationship with Meguru-chan? Meguru: Senpai... Shuuji: Hahaha. Well, maybe that's just how I want to see it. Meguru: No, I think so too! I also wanna see that way too! Meguru: Nene-senpai, Tsumugi-senpaai! Hoshina-senpai loves me as much as ever♪ Nene: Mmph. I-I can't breathe, Inaba-san... Tsumugi: Ahaha, at least that hasn't changed about her... Except for the added boyfriend brag. Shuuji: Yeah, that's my Meguru, alright. Tsumugi: Right. \"Your\" Meguru-chan. Shuuji: Well, it just seemed like the right thing to say here. Tsumugi: Right, right. Togakushi-senpai would've loved it if she heard that. Tsumugi: I'm gonna text her and tell her you said that later today. Shuuji: No, please don't! Nene: I would appreciate it if you could help with that again. Meguru: Sure! It's for you two, after all. Meguru: I got her number, so she'll probably come if I contact her. Shuuji: Cool. Maybe you should ask her to bring along the friend she made up with too. Meguru: Yeah. The other girl was worried too, so she should also have fragments to get now that they've made up. Tsumugi: ...You talked to her friend too? Shuuji: Yeah. There are always at least two sides to these kinds of situations, so we went to see the other girl too. Meguru: Anyway, I think there's gonna be fragments for the both of you this time. Tsumugi: You really have thought of everything! Nene: Thank you very much. Alright, then... Tsumugi: Now! Tsumugi: Nice, got 'em all♪ Meguru: Ooh! Great job, Tsumugi-senpai, Nene-senpai! Nene: Inaba-san, no one else can see us right now... Meguru: Oh, right! If someone saw me, they'd think I'm some crazy girl shouting at nothing. Nene: Yes. Hence, I would like you to remain as stoic as possible, like Hoshina-kun. Meguru: Come to think of it, you've been pretty quiet, Senpai... Shuuji: Oh, uh... yeah. Shuuji: I was just thinking how it's strange that I can still see them when they're in witch form, even though I don't have my magic anymore. Nene: Perhaps that's because the results of your magic are still lingering. Nene: You may have lost your ability to use magic once your wish came true, but Inaba-san still has your crystallized feelings. Shuuji: I see. So that's why I can still see you. And Meguru can see you because she has the product of my magic. Nene: P-Please don't look at me too much... It's embarrassing, plus I feel bad for Inaba-san... Meguru: Hey, isn't it about time we get back? We just talked about how it would be bad if anyone else saw us! Shuuji: Oh, whoops. Okay, let's head back to the clubroom. Shuuji: Um, are you upset about something? Meguru: You were looking at Nene-senpai and Tsumugi-senpai back when they retrieved those fragments, weren't you? Shuuji: Obviously. They were right there in front of us. Meguru: You were gawking at them... Especially Nene-senpai with her ridiculously sexy outfit! You couldn't be more of a super perv if you tried. Shuuji: Why are you only mad about this now?! Meguru: So, can you tell me that their outfits didn't even slightly turn you on? Shuuji: ...No, I can't. Meguru: Thought not. Shuuji: What do you expect?! Anyone would stare at such a revealing outfit! Meguru: I. Don't. Care. Shuuji: Look... I'm seriously sorry. Please cheer up, Meguru! Meguru: No can do. I'm jealous. Meguru: Take this♪ Shuuji: ...What? Meguru: I'm jealous, so now I'll win you back by doing this♪  Shuuji: Oh, you were only playing around? Phew. Don't scare me... Meguru: Well, I didn't know for sure! I can't tell whether you're speaking the truth when you use words alone. Meguru: So I gotta do this instead. Shuuji: ...And what is this telling you? Meguru: That you really are thinking I'm the only girl for you, right? Shuuji: Actually, I was thinking, \"Man, Meguru's boobs sure are small.\" Meguru: So you really were checking out their boobs! You're such a creep. You'll never change, will you? Meguru: Now I'll never let go of you! Shuuji: Yeah, please don't. You'll stop by my place today, right? Meguru: Of course! Gotta keep our promise to always stay together♪ Meguru: So, Senpai, was that true? Am I really the only girl for you? Shuuji: Do I really need to spell it out? Meguru: I want to hear it from you. It'd make me happy if you said it clearly. Shuuji: ...You will forever and always be the only girl for me. No one else could ever compare to you. Meguru: Heh, hehehe... Meguru: ...Thanks. You're also the only one for me... Ehehe... Rub, rub♪ "

            "Meguru: Good morning. Tsumugi: Morning. Touko: Good morning, Ayachi-san! Shuuji: Morning. Nene: Everyone's here? Let's get going then. Meguru: I can't wait to see your apartment! I wonder what it's like. Tsumugi: She lives by herself, so I'm sure it's not anything special. Nene: It's just your standard one-bedroom apartment. Tsumugi: Oh, yeah? As a girl, I'm sure it's nice having a separate bedroom. Touko: Mufufu... Is the young man disappointed to hear that? Shuuji: Not at all... Touko: Really? You looked a little disappointed to me. Shuuji: If anything, I'm relieved. I'll feel less nervous this way. Touko: Oh, you can be honest with me. I won't tell anyone. Come on, come on! Shuuji: Huh?! Ahh! Wh-What are you doing, Senpai?! Touko: Really? Shuuji: Really. I mean, being a healthy young man, I do think those things from time to time... But I'm a chicken, okay?! Touko: You really are honest, huh? Shuuji: Besides, we're having a study session today. Don't say give me any weird ideas. Shuuji: Come on, Senpai. We're gonna get left behind. Touko: Yeah, yeah. Shuuji: I'm coming. Tsumugi, Touko, Shuuji: Oooh! Meguru: This place is friggin' huge! How the heck is this a \"standard\" one-bedroom apartment?! Shuuji: I mean, technically it IS a one-bedroom apartment... Shuuji: But, man... Meguru: Ah, okay. Will do... Tsumugi: It's hard to settle down in a room this big. Touko: My, oh my... I'm surprised as well. Nene: ...Is that so? Nene: I made sure to clean up in advance, since I knew you were coming over. It's usually a little messier. Meguru: Let me guess; you stuffed everything into your bedroom closet? Kinda like you see in manga. Nene: In a way. There are some places I may not have cleaned up as much. Nene: So with that in mind, I would like to you not to go digging around. Meguru: Hearing that makes me wanna search your apartment a little. Like, maybe that drawer over there... Nene: ――― Meguru: J-Just kidding! Just a little joke, haha... Meguru: It's not the same when a guy does it. There is a big difference. Touko: You can't. We've come here today to study. Don't let yourself get sidetracked. Meguru: 'Kaaay... Tsumugi: Okay, should we get right into it, then? Nene: Please use the desk over there. I'm going to prepare tea for us. Shuuji: I'll help you. Nene: You don't have to. I can do that alone. Please just sit down. Shuuji: Yeah? Nene: Oh, thank you. Nene: Repeating that process is the best way to study this, in my opinion. You can learn a lot by solving the same problems every day. Meguru: Still, there's so much to memorize... Nene: Then... try focusing on memorizing everything from here to here first. It'll be easier to remember the rest once you have the basics down. Meguru: Ugh... Roger that... Shuuji: Is there something you're not getting? Tsumugi: Ah, yeah. You see, I don't know how to do this recurrence relation problem here. Shuuji: Yeah, that one's a little tricky. Tsumugi: Hoshina-kun, can you figure it out? Shuuji: Probably. I understood the concept pretty well when we were taught it in class. Though, now that you're asking me about it, I'm not so sure... Tsumugi: How about we try to solve it together, then? Tsumugi: Though, it'll probably be you doing all the work. Shuuji: That's fine. Instead of explaining it, I'll solve the problem while telling you what I'm doing. It might be a little hard to follow, but bear with me. Tsumugi: Don't worry about that. I'm sure I'll remember it that way, even if it's not the best way. Shuuji: Let's give it a try, then. Tsumugi: Yeah. Thank you. Shuuji: Let's see... First, we need a characteristic polynomial... Tsumugi: Yeah, you got it right! Amazing! Shuuji: Yeah? Phew... Tsumugi: Umm... Sorry. I still don't really get it. Shuuji: It's okay. Shuuji: Let's try an easier problem... Actually, maybe you need to brush up on the basics of recurrence relation. Tsumugi: I guess I do, huh? Shuuji: Have you already tried and struggled with the easier problems? Tsumugi: Yeah. Recurrence relation hadn't been taught yet at my previous school, but Himematsu High was already past the basics when I transferred. Shuuji: Ahh. Yeah, that'll do it. Tsumugi: Umm... Could you teach me? Shuuji: Of course. That's why we're here. Tsumugi: Thanks! Shuuji: Then let's get right into it and start from the beginning... Tsumugi: ...... Shuuji: What's up? Tsumugi: Huh? What do you mean? Shuuji: Oh, I just thought that you looked pretty happy for some reason. Tsumugi: Yeah? I guess I am. Getting together with everyone and studying together is so much fun. Tsumugi: Ehehe... I'm having a great time. Tsumugi: I don't know how to describe it, but, umm... It makes me feel better to have someone I can share a forbidden secret with. Shuuji: \"Forbidden secret\" has a pretty suggestive ring to it, you know. Tsumugi: Huh?! Tsumugi: Ah! Th-That's not how I meant it! Not one bit! Shuuji: It actually hurts if you deny it that much... Tsumugi: S-S-S-Sorry! I didn't mean to hurt you! Tsumugi: I told you that's not what I meant! Geez! Tsumugi: Are you doing this on purpose now? You're teasing me, aren't you? Shuuji: I didn't mean to tease you... You were just so cute that I got a little carried away. Tsumugi: ～～～～～?!?!?! I knew you were teasing me! Liar! You meanie! Shuuji: I am. I'm sorry. I got a little too carried away. Tsumugi: ...... Tsumugi: I'm so done with you. I thought that maybe I could help you at Classical Japanese since I'm not bad at it, but not anymore! Shuuji: What?! Wait, I could really use the help with that! Please! Tsumugi: It's your own fault for being a meanie! Touko: Huh? What's wrong? Is there anything you need help with? Shuuji: It's about the translation of \"shikareba\" here. Touko: Lemme see... Ahh, this is Konjaku Monogatari. Touko: It's the perfect tense form of the irregular verb \"shikari.\" By adding on the \"ba,\" it becomes a conjunction that can mean both \"it seems\" and \"by the way.\" Touko: You just need to pick the translation that fits the sentence. Shuuji: Umm... Okay, so I guess it would be the former in this case. \"By the way\" would be weird. Touko: Yup, that's right. It's \"so it seems.\" But you shouldn't be content with just that. You need to learn the full meaning of these words, okay? Shuuji: *sigh* Classical Japanese is such a hassle. Touko: You're not wrong. There's a lot you have to learn. Oh, maybe the Classical Japanese would stick better if you compare it side by side to a Modern Japanese translation. Touko: Besides, when it comes to Modern Japanese, you can be tested on just about anything, but there are only so many Classical Japanese works you can be tested on, right? Touko: It is still quite a lot... But reading just one work can come in handy if you're lucky. Shuuji: Oh, that's true. Shuuji: Really? Then don't mind if I... No, wait. You can just tell me which book it is. I'll get my own copy. Shuuji: You need yours for your own studies, right? Touko: You really don't have to worry about that. Shuuji: No, I couldn't possibly. Touko: But, I mean... Shuuji: What is it? Touko: I need to repay you in some form. Shuuji: Repay me? For what? Touko: You noticed what was going on inside her, right? Shuuji: ...... Touko: You didn't actually invite me out so you could eat a parfait, right? Shuuji: That wasn't a lie... I really did want to try their parfaits. Touko: But there was a deeper reason for you inviting both me and Koshiji-san, wasn't there? Touko: I really don't see it that way. And besides, I'm not upset about it. Touko: Koshiji-san became the new president thanks to that. I'm actually thankful to you. Shuuji: Oh, no, it was nothing. I didn't do anything special. Touko: That's not true. I never noticed her feelings myself... I've always had a hard time with that kind of thing. Touko: If it wasn't for you... I might have done something really cruel and irreversible to Koshiji-san. Touko: So, I'm really thankful to you. Shuuji: I don't know about that... Shuuji: I didn't really do much, so I just feel embarrassed and awkward when you talk about repaying me. Touko: Are you sure? But it'll weigh on my mind if I don't... And I can't repay you with sexual favors... Hmm... Shuuji: Repaying me with sexual favors would put me in an even more awkward position, so please don't. Touko: Okay♪ Then I'll keep teaching you Classical Japanese instead～ Touko: Listen up. \"Ikasamani\" is the continuative form of the adjective \"ikasamanari\" and means \"how\"― Shuuji: H-Hold on a second! Touko: What is it? Is there something you didn't understand? Shuuji: No, that's not it... You're just really close, Senpai. Touko: Am I? But we only have the one textbook. I need to get close to see. Shuuji: I mean, yeah, I guess, but... Shuuji: Wha?! Shuuji: ...Are you sticking this close to me on purpose? Touko: Oh my, what a perv you are. You should get your mind out of the gutter. Shuuji: You know full well what you're doing! Don't you?! Touko: Hmm? Doing what? Shuuji: Err, well, umm... You're purposely... Touko: Come on. I want to hear what you think I'm doing from straight from your cute little mouth～ Shuuji: Y-Your... Touko: My? Shuuji: B-Boo― Touko: Boo? Shuuji: I can't say it! I can't possibly tell you that your boobs are almost touching my arm and that I can't stop thinking about your cleavage! Touko: But you just did. Shuuji: Wh-Who cares about that. Anyway, you seriously have to cut this out! Touko: It's so adorable how red your face is. It makes me want to tease you more. Shuuji: I knew you were doing it on purpose! Touko: Oh, come on. Don't get so angry. Or... do you really not like it? Shuuji: Well, err... I mean, it's not like I DON'T like it... Touko: You really are an honest boy. Shuuji: But it makes me anxious, so please stop. Didn't you say you couldn't do anything sexual? Touko: This was all just an accident. Nothing worth making a fuss over. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: No thanks. Touko: Ahh, you hesitated for a second. You perv～ I was just kidding～ Shuuji: ...You enjoy teasing people a lot, don't you? I could tell back when we ate parfaits together. Touko: That's not true. I was just doting on my cute underclassman a little to show my love. Yup, love♪ Shuuji: Oh, well, if it's out of love... Shuuji: Psh, please. I'm honored, but I seriously can't concentrate that way. So please, spare me. Touko: That's too bad. Then I guess we'll keep studying at a normal distance. Shuuji: ...Thank you. "

            "Tsumugi: Huh? But it's a girls' clothing store. Shuuji: Yeah, but I thought you might like it. Shuuji: Not at all. Shuuji: Wanna go inside? You might see some other stuff you like. Tsumugi: Hmmm... I don't think I should. Tsumugi: I wouldn't want to start feeling sick inside the store. Shuuji: Wait, that can happen? Tsumugi: It can if I touch them. Tsumugi: Once I'm free of my contract, I'll get to wear and do whatever I want. Tsumugi: So I can have fun just imagining it for now. Shuuji: I see... Shuuji: N-Not really. I was just thinking how rough you have it. Tsumugi: Really? It's probably not as bad as you're thinking. Tsumugi: Alright, now I'm getting pumped up all over again to end that contract. Shuuji: Wow... You're so strong. Tsumugi: Huh? Shuuji: I really admire how proactive you are. Tsumugi: I can be pretty hesitant too though, you know? Shuuji: If I could think like you do, the hole in my heart would be filled in no time. Shuuji: And then I could help you out of your contract even faster. Tsumugi: Hehe, maybe. Tsumugi: You better hurry up and fill in that hole so we can make my dreams come true too. Shuuji: Haha, that's a big responsibility. Shuuji: Anyway, you really do love cute clothes, huh? I remember you saying that you were obsessed with them. Tsumugi: Yeah, and then you doubled over with laughter even though you promised you wouldn't. Shuuji: Ugh, I've learned my lesson. Shuuji: I just never could have imagined that was how you ended up in this situation. Tsumugi: Hehehe. Well, as long as you've learned your lesson. Tsumugi: Actually, I used to dress like a boy when I was little too. Shuuji: Huh? Why's that? Tsumugi: My mom and dad made me. Oh, not in an abusive way or anything, though. Shuuji: Yeah, I figured as much. Tsumugi: But then I gradually started to feel that something was off. Tsumugi: But I still couldn't just suddenly change things. Wearing a skirt felt too cutesy, and it was embarrassing. Tsumugi: I mean, don't you think it's weird if someone changes too suddenly? Shuuji: I guess. I guess you really do have a hesitant side to you. Tsumugi: Hehehe. Told you so. Tsumugi: But the desire to dress like a girl kept bubbling up inside me. Tsumugi: So one day, I just said to heck with it, and completely changed my image. Tsumugi: At long last, I found the perfect outfit and decided to buy it. Shuuji: Is that the part you told me before? Tsumugi: Ahaha, yeah... In the end I bought the clothes, but I wasn't able to wear them. Tsumugi: And this was after I'd already told all my friends that I was going to change my image. Tsumugi: I had to continue dressing like a guy, and I couldn't explain anything. Tsumugi: I was really depressed back then. Shuuji: Did you hate Akagi for that? Tsumugi: Huh? Why would I? Shuuji: I dunno. A lot has gone on between you two, but you seem to get along pretty well now. Tsumugi: That's what led to me meeting you and everyone at the OC. Tsumugi: And you know, Akagi isn't in a great situation here either. Shuuji: You think? Tsumugi: I mean, if she searched for someone who had an actual serious problem, she could have gotten them to work much harder. Tsumugi: Then she'd be able to get way more fragments per person. Shuuji: Right. So the compensation you're paying is only so high because of the interest? Tsumugi: Yeah. I was so disappointed when I learned I missed out on those clothes, I actually started crying. Tsumugi: It's a silly thing to cry about, so I tried to hide it at first. Tsumugi: But she noticed, and that's why she called out to me. Shuuji: You mean Akagi? Tsumugi: Yeah. Also, think about this. Tsumugi: Akagi's always making fun of humans. Tsumugi: But if she really hated us, she wouldn't be collecting fragments to become one, would she? Shuuji: Ah, yeah, now that you mention it... Tsumugi: There must be a reason that Akagi became an alp. Tsumugi: Hehehe, maybe. She's definitely not honest. Tsumugi: But that's the same as you. Shuuji: Is it? Tsumugi: Well, you were lying when you said you wanted to go shopping, weren't you? Shuuji: What?! H-How'd you know? Tsumugi: I knew it! You were so suspicious. Tsumugi: We kept passing by shops that guys would like, and only stopping at the ones I would. Tsumugi: You were saying stuff like that yesterday too. Shuuji: Because you're helping me out, and I'm doing nothing in return. Tsumugi: Huh? I don't think that's true... Do you really feel that way? Shuuji: Y-Yeah. Tsumugi: Okay. Then let's go back to the last store. Shuuji: The mug? Not the accessory box? Tsumugi: If you don't mind... I'd be happy if you bought this for me. Shuuji: I-I'd be delighted to! Tsumugi: Oh, uh, it doesn't matter! Just hurry up and pay. Shuuji: Huh? This is the same mug I bought... but in a different color. Tsumugi: I-I guess you could say that. N-Now you have one you can use at home. Tsumugi: Though, I'd like it if you didn't tell your dad or anyone at school about our matching mugs. Tsumugi: It'd make me happy... if we could have this secret just between the two of us... Shuuji: Y-Yeah... Sure. Tsumugi: Ehehe. Treat it carefully now. I'll be mad if you break it! Shuuji: I won't! I-I could... never break a gift from you. Tsumugi: O-Oh, really? I-I couldn't break a gift from you either. Tsumugi: Ehehehe. Tsumugi: Huh? Are you sure...? Shuuji: It's dark already. It'll be safer this way. Tsumugi: Yeah, me too. Tsumugi: Huh? Shuuji: What's it doing here? Shuuji: That cloth looks like dog clothing, but it's too big... For a larger dog, I guess? Shuuji: She'd be close by if it did. Puppy: Woof! Shuuji: Whoa, what?! Tsumugi: Hehehe. It seems he's taken a liking to you. Shuuji: Normally, you see the animal taking a liking to the girl in these situations... Shuuji: Anyway, we should look for the owner. We can't just leave a small puppy out here in the cold. Tsumugi: ...Yeah. Shuuji: ...He's small, so maybe he might not have been given one yet. Shuuji: He wasn't in the stereotypical cardboard box you normally see abandoned puppies in. Maybe he wasn't really abandoned. Tsumugi: I hope not... Why do you think he has these dog clothes? Tsumugi: Maybe he went inside them because they smelled like his mom and then got left behind?

Meguru: ...You seem surprisingly normal. Shuuji: What's that supposed to mean? Meguru: Well, with the concert coming up, I was pretty sure you'd be a nervous wreck right about now. Shuuji: I'm pretty damn nervous. There's still a lot of time, though, so it hasn't really sunk in yet. Shuuji: Plus, there's a bunch of stuff I have to help with first. Meguru: The guys are making jack-o'-lanterns, right? Shuuji: Yup, we'll be carving pumpkins till the cows come home. Meguru: It's great that you're motivated, but please be careful. It'd be awful if you cut your fingers or something. Shuuji: Of course I will. Shuuji: So, what're we gonna do with the pumpkin guts? It'll be a bit of a waste to throw it all away. Meguru: We're gonna make cookies and pudding and stuff to have as snacks for the partygoers. Shuuji: Really? Pumpkin cookies and pudding, huh? Sounds tasty. Meguru: I'll give you a taste of mine if the concert is a success. Shuuji: Huh? Are you making them too? Meguru: Didn't anyone ever tell you not to judge a book by its cover?! I'll have you know I'm totally awesome at making snacks! Shuuji: ...... Meguru: Hey! You don't believe me, do you?! You don't believe me at all! Shuuji: No, I do. Meguru: Liar! You totally don't. Fine, then. I'll just have to prove it. Meguru: You better make sure the concert is a success so you get to eat my hand-cooked snacks! Promise me! Shuuji: This just adds to the pressure, really... Shuuji: But I'll do as best I can. Meguru: Then I'll do the best I can to make you something delicious! Meguru: Yeah, looks good. It suits you to a T. Nene: Really? Great. Meguru: What about me? Am I wearing this properly? Nene: Yes. It's very cute. Meguru: Thank you very much. Ehehe. Tsumugi: *sigh* So lucky... I wish I could wear cute clothes too. Shuuji: Was a costume too much for you, Shiiba-san? Tsumugi: Yeah, unfortunately... The outfit the Fashion Design Club made was so cute and girly! I just loved it! Tsumugi: But because of that... I couldn't handle it. Shuuji: I-I see... Shuuji: Well, don't let it get you down. You'll be able to wear whatever you want once you collect enough fragments. It won't be that long now. Tsumugi: Yeah, thanks. Touko: Hey, what about me? Am I wearing this properly? You can't see anything you shouldn't, can you? Shuuji: ...Y-You're fine. Everything important is covered up... I think. That's a pretty wild costume. Touko: Even I'm a little embarrassed wearing this. But I have to since the Fashion Design Club went through all the trouble of making it for me. Shuuji: ...Is our Fashion Design Club full of guys or something? Touko: No. It doesn't have any boys; only girls. Shuuji: I see... There sure is a lot on display for clothing made by girls... Tsumugi: Well, Togakushi-senpai has a great figure. Anyone with some fashion sense would want to make her costume revealing to accentuate her figure. Shuuji: Is that how it works? Meguru: 'Kaaay! Nene: Ah, don't you have to set things up for your band, Hoshina-kun? You can go ahead. Just leave this to us. Tsumugi: Good luck with the show! Shuuji: Thanks. Wakana: Huh? You've already changed, Hoshina? Should I go and change too? Shuuji: Nah, this is just a simple cloak that's easy to get on and off. You can change after we're done setting up. Wakana: 'Kay. Hideaki: I'd like to set up the drums now. Is it cool if I go in there? Shuuji: Yeah, should be fine. Ayachi-san and the others are already in there. Go do what you need to. Hideaki: Gotcha. Wakana: Well then... Guess we should do a final rehearsal? Shuuji: Yeah. Shuuji: How're you feeling? Is that cold gone yet? Wakana: Yeah, I'm fine. What about you? Shuuji: Never felt better. Wakana: Then let's do this! Shuuji: Yeah! Nene: Right, it's about time. Shuuji: Y-Yeah... Meguru: Your voice is kinda shaky. You okay? Shuuji: Y-Yeah, I'm fine. I can do this. Just gotta do it like I did in practice. Hideaki: Though, repeating what you did in practice is never easy in an actual live show. Wakana: Kaidou! What're you trying to make him nervous for?! Hideaki: I didn't mean to... I'm just wondering, is he really gonna be okay getting up on stage like this? Tsumugi: Hoshina-kun, you're looking a little pale. Touko: Are you sure you're okay? Shuuji: I'm fine. Totally fine. There's no running away from this now. I'm always ready for action when push comes to shove! Hideaki: That macho nonsense is fine if it helps calm your nerves... but you do realize your fly's down, right? Shuuji: What?! Whoa, since when?! How long has it been open for?! Shuuji: Shut up! And next time you notice someone's fly is down, let them know more discretely! Hideaki: My bad. I just noticed as I was talking. Shuuji: Man... Tsumugi: ...He looks nervous. Touko: I don't think I've ever seen Hoshina-kun this shaken up before. Meguru: W-Well, it's better than him suddenly realizing how nervous he is on stage. Nene: ...It's almost time for the show to start. We don't really have any time to help you calm down... Shuuji: I'm fine. I can do this. Wakana: ...... Touko: Ah, it's about time I made the starting announcement. Shuuji: Yeah, please do. I doubt giving me more time will help me relax. If anything, I'll probably feel much better once I'm on stage. Touko: ...Really? Okay then. Hideaki: Alright, guys. Let's try to have fun out there. If we look like we're enjoying ourselves, then the audience will enjoy themselves too. I say this from experience. Shuuji: ...Alright, let's go! Hideaki: That's the spirit! Wakana: Let's do this. Hideaki: Man, it's been forever since I was last on stage! Shuuji: Kariya... Wakana: You've practiced so hard to get here. You even kept at it after hurting your fingers. Wakana: You did great in practice, so you'll be fine here too. You've got this. Shuuji: ...... Wakana: If you lose your way on stage, then just calm down and listen to what I'm playing. Let that guide you. Wakana: Don't let the anxiety crush you, and enjoy the show. Wakana: This is your first time on stage, and it might be your last. Even if you mess up, you don't want to walk away from this with regrets. So give it all you have. Shuuji: Yeah. I don't have to do everything perfectly. All that matters is that the crowd enjoys themselves. Wakana: Right. So let's have fun out there! You and me, together. Shuuji: ...Yeah. Let's enjoy this. Shuuji: Yeah! Touko: Next up, we have a performance from our volunteer band. Is everything ready? Then the stage is all yours! Wakana: We're going to play a song for you all to kick this party into high gear. Wakana: We formed our band in a rush just for this occasion, so we can only play one song. Wakana: But we're going to pour our hearts and souls into that one song, so we hope you all enjoy it! "

His theory has something to do with time and space, doesn't it? *gets distracted* But what if the concept of time is connected to magic somehow? Hmm... that would be really interesting...",

            "Tsumugi: So maybe Hoshina-kun's subconscious is reluctant to let go of them. That might be why I'm not getting any back. Meguru: Yeah... Sorry for kinda making you comfort me... Nene: Whatever the case, try not to feel so useless. Nene: There's no doubt all the fragments we've gotten back so far are thanks to the, umm... p-power of your love. Meguru: Ah... Nene-senpaaai! Touko: Lost in thought, huh? Shuuji: Ah... Hey there, Togakushi-senpai. Touko: Can't bear to face Inaba-san? Shuuji: No, that's not it... Touko: Alrighty. Well then, let your big sis here lend you an ear. Touko: Talking to someone might help you sort out your thoughts, no matter who it is. Shuuji: ...Thank you. Touko: It makes sense that you'd be worried about the hole in your heart, given that you were born with that magic of yours. Shuuji: Right... I mean, I still don't really understand much about it. Touko: Yeah, and it's not like you got it because you wanted it. Shuuji: ...But it's true that my ability is what allowed me to start dating Meguru, so I don't hate it anymore. Touko: That's good. There's no point in hating it, so that's for the best. Shuuji: Right. I realize that my ability is a part of who I am, and Meguru loves me along with it. Touko: Ohh, what an awesome thing to say. You looked really cool there. Shuuji: Thank you... But, how do I put it... Touko: Hm? Shuuji: Meguru seems desperate to fill the hole in my heart... which only makes me feel worse about the situation. Touko: Say, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Yeah...? Touko: Magic is granted to people with wishes they want fulfilled, yeah? Shuuji: That's what I've heard. I don't know what Ayachi-san and Shiiba-san's wishes are, though. Touko: I see. But... Touko: ...What about your magic? Shuuji: Huh? Touko: Well, you have magic too, right? Shuuji: Yeah, but I just inherited it from my mom. Touko: But from what I've heard, your magic is similar but different. Shuuji: Well... Yeah... Touko: So I'm wondering why you have it. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: ...... Touko: Hm? Shuuji: Thank you. Touko: Don't thank me. I was just thinking aloud a little. Shuuji: Still. Shuuji: Meguru, sorry! Meguru: What?! Meguru: Umm, what is it...? Shuuji: I have to go now. There's somewhere I gotta go today. Meguru: O-Okay... Meguru: A-Alright then, Senpai. Umm... See you tomorrow! Shuuji: Yeah, see you tomorrow. Meguru: ...... Shuuji: Hello. Thanks again for the help a while back. I'm wondering, can you spare another moment for me? Nanao: Hmm... Okay. I'll close the cafe. Shuuji: Huh? Nanao: You've come here looking for help with something, right? Have a seat here and wait a moment. Shuuji: ...Thank you. Shuuji: ...What do you think, Souma-san? Nanao: I figured you might come to me with those questions one day... Which is why I've given them a lot of thought myself. Shuuji: I'd really appreciate it. Nanao: A witch may be gathering other people's heart fragments, but those are just the ingredients. The magic is formed according to the contractor's own wish and feelings. Nanao: So yes, it exists to fulfill their wish. Nanao: And like I told you before, there is no doubt that the ability you possess is magical in nature. Shuuji: ...But it's not like I got this ability because I was trying to fulfill some wish. Shuuji: ...Right. Nanao: And since it's magic, it also has a purpose that goes along with it. Nanao: Both you and your mother should have different purposes. Nanao: Your magic and hers are similar, but not the same. You possess your own magic. Shuuji: Which means my ability must have some kind of purpose... Shuuji: But, still― Nanao: I have a question I'd like to ask you first. Shuuji: Ah, s-sure. Nanao: Correct me if I'm wrong, but is it possible that you've been sensing the emotions of everyone other than Meguru less lately? Shuuji: Um... Yeah. I have been. Nanao: So then... Nanao: Doesn't that mean that a degree of directionality or selectivity has developed for your ability? Nanao: Basically, it's becoming possible for you to control it. Shuuji: ...... Nanao: How you absorbed the Meguru's fragments a while back is another example. Nanao: You were present for several other occasions where fragments were collected, but that was the only time you absorbed them during the collection process. Nanao: Don't you think the reason for that lies within you? Not that you did this intentionally, of course. Shuuji: So I've become able to control my ability... Nanao: ...Your magic is an extremely unusual case. Nanao: But nonetheless, it is still magic. So what this all comes down to is... Nanao: What is it you really wish for? The answer to that question is the key to everything. Shuuji: What I wish for... Nanao: Maybe your heart is waiting for you to find the answer to that question. Nanao: Maybe you're subconsciously aware that such an answer exists. Shuuji: ...... Nanao: Have a sip of coffee. Shuuji: ...Yeah, good idea. Nanao: Glad to hear that. Nanao: ...It's said that we evolved a sense of taste in order to judge whether something is dangerous or okay to eat. Shuuji: O-Okay? Nanao: However, humans have no need for that anymore. Instead, they only use it for enjoying the taste of food. Nanao: People living in this day and age never even think about the original purpose of their taste buds anymore. Shuuji: ...... Nanao: But that purpose is clear and immutable. Nanao: You have it to protect your very life. "

            "Touko: Good idea. Let's take a break, everyone. It's not good to strain yourself too much. Tsumugi: Nnngh! I'm so tired... Shuuji: Mh, nnngh... Touko: It's already this late? We must've been concentrating pretty hard. Shuuji: How about we talk about the party? Would make for a nice change of pace. Touko: That's a good idea. Nene: Then I'll go and make us some more tea. Tsumugi: Thanks, Ayachi-san. Shuuji: Hasn't it gotten a little bit dark in here? Meguru: Let's switch on the lights. Nene-senpai, is it okay to switch on the lights?  Nene: Yes, of course it is. I think I left the remote for the lights somewhere near the sofa.  Meguru: Roger that. Meguru: Remote, remote... Nene: You can't find it? Meguru: Give me a few seconds. Umm... Ah, found it. But... Huh? Shuuji: What's wrong? Meguru: ...It's a little different from the one at my home. It's smaller, and only has a few buttons. Shuuji: Wh-What are you holding there, Inaba-san?! Meguru: Well, the remote for the lights? Meguru: Alright, I'll turn on the lights now. Nene: Wait! Inaba-san! Please wait a moment! Meguru: Yeah? Why? Nene: You. Must. Not. Use. That. Switch! Meguru: Why are you talking like a robot? Nene: Who cares! That's not the right switch! It's for something else! You must not press it! Meguru: Oh, really? Then what's this remote for? It doesn't look like a remote for an air conditioner or TV. What is it? Nene: I-It's a remote detonator! Meguru: A remote detonator?! Nene: This room will explode if you press that button! You'd bomb us all! Meguru: Why would you have such a terrifying switch?! Shuuji: L-Look! O-Over here! Isn't this the remote for the lights?! Shuuji: I'll turn on the lights, so you can come back over here now. Meguru: Okay, thanks. Shuuji: Umm, Ayachi-san, here. Nene: ...Thank you, very much. Shuuji: Yeah, uh, don't worry about it. Shuuji: Anyway... Is this the remote for your egg― Nene: %130;Huh? What did you just say? Shuuji: You can't just keep pretending to be a dense anime protagonist whenever you're in trouble. Nene: God... I hate this. I'm going home... Shuuji: You ARE home. Nene: It's not like you think! It's, umm... for when the arousal sometimes comes on especially strongly... I-I don't use it every time! Shuuji: Uh, I never asked you about that. Calm down. Nene: I-It's all that stupid contract's fault! Shuuji: ...Yeah, okay. The contract. Nene: Yes, the contract. Shuuji: ...... Nene: ...... Nene: I can't take this anymore. This can't be happening. This can't be happening. This can't be happening... Death is the only way out now. Shuuji: Calm down. I haven't said anything. Nene: Your look... Your look says it all. It says that I'm a pervert for using an egg vibrator. Shuuji: I'm not thinking anything like that! Shuuji: Though, I WAS wondering why it was still out... Nene: I-It's not like you think! I'm not actually using it right now or anything! I'm not a pervert! Nene: I DID put it away! The egg itself, at least... But apparently I forgot the remote... Shuuji: So, there isn't anything else you forgot to put away, is there? We're all good now, right? Nene: Umm......... Nene: ........................... Nene: W-We're all good! Shuuji: It took you that long to think about it?! And why do you still sound so unsure?! Meguru: How far have you gotten so far? I don't know, since I've been studying the whole time. Nene: We have booked catering for light food, and we have ordered some inexpensive soft drinks over the internet. Nene: As for the party staff, we've discussed it with the Student Council and are currently making a shift plan. There should be no problems there. Nene: We also ordered the decorations on the internet when we ordered the drinks and got permission from the school to store them there upon delivery. Nene: Our overall plan has been to keep costs low by ordering through online stores that have good discounts. We'll only go out and buy the things we overlooked. Meguru: Ooh... Seems like most everything was taken care of while I wasn't paying attention. Touko: Just like I thought, Ayachi-san is very capable. She's so good at this that my help almost seems unnecessary. Nene: That's not true. I'm only able to be this efficient thanks to all the information you gave us. Nene: Except for the program. Meguru: Have we not made any progress there? Touko: We have. Our school's brass band will play at the party. Meguru: But that alone isn't enough? Nene: I wouldn't say that. But it's hard to tell until we actually hold the party. Touko: The party's main guests will be students, so we don't need anything super showy, but it's hard to tell how they'll feel until the party starts. Touko: At least we don't need a full stage schedule like with the cultural festival. Touko: But, just to be on the safe side, it would be better to have something that would fire everyone up with a whoomph.  Tsumugi: With a \"whoomph\"? Meguru: How about cavalry battle? Shuuji: That would certainly liven things up. If it were the sports festival. Meguru: A hotdog eating contest? Shuuji: Why do you keep bringing up typical sports festival events? Meguru: Then, what about a play? Touko: We did consider that. While it works for a cultural festival, wouldn't it be tiring to focus on the stage for too long at a party? Shuuji: Besides, we wouldn't be able to get the Drama Club to put together a show on such short notice. Nene: The third-years have already retired, so the club has their hands full practicing for next spring's cultural festival. Meguru: I see... Oh! Then how about embrace the Halloween theme and, like, do a candy exchange? Meguru: Everyone has to bring some candy, and then they exchange it with each other. Nene: Isn't exchanging sweets something you do on Christmas rather than Halloween? Shuuji: Giving out candy does fit Halloween... Though, that might be a bit daunting if participation is mandatory. Shuuji: Ideally, we want something everyone can participate in at their leisure, and still fun for those who don't participate... Hmmm... Shuuji: Oh, I know! How about a costume contest? Nene: A costume contest? Shuuji: You said that a lot of students wear Halloween costumes at the party, right? Touko: Yeah, a good number of them do every year. Tsumugi: So, you mean make it mandatory this time? Shuuji: No, that's too much to ask for. Shuuji: I'm talking about voting on who put the most effort into their costume, and who looks best in their costume. Meguru: You mean kinda like a beauty contest? Shuuji: Kinda, yeah. Shuuji: It doesn't have to be as grand, though. You'd need to submit your entry, but you wouldn't have to do anything special like presenting yourself on stage. Also, no separate brackets for girls and boys. Shuuji: And, hmm... As for the prizes, maybe something like school cafeteria meal tickets? We can fit that in our budget, right? Nene: Yes, we certainly do have the budget for that... Shuuji: If it's just casting a vote, everyone could participate no problem. Touko: Oh, yes, that's good. That would certainly liven things up. Tsumugi: If there's nothing weird like a swimsuit contest, I feel like a lot of students might participate. Shuuji: Well... I'm worried if we'll get enough participants, actually. Nene: Yeah, I know what you mean. The party could come around only for there to be no one willing to participate. Touko: You don't need to worry about that. There'll be at least five participants. Shuuji: Huh? Do you know anyone who'd participate? Touko: Yup. They're right here. Shuuji: Right here...? Wait, you mean... Shuuji: One...? Meguru: ...Two? Tsumugi: Three? Nene: Four... Touko: And five! Touko: See? We could at least stop the party from getting too awkward if we participate. Shuuji: Ahh, yeah. Touko: Not at all. You're very necessary. You need to show everyone that guys can participate too. Shuuji: Well, I guess that makes sense. Tsumugi: But that means that us five will definitely have to wear costumes, right? Meguru: More or less, yeah. Tsumugi: You... don't seem very bothered by it. Don't you think it's embarrassing? Or maybe you're an avid cosplayer? Meguru: No, it'll be my first time. I mean, it's a little embarrassing... But don't you think costumes will make the party more fun? Meguru: We'll have to help run the party the whole time anyway, so we might as well have fun with it. Tsumugi: Yeah... I guess. Meguru: Besides, it's not like you have to wear some kind of super sexy costume. Meguru: There'll be a lot of other people wearing costumes, so I think it'd be cool to give it a shot as well. Tsumugi: Well... Yeah, you might have a point. Shuuji: Do you not want to wear a costume, Shiiba-san? Tsumugi: I mean... It's not like I don't want to. It just seems like it'd be really embarrassing. Meguru: We'll be wearing costumes together, Tsumugi-senpai! You hardly ever get a chance like this! Tsumugi: ...... Tsumugi: ...A-As long as the costume isn't too revealing. Meguru: Of course. I don't want to dress in anything embarrassing, myself. Touko: Are you also alright with that, Ayachi-san? Nene: Well... If I don't have to wear anything weird that stands out too much, then I have no objections. Meguru: How are we going to get our costumes? Touko: Ah, leave that to me! I'll get costumes for all of us ready. Nene: Huh? But... Touko: Specifically, I want to ask the Fashion Design Club. So you all don't have to worry about your costumes. Tsumugi: Even if it's the Fashion Design Club, won't it be hard for them to prepare this many costumes on such short notice? Touko: It won't be a problem if I ask them now. I'm friends with the club president there, and she's is always talking about how much she likes making clothes for cute girls. Touko: I'm sure she would love to make costumes for you three. She would probably beg me for the honor and would hate me if I didn't ask her. Nene: Okay... Can you take care of that for us, then? Touko: Yup! You bet! Touko: My, this party is starting to sound so fun. Meguru: You said it! Let's make this the best party ever! Touko: Yeah! Nene: Well then, Inaba-san, we better get back to studying so you can actually attend that party. Meguru: Ugh... I'd rather not be reminded... Nene: We were quite productive today, I'd say. Touko: Yeah, we sure were. That was a great study session! Meguru: My head hurts a little from all the concentrating. Nene: Today would be all for naught if you end up forgetting everything. Make sure you review everything if you want it to stick. Meguru: Ugh... I know. Tsumugi: Ayachi-san, thanks for letting us use your apartment. Nene: Don't thank me. I really enjoyed studying together with everyone. Tsumugi: Yeah, I had a ton of fun too! Shuuji: Thanks for helping me study today. Nene: You're very welcome. Usually it's always you helping me out. Touko: Well, Inaba-san, think you can pass your tests now? Meguru: It's hard to say, but... I'll make sure not to waste Nene-senpai's lessons! Nene: I'm hoping for some good results, Inaba-san. Meguru: Y-Yeah... I'll do my best. Shuuji: Anyway, we shouldn't stand around here chatting forever, so... Tsumugi: Right. See you all on Monday, then. Meguru: Thank you for today, Nene-senpai. Touko: Thanks for having us. Shuuji: Have a nice weekend, Ayachi-san. Nene: Thank you. You too. Touko: I need to take the train, so I'm heading this way. Bye-bye. Meguru: See you. Tsumugi: Thanks for all the help today. Touko: Let's try our best to pass our tests too! Until next week. Shuuji: Yeah, see you at school. Enjoy the rest of your weekend. Shuuji: Alright, you both live in the same direction, right? I've already come this far, so I may as well see you two home. Meguru: You don't have to. My place is just around the corner, and Tsumugi-senpai is with me too. We'll be just fine. Tsumugi: Yeah. I'm happy you want to see us home, but don't you live in the other direction? You've already gone out your way for us enough. There's no need to go even more out of the way. Meguru: Okay, so we'll go the rest of the way alone. Bye! Today was a lot of fun. Tsumugi: It really was. Have a nice weekend. Bye-bye. Shuuji: You too. See you two on Monday. Shuuji: ...Welp, time for me to go home as well. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Man, I really am acting strange. I've never really cared about a school event before. Wakana: ...Oh, Hoshina? Shuuji: Kariya? What are you doing here? Wakana: I'm going home from guitar practice. Shuuji: Out practicing this close to midterms, huh? Wakana: Well, you know, I just needed a change of pace. Hahaha... *sigh* Wakana: As if! I'm not brave enough for that. I'm renting a rehearsal studio. Shuuji: Can you do that by yourself? I always figured that was something only bands could do. Wakana: Rehearsal studios come in all shapes and forms. A lot of places rent out small studios for solo practice. That's the kind I'm renting. Wakana: I've got some cash to play around with thanks to my job at the cafe, so sometimes I rent out a rehearsal studio where I can go all out with an amp. Shuuji: You don't do street performance? Wakana: Oh, please. I'm really not brave enough for that. And it seems like it'd be a real pain in the butt. Shuuji: Then how about forming a band? Wakana: I'm just a hobbyist. I mean, sure, I'm getting some decent practice in now that I bought my own guitar, but still. Shuuji: You've been at this for a while, though. It's been a few years, right? Wakana: Well, yeah. It has. Shuuji: Hmm... Shuuji: How about testing the waters a little? Wakana: Huh? What are you talking about? Shuuji: Want to try showing off your guitar skills in front of some fellow students? Wakana: Some fellow students...? What do you mean by that? What're you talking about? "

            "Tsumugi: So maybe Hoshina-kun's subconscious is reluctant to let go of them. That might be why I'm not getting any back. Meguru: Yeah... Sorry for kinda making you comfort me... Nene: Whatever the case, try not to feel so useless. Nene: There's no doubt all the fragments we've gotten back so far are thanks to the, umm... p-power of your love. Meguru: Ah... Nene-senpaaai! Touko: Lost in thought, huh? Shuuji: Ah... Hey there, Togakushi-senpai. Touko: Can't bear to face Inaba-san? Shuuji: No, that's not it... Touko: Alrighty. Well then, let your big sis here lend you an ear. Touko: Talking to someone might help you sort out your thoughts, no matter who it is. Shuuji: ...Thank you. Touko: It makes sense that you'd be worried about the hole in your heart, given that you were born with that magic of yours. Shuuji: Right... I mean, I still don't really understand much about it. Touko: Yeah, and it's not like you got it because you wanted it. Shuuji: ...But it's true that my ability is what allowed me to start dating Meguru, so I don't hate it anymore. Touko: That's good. There's no point in hating it, so that's for the best. Shuuji: Right. I realize that my ability is a part of who I am, and Meguru loves me along with it. Touko: Ohh, what an awesome thing to say. You looked really cool there. Shuuji: Thank you... But, how do I put it... Touko: Hm? Shuuji: Meguru seems desperate to fill the hole in my heart... which only makes me feel worse about the situation. Touko: Say, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Yeah...? Touko: Magic is granted to people with wishes they want fulfilled, yeah? Shuuji: That's what I've heard. I don't know what Ayachi-san and Shiiba-san's wishes are, though. Touko: I see. But... Touko: ...What about your magic? Shuuji: Huh? Touko: Well, you have magic too, right? Shuuji: Yeah, but I just inherited it from my mom. Touko: But from what I've heard, your magic is similar but different. Shuuji: Well... Yeah... Touko: So I'm wondering why you have it. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: ...... Touko: Hm? Shuuji: Thank you. Touko: Don't thank me. I was just thinking aloud a little. Shuuji: Still. Shuuji: Meguru, sorry! Meguru: What?! Meguru: Umm, what is it...? Shuuji: I have to go now. There's somewhere I gotta go today. Meguru: O-Okay... Meguru: A-Alright then, Senpai. Umm... See you tomorrow! Shuuji: Yeah, see you tomorrow. Meguru: ...... Shuuji: Hello. Thanks again for the help a while back. I'm wondering, can you spare another moment for me? Nanao: Hmm... Okay. I'll close the cafe. Shuuji: Huh? Nanao: You've come here looking for help with something, right? Have a seat here and wait a moment. Shuuji: ...Thank you. Shuuji: ...What do you think, Souma-san? Nanao: I figured you might come to me with those questions one day... Which is why I've given them a lot of thought myself. Shuuji: I'd really appreciate it. Nanao: A witch may be gathering other people's heart fragments, but those are just the ingredients. The magic is formed according to the contractor's own wish and feelings. Nanao: So yes, it exists to fulfill their wish. Nanao: And like I told you before, there is no doubt that the ability you possess is magical in nature. Shuuji: ...But it's not like I got this ability because I was trying to fulfill some wish. Shuuji: ...Right. Nanao: And since it's magic, it also has a purpose that goes along with it. Nanao: Both you and your mother should have different purposes. Nanao: Your magic and hers are similar, but not the same. You possess your own magic. Shuuji: Which means my ability must have some kind of purpose... Shuuji: But, still― Nanao: I have a question I'd like to ask you first. Shuuji: Ah, s-sure. Nanao: Correct me if I'm wrong, but is it possible that you've been sensing the emotions of everyone other than Meguru less lately? Shuuji: Um... Yeah. I have been. Nanao: So then... Nanao: Doesn't that mean that a degree of directionality or selectivity has developed for your ability? Nanao: Basically, it's becoming possible for you to control it. Shuuji: ...... Nanao: How you absorbed the Meguru's fragments a while back is another example. Nanao: You were present for several other occasions where fragments were collected, but that was the only time you absorbed them during the collection process. Nanao: Don't you think the reason for that lies within you? Not that you did this intentionally, of course. Shuuji: So I've become able to control my ability... Nanao: ...Your magic is an extremely unusual case. Nanao: But nonetheless, it is still magic. So what this all comes down to is... Nanao: What is it you really wish for? The answer to that question is the key to everything. Shuuji: What I wish for... Nanao: Maybe your heart is waiting for you to find the answer to that question. Nanao: Maybe you're subconsciously aware that such an answer exists. Shuuji: ...... Nanao: Have a sip of coffee. Shuuji: ...Yeah, good idea. Nanao: Glad to hear that. Nanao: ...It's said that we evolved a sense of taste in order to judge whether something is dangerous or okay to eat. Shuuji: O-Okay? Nanao: However, humans have no need for that anymore. Instead, they only use it for enjoying the taste of food. Nanao: People living in this day and age never even think about the original purpose of their taste buds anymore. Shuuji: ...... Nanao: But that purpose is clear and immutable. Nanao: You have it to protect your very life. "

I don't have my arousal fits anymore... haah, haah... I don't think I've ever once masturbated thinking of anyone or anything other than you.  Nene: Hah, haah, haah... Yes. I picture your hard, firm penis... hah, hah, hah, so ferocious yet so cute... Nene: It always feels good when you stick in in deep... I love the tip.

Gosh... you're such a handful... Go on, let it all out. *pant* *pant* Shuuji: Well, maybe I'd rather not... Nene: ...Why not? Shuuji: Kghhh! Shuuji: Nene... *pant* *pant*... Nene: Why did you pull out...? *pant* *pant* *pant* Shuuji: I just screwed up. Plus, I thought pulling out could be nice for a change.  Nene: Are you being a meanie again...? Shuuji: No, no. Shuuji: Figured maybe we could go for another round. Nene: Wh-Whaat... Y-You still haven't had enough, after everything we've done...? Shuuji: Oh, I have had my fill... But the thing is, my love for you intensifies every time I cum, so I end up wanting to keep going.  Nene: Urk... That means we'll be here all day... Shuuji: True. We can just save it for another day.  Nene: Give me a few minutes... to catch my breath. We can decide whether or not to stop after that.  Shuuji: ...Okay. Nene: We were away for quite some time... I kind of feel bad for the others.  Nene: Ah, yes. I forgot; we still have to clean up. Shuuji: We do, but we have a little something to do before that― Nene: ......? Touko: Ah, there you guys are.  Meguru: Seriously. I get that you're all lovey-dovey, but choose a different day to go sneak off together. You kept us waiting. Nene: I'm sorry. We'll help with the clean-up right away.  Tsumugi: No, that's not yet. We were waiting on you for something else.   Nene: I that so? Then what is this something else...? Touko: Well, then... *cough* Ayachi-san, thank you for all your hard work with organizing the party. We truly thank you. Nene: Huh? Ah... yes, thank you for your hard work as well. Touko: But part of me is glad I left everything to you and the rest of the club. I can't tell you how amazing you were up there on stage.  Nene: Thank... you. Touko: Then you also helped us out when we were left with no candidate for the Student Council elections... Really, you've been far too kind to me.  Touko: You're the reason I was able to see my term to completion with no regrets.  Nene: O-Oh no, I really haven't done anything special at all. Touko: Oh, but you have. Hasn't she, Koshiji-san? Koshiji: Quite. Togakushi-senpai is exactly right.  Koshiji: Plus, your singing was simply wonderful. It really fired everyone up. They loved every second of it.  Koshiji: The party would have never reached those levels of excitement had it not been for you. I mean it.  Koshiji: Also, the OC helped me with a more personal issue of mine... It had been eating at me for years, but thanks to you all, I was finally able to move on...  Nene: Th-Thank you... so much. Wakana: Yeah, she's totally right! The performance was such a huge success all because of you! Wakana: Having someone as good as you up there with me made me feel so much better. I could just focus on playing my guitar.  Nene: If you thought so, then I'm glad I helped you.  Wakana: Oh, don't be so humble! You're a lifesaver, I swear. This was my VERY FIRST live performance, and oh my god! Wakana: It felt absolutely EXHILARATING! Really, thank you so, so, so much! Nene: Thank you so much... Seriously.  Hideaki: I oughta thank you too. I might swing by the OC some time for a problem I've been having... Nene: Ah, yes. You're welcome anytime. Though, I can't guarantee we'll be able to assist you until we actual know what your problem is... Meguru: No worries, the OC can handle anything! I say that as someone who was helped by them myself.  Meguru: And I know Kawakami-kun is super thankful, too. The first date was a failure, but he told me things got better in no time.  Meguru: They went on their second date after midterms were over with, apparently.  Meguru: Since they already discussed their likes and all that last time, they knew what to do, and it turned out to be a blast. He told me to say thank you.  Nene: Oh, really? That's lovely news.  Meguru: You said it. I saw them at the party earlier, too. They were flirting away nonstop, just like a pair of lovebirds.  Meguru: Also... I think I personally owe you guys a thank you, too.  Tsumugi: Me, too. Thank you, Ayachi-san.  Meguru: I would've had to spend my three years here all sad and lonely had I not met you.  Tsumugi: And you're a big reason why I was able to make friends with everyone in class.  Nene: ...... Tsumugi: Yeah. Then you gotta go and start gazing into each other's eyes.  Nene: Ah, sorry. I didn't mean to ignore you... Meguru: Well, I'll say it again. I'm very, very thankful to you, Nene-senpai. From the bottom of my heart.  Tsumugi: Me too. Thank you so much, for everything.  Touko: Oh, and don't think we're the only ones who feel this way. Every single person who came, and consulted you―they're all beyond thankful.  Touko: This party was an absolute blast, both for us, and for everyone else who attended. And that's all because of you.  Shuuji: I also wanted to say a few words to express my appreciation for you, Nene. Shuuji: I was able to change and become a better person from meeting you. And, not only that: I was able to find my soulmate.  Shuuji: You really are incredible, Nene. Nobody else could earn the gratitude of such a large amount of people.  Nene: ...... Nene: I don't think I'm particularly lacking in self-confidence... Shuuji: I know how afraid you are of failing.  Nene: Well... Shuuji: We have no way of knowing what route will lead to the best possible future. We simply don't. Shuuji: Yet you have all these people saying you made a difference in their lives. The way I see it, that's already incredible enough.  Shuuji: So, don't be afraid. Have more confidence in yourself, Nene. You're amazing.  Nene: ...... "

Nene: Y-You know I can't possibly do that! Shuuji: Not doing anything when we're this close is driving me crazy. I at least need some stimulus.  Nene: And you want me to masturbate, to provide you with that...? Ah, yah, mmh, mhh... mh, ah, ah! Shuuji: Show me how you masturbate... Please. Nene: That's so embarrassing, though...! Mh, mhhh *pant*... *pant*... urgh... Shuuji: You say that, but your body is shaking. Let me guess, you're feeling even more horny now? *kiss* *kiss*... Nene: Ah, ah, ahhh! Mh, mhhh... ah, ahhh, mh... mh, aaah! Shuuji: Aren't you at the point where you need to do something about that?  Nene: Mh, mhh... *pant* *pant*... mhhh. Shuuji: You can masturbate at your own pace, I don't mind... *kiss*... Here, you can even use my member as a masturbation aid. Y'know, do the same thing you always do.  Nene: Mhhhh...! What do you mean, like I always do? I've never masturbated in a situation like this before.  Nene: Mhhh... ah *pant*... Your penis is just as hot. It's burning... mhh! Shuuji: Yeah, I'm too damn horny right now. So go ahead and start masturbating whenever, Nene. Nene: Mh, mmh... *pant* *pant*... mmh! Shuuji: They call it the corona. Try saying it, Nene. Nene: The corona? Shuuji: That's right. Nene: *pant*... *pant*... The corona. It has this kind of projecting border... but, despite how hard the shaft is, it's squishy here... Nene: Ah, I think I understand now. This is the part that always rubs me so intensely. This is what makes it feel so good.  Shuuji: Ah, nh... mhh! Shuuji: It does... But you're supposed to be masturbating now. Nene: Mhm, nh... Then I'll start.  Shuuji: You're really burning up now.  Nene: It's not my fault... Mhh, I didn't expect it to feel this good... mh, mhh, hn, aaaah...! Nene: Ah, y-yes... I'm okay... The corona just tugged on a very sensitive spot... Shuuji: Wait... By that, do you mean what I think you mean... Nene: My c-clitoris... When I'm doing this, the corona ends up tugging at it and... mhh, hyah, mh, mh, aaaah! Nene: Huh? How could I... I've never used a penis to masturbate before... mhh, ah! Shuuji: But you do like to play with your clit, no? Nene: Well, mhh, ah, hah, hah... Playing with my clitoris feels good... hah, mhh, I love it. Shuuji: Yeah, I remember you moaned the loudest when the vibrator was on your clit last time. I could tell you were really feeling good.  Nene: Ahh... Don't say that, mh, mhh, please don't say that. Mhh... You're going to make me remember that embarrassing experience... mmh! Nene: Ah, ah, ah...! What should I do, I can't stop my hips anymore... hah, hah, mhhh... my clitoris feels so good. Shuuji: That's alright. Keep masturbating with my cock.  Nene: Mh, mh, mh, ah, mmmh... Y-Yes, I will. I'll rub my clitoris with your corona... mh, mhh, mh, aaaaanh! Nene: Well... ah, ah, aaah... mh, mhh... hah, haah... haah... Shuuji: I can tell you're feeling good rubbing your clit, but that doesn't seem to be enough. So I was wondering if you did other things.  Nene: Haah, haah... Mh, mhh, haaah, ah, ah... What I'll do is stimulate my clitoris like this... then use my other fingers to finger myself... mmh! Shuuji: You can do that if you want.  Nene: But...! Mhh, I'd have to move your penis out of the way... meaning I couldn't use it to rub my clitoris... mmh! Shuuji: But you want more satisfaction out of this, no? Nene: Haah... haah... haah... aaah, mhhh...! Nene: Ah, ah, mhh! I do... I want to finger myself, I want to finger my pussy while touching my clitoris, haah, haah, haah, mmh, mhh! Nene: Hah, mh... mhh, mh, mhh... hah, hah, mh, mhh... Nene: Mh, but, if I do that... I won't be masturbating anymore. You said you wanted to see me masturbate... haah, haah. Nene: Ahh... but I want something in my pussy so bad... What should I do... ah, ah, aaah...!! Nene: Well... Dirty thoughts. Haah, haah... mhh, aaah, I think of you, the times we kissed, the times we had sex.  Shuuji: So you always masturbate to me?  Nene: Mh, mhh... Of course. I don't have my arousal fits anymore... haah, haah... I don't think I've ever once masturbated thinking of anyone or anything other than you.  Nene: Hah, haah, haah... Yes. I picture your hard, firm penis... hah, hah, hah, so ferocious yet so cute... Nene: It always feels good when you stick in in deep... I love the tip. Like how the corona part tugs on my clitoris like this... ah, ah, ah, ah, aaaaah!! Shuuji: I love your pussy just as much. It feels incredible.  Nene: Mhhh, mmmmmmh... hah, haah, haah, haah... mmh, if you say something like that... haah, haah, haah, haha... Nene: Why... Ah, haah, haah, haan, mmmh... all you're doing is making me crave it more... Why can't I...? Shuuji: I want to hear you beg for it.  Nene: Wh-What...? Mh, mmh... What I just said wasn't that?  Shuuji: Nope. It's gotta be sexier.  Nene: Urk... You're a monster... You're an actual monster... Nene: I-I need it... I need your rock-hard cock inside my pussy... Shuuji: And what do you want me to do after that?  Nene: Well... mmh... I want you to thrust... in and out, as hard as you can.  Shuuji: You're such a dirty girl, you know that?  Nene: Ahh... I'm sorry for being this way... but, aaah, I want more... I need more. I can't think anymore, I'm about to melt any second.  Nene: Please, spread my pussy wide open, and thrust it in all the way to my womb... Please, haah, haah, put it in... mhhh, fuck my pussy as hard as you can...! Shuuji: Okay, you may. Nene: Th-Thank you. Haah, haah, haah, I'm putting it inside then, right now. Shuuji: Uh, kgh... Nene, you're really tight near the entrance... It actually hurts. Nene: It's not my fault... mh, ahh, I've been wanting this so badly. I couldn't take it... Of course it's going to end up like this, ahhh... Nene: Haah, haah, ah, ahhh... I just love the sensation of it touching my womb and heating up. Shuuji: I love how tight and filthy wet your pussy is.  Nene: Thank you, ah, ah, ah, mmmh... mhhh... mh, mh, mh, mh! Nene: No, I'm doing it... You're always so rough. Haah, haah... Besides, it still feels like I'm masturbating when I'm the one moving.  Nene: So I'm going to move... You just sit there and continue watching... haah, haah, mh, mhh! Nene: Haah, haah, mh, mhh... So, are you watching me masturbate? Mh, mh, mh, mh, aaaaah... aaaaah!! Shuuji: Yeah, I am. You're the dirtiest girl alive, Nene. Nene: Mmh, aaah, you asked me to masturbate in front of you... mh, hn, hah, hah, aaaaah! Thish is shoo much!! Nene: Mh, mh, mh...! Ah, aaah, I feel good too. Your dick keeps rubbing against my womb... ah, ah, ah! Nene: They're moving completely on reflex, ah, aaaaaaah... Oh god, if you keep rubbing me there... I'm going to cum again! Shuuji: God, we're fucking like a pair of animals in heat...! Nene: No, it's not that... I can't control my body... mh, mh, mh, mh, aaaaaaaah... it's rubbing me, it feels so good. Shuuji: Why does it feel so good? Do you have any idea?  Nene: That's because, mhh, mhhhh, aaaahhh, I'm using your pe... penis, your penis to stimulate my pussy... ah, ah, ahhh. Nene: Haah, haah, I'm a mess... I'm losing myself.... aaaaah... Oh god, I can't take it, masturbating with your penis feels inshane.  Shuuji: N-Nene... you're tightening... up! Nene: Ish not my fault... mh, mh, aaaaaah, it just feels so good, haah, haah, haaaaah, aaaah... aaah, it's incredible...! Shuuji: Kgh... uh... you're burning up... Your pussy is on fire, Nene. Nene: Ahhh, aaah, mh, mhhh... It feels like I'm hogging the pleasure, but my body... ah, ah, ah! My body just, ah, aaaah!  Shuuji: Don't worry. It feels amazing for me... Nene: R-Really? Mhhh, aaaaaah... Doesh it really feel that good? Shuuji: Absolutely. I can't think straight anymore. I seriously can't live without you anymore. Nene, I love you so much.

Touko: Lost in thought, huh? Shuuji: Ah... Hey there, Togakushi-senpai. Touko: Can't bear to face Inaba-san? Shuuji: No, that's not it... Touko: Alrighty. Well then, let your big sis here lend you an ear. Touko: Talking to someone might help you sort out your thoughts, no matter who it is. Shuuji: ...Thank you. Touko: It makes sense that you'd be worried about the hole in your heart, given that you were born with that magic of yours. Shuuji: Right... I mean, I still don't really understand much about it. Touko: Yeah, and it's not like you got it because you wanted it. Shuuji: ...But it's true that my ability is what allowed me to start dating Meguru, so I don't hate it anymore. Touko: That's good. There's no point in hating it, so that's for the best. Shuuji: Right. I realize that my ability is a part of who I am, and Meguru loves me along with it. Touko: Ohh, what an awesome thing to say. You looked really cool there. Shuuji: Thank you... But, how do I put it... Touko: Hm? Shuuji: Meguru seems desperate to fill the hole in my heart... which only makes me feel worse about the situation. Touko: Say, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Yeah...? Touko: Magic is granted to people with wishes they want fulfilled, yeah? Shuuji: That's what I've heard. I don't know what Ayachi-san and Shiiba-san's wishes are, though. Touko: I see. But... Touko: ...What about your magic? Shuuji: Huh? Touko: Well, you have magic too, right? Shuuji: Yeah, but I just inherited it from my mom. Touko: But from what I've heard, your magic is similar but different. Shuuji: Well... Yeah... Touko: So I'm wondering why you have it. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: ...... Touko: Hm? Shuuji: Thank you. Touko: Don't thank me. I was just thinking aloud a little. Shuuji: Still. Shuuji: Meguru, sorry! Meguru: What?! Meguru: Umm, what is it...? Shuuji: I have to go now. There's somewhere I gotta go today. Meguru: O-Okay... Meguru: A-Alright then, Senpai. Umm... See you tomorrow! Shuuji: Yeah, see you tomorrow. Meguru: ...... Shuuji: Hello. Thanks again for the help a while back. I'm wondering, can you spare another moment for me? Nanao: Hmm... Okay. I'll close the cafe. Shuuji: Huh? Nanao: You've come here looking for help with something, right? Have a seat here and wait a moment. Shuuji: ...Thank you. Shuuji: ...What do you think, Souma-san? Nanao: I figured you might come to me with those questions one day... Which is why I've given them a lot of thought myself. Shuuji: I'd really appreciate it. Nanao: A witch may be gathering other people's heart fragments, but those are just the ingredients. The magic is formed according to the contractor's own wish and feelings. Nanao: So yes, it exists to fulfill their wish. Nanao: And like I told you before, there is no doubt that the ability you possess is magical in nature. Shuuji: ...But it's not like I got this ability because I was trying to fulfill some wish. Shuuji: ...Right. Nanao: And since it's magic, it also has a purpose that goes along with it. Nanao: Both you and your mother should have different purposes. Nanao: Your magic and hers are similar, but not the same. You possess your own magic. Shuuji: Which means my ability must have some kind of purpose... Shuuji: But, still― Nanao: I have a question I'd like to ask you first. Shuuji: Ah, s-sure. Nanao: Correct me if I'm wrong, but is it possible that you've been sensing the emotions of everyone other than Meguru less lately? Shuuji: Um... Yeah. I have been. Nanao: So then... Nanao: Doesn't that mean that a degree of directionality or selectivity has developed for your ability? Nanao: Basically, it's becoming possible for you to control it. Shuuji: ...... Nanao: How you absorbed the Meguru's fragments a while back is another example. Nanao: You were present for several other occasions where fragments were collected, but that was the only time you absorbed them during the collection process. Nanao: Don't you think the reason for that lies within you? Not that you did this intentionally, of course. Shuuji: So I've become able to control my ability... Nanao: ...Your magic is an extremely unusual case. Nanao: But nonetheless, it is still magic. So what this all comes down to is... Nanao: What is it you really wish for? The answer to that question is the key to everything. Shuuji: What I wish for... Nanao: Maybe your heart is waiting for you to find the answer to that question. Nanao: Maybe you're subconsciously aware that such an answer exists. Shuuji: ...... Nanao: Have a sip of coffee. Shuuji: ...Yeah, good idea. Nanao: Glad to hear that. Nanao: ...It's said that we evolved a sense of taste in order to judge whether something is dangerous or okay to eat. Shuuji: O-Okay? Nanao: However, humans have no need for that anymore. Instead, they only use it for enjoying the taste of food. Nanao: People living in this day and age never even think about the original purpose of their taste buds anymore. Shuuji: ...... Nanao: But that purpose is clear and immutable. Nanao: You have it to protect your very life. "
