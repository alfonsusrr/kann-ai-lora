            "Kousei: Morning, everyone. Suzune: Hey. Kanna: Good morning, Takamine-san. Kousei: How are the Yule Logs coming along? Suzune: We're about 80\\% done, I think. Kousei: Is there anything I can help with? Suzune: Wanna start prepping the cheesecakes for me? You remember how to do it, don't you? Kousei: Yeah. Kanna: I'll help out as well. Just tell me what to do. Kousei: Aren't you helping with the Yule Logs, though? Kanna: We've already finished rolling them into log-shapes. All that's left is to add the external decorations, but only Suzune-san is skilled enough to do that. Suzune: I'll be fine. You can go ahead and help him. Kousei: Alright. Mei: Whoa! An actual Yule Log! It looks absolutely scrumptious! Nozomi: Are you finished making them? Suzune: For today, at least. Phew... My shoulders are killing me. Kanna: I'm not surprised. You had to put the finishing touches on all of them. Natsume: Well, they certainly turned out great. Thanks for all your hard work. Kousei: We're not very busy right now, so feel free to take a break if you want, Suzune-san. Suzune: Thanks. I'll take you up on that then. Kanna: Of course. Natsume: Now then, let's get these cakes boxed up. Nozomi & Mei: Okaaay! Mei: Welcome to Cafe Stella! Party of two? If you'd rather not wait, we do have a couple counter seats available right now. Would that be alright? Nozomi: Welcome to Cafe Stella! Ah, you placed an order for two Yule Logs under the name Ota? I'll have them ready for you in just a moment. Natsume: Two pancakes, a blend coffee, and a Guatemalan coffee? I'll have those right out to you. Natsume: Two coffees; house blend and Guatemalan, please. Mikado: Coming right up. Kanna: Oh, Natsume-san! I need to go fetch some more Yule Logs from the kitchen. Can you cover for me while I'm gone? Natsume: I'll go fetch them instead. I need to put in another order anyway. Kanna: Alright, that'd be great. Thank you. Kanna: I apologize for the delay, sir. We'll have them ready in just a minute, so please be patient. Natsume: Order coming in. Two plates of pancakes, please. Kousei: Got it. Suzune: How are the Yule Logs selling? Natsume: Fairly well. Most of the customers who've placed advance orders have arrived to pick them up too. Suzune: Phew. That's a relief... Kousei: Were you that worried? Suzune: Well, yeah. I don't know if they're pranks or what, but sometimes you'll get large orders and then the customer never comes to pick it up. Kousei: That kind of stuff actually happens? I've read stories online, but it's scary how easy it is for a single person to screw you over. Suzune: Fortunately, it doesn't look like that's the case this time. Suzune: Anyway, back to work. Pancakes, was it? Kousei: Yeah. I'll handle them. Suzune: You will? Well, okay. Natsume: I'd better get these Yule Logs delivered too. Suzune: I'll help you carry them. I want to see how our customers are doing anyway. Mei: Welcome to Cafe Stella! Miyama: Hello again. Mei: Oh? You're Yuina-chan's--ah, I beg your pardon. Hello there, Mister Miyama. Miyama: Oh, you don't need to be so formal. Miyama: Actually, I'm also here to pick up a cake that I ordered. Mei: A Yule Log, yes? Wait right here; I'll have it out to you in one moment. Suzune: Welcome. Miyama: Hello again. I just can't ignore your cakes, they're so good. Miyama: My daughter's been looking forward to this for a while too. She says no other cake shop will do. Suzune: I'm flattered. I sincerely hope it's to your liking. Miyama: Oh, no need to worry about that. I'm confident it will be every bit as delicious as all the others I've had before. I'm looking forward to it as well. Suzune: Thank you very much. Your praise means a lot to me. Miyama: Oh, and before I forget. Could I also get some shortcakes, fruit tarts... this cheesecake here... and some mousse cakes, as well? Miyama: Four of each. I'm planning to give them to a few acquaintances as gifts. I'd like more people to see how delicious your cakes are. Especially since it's Christmas Eve, you know. Suzune: Would you like us to include some sort of message? It wouldn't take much time to add a simple plaque to it. Miyama: Oh, no. They're just going to be small gifts for some of my coworkers. I have to get back there once I'm done here. Suzune: It seems like you'll have quite a lot to carry, though... Miyama: Maybe, but I'll manage somehow. The hospital is only a few minutes' walk from here. Suzune: Alright. Mei: Here you are, Mister Miyama. Suzune: Ah, Mei-san. He'd also like shortcakes, fruit tarts, cheesecakes, and champagne mousses. Four of each. Mei: O-Oh, sure! I'll add those to your order. Mei: Let's see... In that case, your total comes to 11,820 yen. Miyama: Alright. One second... Wait, where's my wallet? What? Miyama: Ahh, right. I put it in my bag earlier. Phew. There it is. Miyama: My apologies. Mei: No problem, sir. Now then, you paid with 12,000 yen, so your change comes to 180 yen. Here you are. Miyama: Thank you very much. Suzune: Since you've got quite a few cakes, we separated them into two boxes for you. Miyama: Thank you. Suzune: Thank you for coming, and have a good day. Mei: Come visit us again sometime! Mei: Is he going to be okay with all those cakes? He's not going to get sick, is he? Suzune: They're not all for him. He said he's giving them as gifts to some of his coworkers. Mei: Oh, that makes sense. I guess there's nothing to worry about then. Mei: Ah--welcome to Cafe Stella! Suzune: You know, honestly, it's a lot easier making cakes than dealing with customers. Kousei: How are things looking out there? Suzune: Excellent. Everyone seems as happy as a clam. Suzune: But more importantly, why don't you take a break soon? Things are starting to wind down now. Kousei: Alright. Just let me finish up with this and I will. Kousei: Phew... Mikado: Understood. In that case, we will hold on to it for the meantime. Kousei: Yeah. Mikado: Yes... Yes... Kousei: Is there some kind of problem? Nozomi: Apparently one of our customers forgot something at the cafe, so they called to make sure it's still here. Nozomi: Yeah. They left in a rush so they wouldn't be holding up any other customers. You know how busy the cafe is today, with everyone coming in to pick up their cakes. Mikado: I understand. We'll be waiting. Goodbye. Nozomi: Are they coming back to get it? Mikado: Yes. However, he says that he is rather busy at work at the moment, so he does not know when that will be. Kousei: Then should we keep the bag in the fridge in the meantime? Mikado: No need. I am told it merely contains a Christmas present for his daughter. Kousei: Oh. But if so, he'll need to come get it by tonight. Kousei: As a parent, he's got to be feeling pretty anxious. Nozomi: Probably, yeah. Mikado: Hmm. Would you be willing to deliver it to him for us, Takamine Kousei? Nozomi: Oh, you're right! We can just bring it to him instead! Kousei: I guess I don't mind. Does he live around here? Mikado: You remember the little girl named Miyama Yuina who came to order a cake for her father's birthday, don't you? Mikado: The customer who forgot this present is her father. Kousei: Ahh. So that means I'll be going to the Miwa General Hospital? Mikado: Indeed. It might ruin the surprise for little Yuina if you were to deliver to their house instead. Nozomi: That's probably why her dad wanted to come pick it up himself. Mikado: Yes. Kousei: But that's enough reminiscing. I have a job to do. Kousei: No, I'm looking for a Dr. Miyama. I'm here to return something he forgot. Female Nurse: Ahh. Yes, I've been told. Female Nurse: Please give me a moment. He said he'd like to thank you in person. Female Nurse: He says he'll be with you in a minute. Would you mind waiting? It won't be long. Kousei: Sure. Kousei: Huh? Oh, I'm sorry. I was spacing out a little. Miyama: That's quite alright. I'm the one who should be apologizing. Some father I am, forgetting my own daughter's Christmas present. Miyama: Thank you for returning it to me. I truly appreciate it. Kousei: It was no big deal. Kousei: Can I ask you a question, though? These drawings--they haven't always been here, have they? Miyama: Oh, have they not? They were here when I first started working here. ???: Oh? Dr. Miyama? What are you doing out here? "

            "Kanna: I'm ready. Kousei: This isn't even that bad, actually. Kanna: Nozomi-san must be running ragged with all these visitors. Kousei: Yeah. She's probably busy working as we speak. Kanna: Let's just wish her a quick Happy New Year so that we don't bother her too long. Kousei: Good idea. Kousei: Oh, I almost forgot. Mikado explained your disappearance to the others by telling them you had to go home because of some family matters. Kousei: So if they ask you about, just give some vague explanation and change the topic. Kanna: Got it. Kousei: Yeah. The sauce and stuff smells amazing. Kousei: The food's a bit expensive, but there's just something too tempting about it to pass up. Kanna: Do you think we should participate next year? Kousei: Hmm... I bet Suzune-san could whip up some kind of crepe or something if we talked to her about it. Kousei: Not that we'd have to wait until next year, though. We could always try participating in the summer festival. Kousei: I'll look into it. Kousei: (I promise we'll be happy. Rest assured.) Kousei: Me? I didn't really wish for anything. Kousei: All I did was thank the gods for reuniting me with you. That's pretty much it. Kanna: You didn't wish for anything about our future together? Kousei: That's not something I need to ask God for. Kousei: Even without his help, I plan on making you happy. Kanna: A-Ahaha... Hearing you say that is kind of embarrassing. Kanna: But... thank you. I really appreciate that. Kanna: And in return, I'll do my best to make you happy as well, Kousei-san. Kousei: Thanks. Kanna: Yes? Ah, Natsume-san! Happy New Year! Natsume: Happy... New Year... Natsume: B-But how are you here?! I thought... Kanna: Well, it's a long story... but essentially, you could say... the power of love prevailed. Natsume: I have no idea what that means, but is everything resolved now? Kanna: Yes, everything's okay. I'm sorry for worrying you. Natsume: Oh... Thank goodness. That's wonderful news. Natsume: It's good to have you back. Kanna: Thank you. It's good to be back! Kousei: By the way, Shiki-san. Have you seen Nozomi anywhere? Natsume: I saw her a little while ago talking to Hiuchidani-san just outside the shrine gates. Kousei: Really? Thanks. We'll see if we can catch her. Mei: Man, that outfit really does look amazing on you. Nozomi: You think so? Ehehe... Nozomi: Do you want to try it on too, Mei-chan? You could even start working right away. Mei: Erm... Nah, I think I'm good. I'd rather just admire you shrine maidens from afar. Nozomi: Don't be like that. C'mon, just try it on for a bit! If you don't try it, you'll never know what it's like. Mei: I get the feeling you're just trying to recruit me. Nozomi: What? Well... Ehehe... Nozomi: But I really do think it'll look good on you! Honest. You'd look super cute! Mei: You think so? I don't even have it on, but you're already making me feel embarrassed... Thanks, though. Kousei: Ah, there they are. Mei: Huh? Ah, Senpai! Nozomi: Kanna-san! You're back? Kanna: Yes. I'm sorry for all the trouble. Kanna: But everything's alright now. I hope we all have another great year together. Nozomi: Me too. Mei: Same here. Kousei: Yeah. Nozomi: Heh. Kousei: What? Nozomi: Hm? Nothing. Just glad to see you're feeling better now. Kousei: ...... Nozomi: You might've thought you were doing a good job of hiding it, but you can't hide anything from me. Nozomi: Don't underestimate the power of a childhood friend. Kousei: Sorry. But yeah, I'm fine now. Nozomi: You'd better not keep worrying me even now that you have a girlfriend, okay? Kousei: I won't. Sorry. Nozomi: Good. Nozomi: Alrighty, I'd better get back to work. I'll see you guys later. Mei: Hang in there, Nozomi-chan. Nozomi: Thanks. I will. Mei: I'd better go pray at the shrine too. I haven't had the chance yet, since I got caught up chatting with Nozomi-chan. Kousei: Oh, okay. Mei: Alright. Bye, you two. I'll see you at the cafe! Kanna: See you then! Kousei: Yeah. See ya. Kanna: *giggle*! Kousei: Hmm? Kanna: I'm so happy that I get to talk to everyone again. Kanna: It's starting to sink in... I really am back. Kousei: What, you were still in disbelief? Kanna: I had my doubts, but they finally disappeared while I was talking to the others. Kousei: Was I not good enough? Kanna: Oh, no! I didn't mean that... I just couldn't help but feel like I was dreaming or having some kind of hallucination last night. Kanna: I mean, I was dying to see you and be with you again. Kousei: That kinda makes it sound like the others don't really matter to you. Kanna: Oh, I didn't mean it like that. I care about Natsume-san, Nozomi-san, Mei-san... Kanna: And Suzune-san as well, even though we didn't get to see her today. Kanna: I've lived for a very long time now, but I've never had anyone care about me the way they do. They're all very important friends to me. Kanna: However, you're more than a friend to me, Kousei-san. Kanna: Yes? Kousei: Why don't we move in together? Kanna: ...... Kanna: Okay. Kousei: Are you sure? Kanna: Well... I do love you. And since I do, we're no doubt going to end up living together one day anyway, so... Kanna: It's embarrassing... but I'm not against the idea. Kanna: ...... Kousei: ...... Kousei: Uhh. Kanna: Yesh?! Kousei: Oh, uh... Sorry. Kousei: This is it, I guess. Kanna: Wh-What?! What are we going to be doing?! Kousei: Huh? No, I didn't mean it like that. Kousei: I just meant, you know... this is the start of our new life living together and all. Kanna: W-Well, yes! That it is! Kanna: Thank you for welcoming me to your home... Kousei: No problem. Kanna: Right... The two of us... are going to be living together. Kousei: Uhh. Kanna: Yesh?! Kousei: We should probably do something besides standing here and chatting. Wanna head inside and--  Kanna: Put the head inside?! You want to go straight to penetration already?! With no foreplay or anything?! Kanna: I've always wanted my first time to be somewhat memorable, or at least have a bit more buildup to it-- Kanna: But if nothing else, I really think you should wait until I'm wet enough, otherwise it's going to be extremely painful! Kousei: I was going to ask if you wanted to head inside and relax... you know, inside my apartment. Kanna: R-Right! Of course. We can't just stand around outside chatting all day, can we? Kousei: ...... Kanna: I'm sorry. I'm just really nervous about a myriad of different things, and... urk... Kousei: That's okay. Don't worry about it. Kanna: You're right. We can't just stand in the doorway all day. Alright... Kanna: Pardon... me... Kousei: ...... Kousei: This is going to be your home from now on too. I think it's important to say it right, just so you can get into the habit of it. Kousei: Do you want to try that again? Kanna: I'm... I'm home. Kousei: Welcome home. Kanna: That was kind of embarrassing. Kousei: Yeah, a little. Kanna: But... I'm sure we'll get used to saying it soon enough. Kousei: Yeah. We're gonna be spending a lot of time together. Kanna: Okay. Now it's your turn, Kousei-san. Kousei: Alright. Kousei: I'm home. Kanna: Welcome home. Both: ...... Both: Pfft. Kousei: Alright. Give me a minute to organize my closet a bit. Kousei: In the meantime, though... what should we eat for lunch? Kanna: I'd be happy to cook. What kind of ingredients do you have? Mind if I took a look? Kousei: You're more than welcome to... but err, there's probably not much you can make. Sorry. All I managed to scrape together yesterday was a plate of omelet rice. Kousei: And unfortunately most supermarkets are closed, since it's New Year's Day... Kanna: There's not much... but you've got onions, eggs, and a bit of chicken left. Oh, and coffee too. Kousei: Feel free to have some, if you want. Kanna: Thank you. Hmm... There's also soy sauce and mirin... Seems like you've got the basic seasonings, at least. Kousei: Nozomi uses them a lot. Kanna: In that case, why don't I make oyakodon? It might be a bit light on the meat, though, since there's not much chicken left. Kousei: That's fine. I wouldn't mind oyakodon. Kanna: There's no parsley, but I guess we can do without it. Oh, but you do have some green onions. Kanna: Also... I'd like to have miso soup and a couple other side dishes as well. Kousei: You should be able to get those things at the convenience store, I'd think. Kanna: Probably. I'm going to head out and pick up a few things then. Kousei: I'll come with you. Kanna: N-No, that's okay. I'm feeling a little worked up right now... so I'd like the chance to calm down a bit. Kousei: Alright. Kanna: But just for the record, it's not because I... *mumble* *mumble*... okay? Kousei: Hmm? Did you say something? Kanna: Ngh! Kanna: A-Anyway, I'll be right back! Kousei: Hmm... Kousei: I guess I should air out the mattress before she gets back. Kousei: You can go ahead and take yours first. Kanna: No, that would just be plain rude. You go first, Kousei-san. Kousei: Nah. Since you have longer hair, it's going to take more time to dry afterwards, right? So... Kanna: I... guess so. Well, alright... I'll go first. Kousei: It's the door on your right. Kanna: Okay. I'll try to finish as quickly as I can. Kousei: You don't have to be in a rush. I wouldn't want you catching a cold or anything. Take your time and get yourself warmed up. Kanna: Okay. Kousei: It's a cheap brand, though, so I'm not sure if it's good for women's hair or not. Kanna: I doubt it'll be a problem. Though my hair is quite long, so I might end up using quite a lot of it. Kanna: So let me apologize in advance. Kousei: That's okay. I don't even know if you'll like it. Kousei: But yeah. This apartment is yours too, starting today. Kousei: You can use whatever you want, whenever you want. Kanna: Thank you. That's very nice of you. "

Acquaintance B: It's what you deserve. Acquaintance A: You said she was just a coworker last time! Hiroto: We all saw you holding hands this morning. You can't weasel your way out of it this time. Hiroto: Come to think of it, you never told me shit about this. Did you really lie to my face? I thought we were friends. Kousei: The last time she came to ask me out, we really were nothing more than coworkers. I swear. Hiroto: So you aren't now? Kousei: Err... kinda... Kousei: Now we're, uh... dating. One thing led to another over New Year's, and, well... Hiroto: Ah, so you weren't pulling my finger! It only happened after New Year's. Great. Kousei: Yeah, that's what I've been trying to say. I'm just as surprised as you are, to be honest. Hiroto: Congratulations, Kousei. Kousei: Thanks, Hiroto. You're a real pal. Hiroto: And now, goodbye. Acquaintance A: Dogs? Acquaintance B: Hell no. Fish. Kousei: Don't feed me to either! For God's sake, calm down! Hiroto: Yeah, I guess. No point in letting our emotions get the best of us. Hiroto: If you think about it, I'd much rather Shiki-san be dating one of my friends than some random fratboy douchebag. Hiroto: Actually, no. On second thought, I'm still pissed. Acquaintance A: Guilty on all counts. Send him to the gallows. Acquaintance B: Don't get hasty, friend. Torture comes first. Kousei: Don't I even get the right to a trial?! Hiroto: It just doesn't make sense, man. Kousei: What doesn't? Hiroto: I'll admit I'm jealous that you managed to get a girlfriend... but I'm willing to let that slide. Hiroto: What REALLY pisses me off is the fact that you're DATING SHIKI NATSUME, OF ALL PEOPLE! IT'S NOT POSSIBLE! I REFUSE TO BELIEVE IT! Acquaintance A: Turn yourself in, Takamine. Blackmailing is a serious crime. Kousei: %123;I'm not blackmailing her! Acquaintance B: You're using some kinda hypnosis app, aren't you?! Tell us where you got it!

After this class, we're going to lunch together, and you're gonna tell us exactly how you managed to bag Shiki Natsume. Kousei: Sorry, but I'll have to pass. Hiroto: Why? Kousei: Because I already told Natsume I'd eat with her. Acquaintance A: He's guilty. Acquaintance B: Torture him. Hiroto: Send him to the gallows. Kousei: Will you stop that already? Natsume: You seem kind of tired. Kousei: It's been a rough morning. Kousei: Been having to deal with a lot of, uh... questions, you see. Kousei: Yeah. Everyone's curious how it happened. Natsume: I know what you mean... Kousei: Oh, have you been getting the same? Natsume: Yeah. At first, they were mainly asking if I was alright since I'd been in the hospital. Natsume: But after that, all the girls in my class kept pestering me nonstop about my boyfriend. And some of the more annoying guys as well. Kousei: What did the guys say? Natsume: They wanted to know if the rumors were true, why I was dating such a boring guy. Saying I was too good for you, or that we should break up. Stuff like that. Kousei: Well... I guess that's to be expected. Natsume: Why? Kousei: I'm just saying I can understand why some people might think that way. Kousei: Not that I agree　with them, though. Kinda pisses me off, being treated like that. Natsume: It pissed me off. That's why I slugged them. Kousei: %123;Why would you reward them?! Natsume: ...... Kousei: Calm down, I'm kidding. Kousei: But anyway, how's your hand? I'd hate to think you hurt yourself over something so stupid. Natsume: I know. I was just kidding too. I didn't punch anyone, but I did give them a piece of my mind. Kousei: Oh? What'd you tell them? Natsume: ...... Natsume: Not telling. Kousei: Oh, come on. Natsume: Anyway, don't listen to them. You're my boyfriend, so you should be proud and confident in yourself. Kousei: I know. I'm not going to let a few haters get me down. Kousei: Even if YOU end up hating me--I'm sticking with you for the rest of your life! Natsume: That's a little creepy, to be honest... but you don't need to worry. That'll never happen. Kousei: Yeah, I know. I'm only joking. Kousei: But yeah, my feelings for you aren't going to change either. Just remember that. Natsume: I will. Oh, by the way, tonight-- Kousei: Sorry, but I can't today. Kousei: Hiroto made me promise to go drinking with him. If I turn him down, there's a good chance I'm gonna be murdered by a violent mob. Natsume: What? Kousei: Anyway, I can't. I'm sorry! Natsume: It's okay. I was actually going to tell you I already had plans tonight too. Kousei: Oh. Really? Natsume: Yeah... I'm having dinner with a few girls from my major program. Kousei: Oh, wow. You don't go eat out with friends often. Natsume: They said they'd only help me catch up on the material I missed from my classes while I was in the hospital if I agreed to have dinner with them. Natsume: You know how people are always calling me the \"Solitary Sniper\" or whatever, right? Natsume: Well, they were curious how someone like me suddenly got a boyfriend. It'll probably be a pain answering all their questions, but oh well. Natsume: Oh--but don't worry. They're not the same people who were badmouthing you earlier. Kousei: Hmm. So it's a girls' night out, basically? Natsume: Huh. Now that you mention it, I suppose that is what this'll be. Kousei: The one thing I'll never get to experience with you, sadly. Natsume: A girl's night out, huh? That might actually be kind of fun... Kousei: I mean, if you're going anyway, you might as well enjoy it, no? Natsume: Yeah. Kousei: Well, have fun. If anything happens, though, give me a call. Kousei: If you drink too much, or feel like leaving halfway through, I'll come get you. Natsume: Thanks. Hiroto: ...... Kousei: What the hell? Don't ignore me! Hiroto: Relax. It's a joke. Acquaintance A: We're just going out to eat, man. Acquaintance B: We've already made a reservation at the pub. Chill out. Hiroto: We just wanna ask you some stuff about Shiki-san while we gripe and bitch some. That's all. Kousei: Well, alright. Hiroto: Even if we are super fucking jealous, we're still friends, so the bill's on us today. Kousei: And here I thought I was a \"traitor.\" Hiroto: Well... after hearing those nasty rumors, I can't bring myself to mess with you any more. Kousei: What rumors? Acquaintance B: What, haven't you heard? Acquaintance A: Everyone's talking about y'all. Hiroto: Well, I guess rumors aren't supposed to reach the person they're about. Kousei: Seriously, what rumors? Hiroto: A lot of people are wondering if you and Shiki-san are really a thing. Hiroto: And, uhh, apparently a bunch of guys are saying she's, like, way too good for you, or whatever. Kousei: You guys have been saying that too, though. Acquaintance A: You can't blame us for being jealous! Acquaintance B: Yeah! I fucking hate seeing other people happy! Makes me wanna puke! Kousei: You've made that more than clear already, dude! Acquaintance A: But you know we're only kidding, for the most part. Acquaintance B: We wouldn't be taking you out if we actually hated your guts, you know? Hiroto: But apparently, Shiki-san's had to deal with people trash-talking you nonstop. Hiroto: Eventually she got fed up and said to them: Natsume: I appreciate all your concern and valuable input, but rest assured. Natsume: At the very least, my boyfriend isn't a scumbag who has to insult others to make themselves feel better. If he were, I wouldn't have fallen for him. Natsume: I'm perfectly happy with who he is. Kousei: Wow. Natsume said that? Hiroto: So I heard. Or at least, that's what the rumor mill's saying. Hiroto: Looks she's pretty serious about you, eh? Good for you. Kousei: Well, I already knew that. Kousei: But I guess the confirmation doesn't hurt. Kousei: Things must've been pretty awkward in the classroom afterwards. Hiroto: Why are you complaining? Aren't you glad your girlfriend loves you that much? Kousei: Of course I am! Kousei: But I'm worried for her at the same time. I don't want people thinking she's rude and unsociable. Hiroto: You don't have to worry about that. Acquaintance A: Apparently, most people agreed with her and thought she had every right to be angry. Acquaintance B: Even the guys who started it looked ashamed and tried to laugh it off. Hiroto: In any case, I don't think anyone blamed her for her outburst. Kousei: Ah. Well, that's a relief. Hiroto: Motherfucker. Now I'm getting pissed again. Acquaintance A: You shouldn't have told him. Acquaintance B: On second thought, you can pay for your own food today. Kousei: What?! Why?! Hiroto: It doesn't make any damn sense! Why the hell are we treating you?! You're the happy one, while we just feel like shit! Acquaintance A: Yeah! Share some of that happiness with us, why don't you?! Acquaintance B: In fact, you're the one who should be paying OUR tab! Kousei: %123;The hell?! You're the ones who asked ME out! Kousei: But eh, whatever. I guess I don't mind. Acquaintance B: Wait, really? Kousei: I don't know about you, but after hearing what Natsume said about me, I feel like celebrating. All Three: Fuck this guy. Kousei: Man, what do you want from me then? Kousei: Look, can we hurry up and go to the pub? I'm freezing out here. Acquaintance A: Where are we going again? Acquaintance B: The place we went to last time, remember? The cheap one with good food. Acquaintance A: Oh, that place. Acquaintance B: I would've picked a more expensive place if I knew Takamine was buying, though! Kousei: Hey. I said I'd pay, but that doesn't mean you can screw me over! "

Kousei: I noticed a ton of differences between that place and ours, so I went home and did as much research as I could on the subject. Kousei: I'd like to go into more detail, but sorry, it'll probably have to wait till work. Kousei: I have plans to meet up with someone after this. Natsume: Oh, sure. I have another class after this anyway. Natsume: Also, here. These are my notes from today. You probably want something, don't you? Kousei: Huh? O-Oh... Wow. Thanks. Natsume: Well, I'll see you at work then. Kousei: Yeah, see you later. Hiroto: Ah! Kousei: Wh-What's your problem, man? Hiroto: Don't play dumb with me! I know what you did, motherfucker! You were sitting side-by-side with Shiki Natsume during class and chatting with her, weren't you?! Kousei: How the hell do you know that? Hiroto: My phones been blowing up! It's already making a buzz around campus! Hiroto: The Solitary Sniper, getting all buddy-buddy with some literal who! Look, there's even a picture of you two in class! Hiroto: Please. Nobody cares about shit like that anymore these days. Kinda scary, though, now that I think about it. Hiroto: But back on topic--what's the meaning of this?! Why are you all chummy with her now?! What the hell'd you do?! Kousei: Chill out for a sec, will you? Hiroto: There's no way Shiki Natsume would want to hang out with a virgin like you without a good reason. Kousei: Can't deny that. Kousei: But you have no room to say shit. You're a virgin too. Hiroto: Stop dodging the question. Spill the beans, right now. Kousei: Well... uhh... It's not much of a story. Hiroto: ...... Kousei: I'm half in disbelief too, believe me. Though it's not like our relationship is anything special, honestly. Kousei: Just so we're clear: she and I aren't exactly close friends, so don't ask me to hook you two up or something. Hiroto: Tch... Kousei: Speaking of which, did you manage to get in touch with her for me? Hiroto: You mean my sister? Nah, I can't get a hold of her. Hiroto: She won't answer my calls, and hasn't responded to any of my texts either. Hiroto: I had my mom try too... but no luck. Kousei: You think she's okay? That's a little concerning. Hiroto: It said she read my texts, so she's not dead, at least. Hiroto: She's always been a lazy bum, so in all honesty, she probably just forgot to call me back. Hiroto: Our mom's pretty worried, though. She wants to go check on her. Hiroto: I'm heading over to her workplace right now to see how she's doing. You wanna come with? Kousei: Sure. Hiroto: Still, why do you even wanna talk to my sister? Kousei: See, I actually found a new job, and the place I'm gonna be working at is a cafe. Hiroto: Seriously? You, at a cafe? Kousei: Just as part of the opening staff. Hiroto: Can't see it. Kousei: I feel that. Kousei: But yeah, I just wanna ask your sister for advice on our sweets. See if she can give us any pointers, recipes--that sorta thing. Hiroto: And why is a part-timer like you getting involved with the menu preparation? Kousei: Well, various reasons. I'll leave it to your imagination. Hiroto: Eh, whatever. Kousei: Where does your sister work, by the way? Do we have to take the train? Hiroto: Nah. She works at that cake shop right over there. Hiroto: I think they've been featured in a number of magazines before. Hiroto: My sis brought home some cake for us once, and they were pretty damn good. Hiroto: This is their flagship store, but they have a couple department store chains... and even a location in Tokyo, if I remember right. Kousei: Is your sister, like... the head baker or something? Hiroto: Yeah, right. Hiroto: She's just a regular employee. The owner is the one who's famous. He's the patissier. Kousei: Still, though. If she's a pastry chef at the place, like... she must have a hand in making the cakes, surely. Kousei: That's pretty amazing, in my opinion. Maybe she's just been too busy with work to get back to you? Hiroto: Well, we'll find out when we get there. Cake Store Worker: Welcome! Hiroto: Umm, I got a question. Cake Store Worker: About our menu? Hiroto: Sorry, I'm not here to order. My name's Shioyama Hiroto. Hiroto: My sister Shioyama Suzune works here. Do you think I could speak with her for a bit? Cake Store Worker: Huh? Kousei: ...... Cake Store Worker: Well, uh, the thing is... Hiroto: Is she working right now? Cake Store Worker: N-No, see... Shioyama-san doesn't work here anymore. Hiroto: What? You mean, like, she quit? Cake Store Worker: Yes, I'm afraid so... Hiroto: Oh... Cake Store Worker: Is that all we can help you with? As you can see, there are other customers waiting in line... Hiroto: O-Oh, right. I'm sorry. Hiroto: ...... Kousei: You didn't know she quit? Hiroto: Nope. I never heard a thing about it from her. Hiroto: And I doubt my mom knows either. Seriously, why would she just randomly quit her job? Kousei: Are you sure she's alright? Hiroto: I don't know. I'm getting a little worried now. "

Oh, I should take a picture. Kanna: Yes, of course! I'm having a blast. Kousei: Glad to hear it. Kanna: I made so many fun memories today, eating ramen AND visiting an amusement park for the first time. Kanna: I really appreciate you inviting me along. Thank you very much. Kousei: Oh, no. Thank you for agreeing to come with me. Kanna: I have to ask, though... why an amusement park? Kousei: What do you mean? Kanna: I mean, why did we come here? What was it that you needed to do at an amusement park? Kanna: Was there any reason to bring me along too? Ah--not that I don't appreciate it. I really am enjoying myself. Kanna: But I was having so much fun that I completely forgot to ask what you wanted to do here in the first place. Kousei: Right... Kousei: Well, don't worry about it. I've already done what I came here to do. Kanna: You did? Already? Kanna: Well, I hope I wasn't getting in the way. Kousei: It's nothing much... but here. I got you a new case and a portable charger for your phone. Kanna: ...... Kousei: It might be a little too practical for a gift, but I thought it'd be better than something you'd never use. Kanna: Thank you... very much... Kousei: Yeah, of course. Thank you. Kousei: This makes me really happy. Seriously. Kanna: Me too. But... are you sure about this? Kousei: What? Kanna: Giving me this present... and spending your holiday with me. I thought you would have wanted to spend it with someone else. Kousei: Why would I? If anything, there wouldn't have been any point coming here without you. Kanna: What do you mean? Kousei: ...... Kousei: I wanted to come with YOU, Akizuki-san. Kanna: H-Huh? Wait... Whaaat? Kanna: ...... Kanna: Up until now... I haven't explained very much about myself to you, or about us Grim Reapers, have I? Kousei: Huh? O-Oh, no. I guess not. Kanna: This seems like a good opportunity to do so. Will you listen to what I have to say? I want you to understand something, Takamine-san. Kousei: Like, right now? Kanna: Right now. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Alright. Kanna: Thank you. Now then... Where do I begin? Kousei: Well, for starters, you did tell me before that your job was to guide the souls of the dead, and capture wayward butterflies. Kanna: What I'm about to tell you goes beyond that. Kanna: I told you that butterflies were remnants of lingering souls that have lost their attachment to life, didn't I? Kanna: But what do you think happens to these butterflies once I collect them and return them to the other side? Kousei: \"What happens to them\"? Well... they get reincarnated, don't they? Kousei: I thought that's why you captured them in the first place. Kanna: That is the eventual goal, yes, but first, it's necessary for them to regain their will to continue living. Kanna: And that is why souls that become butterflies are returned to the world in a different form. Kanna: They are then given a certain job. A job that involves touching the lives of many different people. Through this, they are meant to regain an interest and attachment to the world around them. Kousei: Wait... Kousei: So what you're saying is-- Kanna: Yes. Grim Reapers are temporary beings. It's like a transitional phase that prepares us to be born anew. Kanna: That is why we do not experience physical change, nor are we able to die. Kousei: So once this transitional phase ends... you'll be reincarnated for real? Kanna: Indeed. I will be born again, and lead a new life once more. Kousei: ...... Kanna: I've been enjoying myself a lot. Kanna: The time we've spent today at the amusement park. The ramen we had for lunch, and at the yakiniku we had the other day, too. Filling my phone with more and more memories. Kanna: I've been living for quite a long time now, but this has been the most fun I've ever had. Kanna: Working together with you, and Natsume-san, and Nozomi-san, and Mei-san, and Suzune-san... Kanna: Seeing so many customers smile and tell us how delicious our food is... All of it has made me so happy. Kanna: Compared to all the years I've lived until now, this may only be an extremely short period of time. Kanna: But it's also been... the brightest time of my life. Kanna: Every single day feels so joyous, and so fulfilling. Kousei: N-No problem. I'm... glad you had fun. Kousei: ...... Kousei: But it's only natural, since it's also the first time I've ever confessed to anyone. Kousei: ...... Kousei: If anything, it feels like there's been no clear outcome. Kousei: Urgh... Kousei: Maybe it would've been better if she'd just outright rejected me after all? Kousei: No, that would probably just hurt even more. I might've even cried... Kousei: ...... Kousei: Arrgghh! This is torture! Kanna: ...... Mikado: What is the matter? Did something happen? Kanna: You can tell? Mikado: Obviously. Kanna: ...... Mikado: If you want me to leave you alone, then stop acting like that. Mikado: It only makes you seem like some petulant child who wants someone to listen to them. Kanna: The truth is, the outing Takamine-san invited me on today... was apparently a Christmas date. Mikado: Did you two get into a fight or something? Kanna: No. Quite the opposite, actually. Kanna: I think Takamine-san wanted to confess to me... Probably. Mikado: Probably? Kanna: I stopped him before he could say it, and told him that I wouldn't be around for much longer. Mikado: I see. Kanna: I just want him to be happy. That is my only wish. Mikado: But he chose YOU, did he not? Kanna: That's exactly why I can't reciprocate his feelings. It can't be me. It has to be someone who he can actually be with. Mikado: I suppose that is true... Kanna: Look at him now. He's completely changed from before. He's become such a positive person. Kanna: But even so, I can't be the one to be with him. He deserves to find true, lasting happiness this time. Mikado: ...... "

            "Kanna: If the situation continues to go downhill, I'm worried that a real witch hunt or witch trial might take place. Mikado: Of course, I doubt we have to worry about anyone being burned at the stake. However, it is likely that Mei will be shunned even worse than before. Kousei: We have to make things right with her friend then. Kanna: Right. I'd like to see them make up as soon as possible. Kanna: But the question is... just how much does Mei-san's friend believe in her powers? Kanna: Hopefully, all she thinks is that Mei-san's \"spell\" makes her feel better; not that it actually fixes her problem. Kanna: If that's the case, then it may be possible to sweep this incident under the rug by refraining from using her powers again in the future... Mikado: But if she truly believes that Mei possesses unusual abilities, then that complicates things. Mikado: Even if they were to reconcile with each other, her perception of Mei as \"abnormal\" would inevitably become a source of discord between them. Kanna: I'm inclined to agree... In which case, perhaps it would be best to bring her into the fold. Kousei: Well, whatever we decide, what am I supposed to tell Mei? I'd rather avoid mentioning any of that witch hunt or witch trial stuff. Kousei: I don't want to make it sound like her friend has ill-intentions either... Kanna: Let me handle it. I'll talk to her. Kanna: As it so happens, I'm going to meet her after this anyway. Kousei: Huh? You are? Kanna: Yes. She's having a study session over at Suzune-san's apartment, and I was invited to go as well. Kousei: Oh... She did mention she asked Shiki-san to help her study. That was today? Kanna: I know you're worried about her as her boyfriend, but please let me handle it. I'll speak to her. Kousei: Alright. I'll leave it to you. Mikado: Still... I do feel partly responsible for all of this. It was I who urged her to begin actively using her powers, after all. Kousei: Er, this actually happened back when Mei was still in the swimming club. Mikado: Oh, I see. So this was before we met. Mikado: Still, all the more reason we ought to have noticed Mei's existence even sooner. Mikado: If we had, we could have taught her how to use her powers before this happened. Kanna: There's no point in lamenting over hypotheticals, Your Excellency. Mikado: I suppose you're right. In any case, we'll decide after you talk to her. Kanna: Right. Anyway, I'd better get going soon. I'm already running late. Kousei: See you later. Kanna: See you later. Kanna: Sorry I'm late! Suzune: There she is. Mei & Nozomi: Good evening! Kanna: Good evening. It's been a long time since our last one of these, huh? Natsume: What was holding you up at the cafe? Kanna: Just some business with the smoker. It didn't seem like I was really needed, though, so I left the rest to Mikado-san. Suzune: Come on, take a seat. Kanna: Thank you. Suzune: Without further ado! Now that everyone's here, let's start talking juicy stories! Mei: Come again? Nozomi: Juicy stories? Kanna: I was told that this was supposed to be a study session... Now I see why I was invited too. Natsume: Well, Suzune-san's already started drinking. Mei: She opened her first can of beer before we could even open our textbooks. Suzune: I wanted a drink, so what? Not like there's anything for me to teach you anyway. Nozomi: Um, Natsume-san? About this question here... Natsume: Which one? Suzune: Whoa now. You're not seriously studying, are you? This isn't the time for that. Mei: This is exactly the time, actually... Suzune: That's where you're wrong. Now's the time for you to spill all the juicy details about how far you and Kousei have gone! Mei: What? No way. Absolutely not. Kanna & Natsume & Nozomi: ...... Mei: Why is everyone suddenly sitting at attention? And you too, Nozomi-chan? Nozomi: Ahaha... Sorry. To be honest, I'm more interested in hearing about that than studying... Mei: *sigh*... Alright, alright... I guess we're not getting any studying done... Suzune: So how'd it go? Did you two manage to talk things out? Mei: Talk what out? Suzune: You know. How far he wanted to take things and all that. Mei: Well... yes... We did talk about it... Kanna: Oh-ho? Your face is turning rather red. Natsume: Ah. You've kissed, haven't you? Mei: ...... Nozomi: Ahh! You did?! Suzune: Hold on a second. Something's off about her reaction. Kanna: Somehow... She seems a little flustered... Natsume: What? No way... Seriously? Have you actually... Mei: ...... Suzune: What? You're not saying anything... Mei-san, don't tell me... Mei: ...... Suzune: You did the deed? Mei: ...... Suzune: From start to finish? Mei: ...... Mei: I-I will refrain from answering that question... Suzune: Oh my gosh! You guys actually did it! Natsume: No way. That's way too... I mean, you literally just started dating, didn't you? How many days has it been? Nozomi: They started going out on Valentine's Day, so... including today, it's been five days? Kanna: Then that means on the third or fourth day, you already... Natsume: A-Aren't you taking things a little too fast? I know we egged you on and all, but still... isn't that a little too fast?! Suzune: When was it? What day? Tell us! Mei: Wh-What? Suzune: Wait. Are you implying you've done it more than once? How many times have you had sex already? Natsume: Seriously? You've done it multiple times in just five days?! Nozomi: Wow... I'm in total awe, Mei-chan... Kanna: It's hard to believe that our pure, innocent little Mei-san has lost her virginity to a man... Natsume: And not just the one time... Suzune: Letting Kousei penetrate her petite body with his ding-a-ling over and over... Natsume: And sucking on it too... Suzune: His ding-a-ling... Natsume: His ding-a-ling... Mei: Um... I get that you like saying that word, but can you please stop repeating it? Suzune: Lewdidani... Natsume: Lewdidani Mei... Mei: Would you stop it already?! It's not funny! I don't even know what you're saying anymore! Suzune: Just come clean already. You guys had sex, didn't you? Mei: Well... y-yeah, we did. So what? Suzune: How many times? Mei: Wh-Why do I have to answer that?! Suzune: How many times?! Mei: Fine. Just twice. Suzune: Twice?! Natsume: Did you give him any blowjobs? Mei: Y-You're really curious about that, aren't you, Natsume-senpai? Natsume: Answer me. Did you or did you not? Mei: Yes. Natsume: Oh... Suzune: ...... Mei: Huh? Why did everyone go quiet all of a sudden? Kanna: The fact that the most pure and innocent one out of all of us is now the only one to have gone that far with a man is quite the shock, to be honest. Mei: What? But you're the ones who forced me to tell you about it... Suzune: I can't even tease her about it anymore... Natsume: She now has more life experience than the rest of us... Mei: More LIFE experience? That's a bit of a stretch... Nozomi: Well, I'm happy for you. I'm glad things are going well. Mei: Y-Yeah, thanks to you guys... We're doing very well... Kanna: Still, I have to say things are moving very fast between you two. Not to be rude, but I always imagined Takamine-san to be a bit of a chicken. Nozomi: Ehehe. He is definitely a bit of a late bloomer. Mei: Well, you know... Not that I'm any better, but Kou-kun-- Suzune & Natsume: Kou-kun?! Mei: Urgh... I've done it now... Nozomi: Aww. That's what you call him when you're alone? Mei: Ahh, gosh! I should've been more careful! Kanna: Takamine-san accidentally called you \"Mei\" earlier too. Natsume: What a couple of lovebirds... Suzune: Alright, we get it. No need to rub it in... Mei: I'm NOT doing that! Calling him Kou-kun was an accident, but everything else I only said because you forced me to! I'm DEFINITELY not trying to brag! Suzune: Ahh, I can't take this. I need another drink. Natsume: Can you get me one too? Suzune: Sure can. Join the party. Mei: Wait... I thought we were studying... Suzune: All I have is beer. That okay? Natsume: That's fine. Thank you. Kanna: I guess this is only the beginning. Mei: I mean, I had a feeling that was going to happen, but still... Mei: ...... Mei: Man, why'd I even come here? Nozomi: Ahaha... Nozomi: Goodnight, everyone! Mei: Goodnight! Natsume: Alright, I'm headed this way. Goodnight. Mei: Goodnight! Kanna: Have a good night. Mei: Well, I'm headed this way too. Kanna: Let me walk you home. Mei: Huh? That's okay. It's not that far from here. Kanna: I have a little something to discuss, actually. Mei: O-Oh, okay. Did... Did Kousei-senpai tell you about it? Kanna: You can call him Kou-kun. I don't mind. Mei: N-No. I'm not falling for that! Kanna: Nihihi. Come. Let's walk while we talk. Mei: Okay. Kanna: I hear that you and your friend have had something of a falling-out. Mei: I had a feeling that was what this was about... Yeah, it's true. Because of my eye. Mei: Now I understand why you warned me so many times not to attract attention to the power of my eye. Mei: But because I used it so carelessly... Kanna: Your friend became dependent on its power. Mei: Right. If only I'd tried to help her in secret, things might not have turned out this way... Mei: But... I only realize my mistake in hindsight. Kanna: Indeed. If she hadn't known that this \"magic spell\" was your doing, she may not have come to rely on it. Mei: Yeah... I'm sorry. Kanna: There's no need to apologize. It's not as if you were abusing your power. In fact, you even tried keep your left eye hidden. Mei: Well... I suppose. Kanna: All you did was make a decision to use your power to help your friend. I can't blame you for that. Kanna: And in the first place, this happened before we'd even met. If this were a more recent incident, I may have scolded you a little, but that's not the case. Mei: Still, though... I feel like it was a rash decision. Kanna: Let me to ask you something. Did you quit the swim team because you were being blamed for not using your powers? Mei: Uh... Well... Kanna: Rest assured. I won't tell Takamine-san. This is between us. Mei: ...... Mei: It definitely became... uncomfortable for me. Mei: It's true that the others criticized me for not using my spell... Mei: But that's not the only reason I left. Kanna: You felt that if you didn't leave, your friend would only continue relying on your powers. Mei: Yes. I realized that my being there wasn't good for her. Mei: So I made up my mind, and quit the team. Mei: I was confident that she, of all people, could overcome her struggles even without my help. Mei: But... Kanna: Your friend's mental state still hasn't recovered. Mei: So it seems. And what's more, it seems like she's angry at me too... Mei: I, um... I know it's my own fault she's angry with me, so I can't do anything about that. Mei: But if it's because of my spell that her slump is still going on, then I can't just keep my distance from her anymore... Kanna: You want to do something for her. Mei: Yes. But even if I offered to help, I get the feeling she'd only ask me to cast my spell on her again... so I don't know what to do. Mei: Oh... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to ramble on about my personal problems like that. Kanna: Not at all. Kanna: If your friend is attracting butterflies, then her situation is of concern to me as well. Kanna: But that said, we don't have any sort of connection with her that would give us an excuse to intervene. Mei: That's true... I'll try to think of something on my own. Kanna: Oh, you don't have to do that. I don't plan on dumping all the responsibility on you, Mei-san. Mei: But this is all my fault in the first place, so... Kanna: Don't be so reserved. We're not strangers anymore, are we? Kanna: Or so I'm sure Takamine-san would say. Mei: Ah... Mei: ...... Mei: Would you... be willing to lend a hand? Kanna: Why of course. I'll do everything in my power can to help. Mei: Th-Thank you so much! Kanna: Let's try to look at things in a positive light. Since your friend knows about the sort of powers you possess... Kanna: Perhaps it would be a good idea to bring her into the fold as well. Mei: Bring her in? You mean, invite her to work at the cafe too? Kanna: Well, not that far. But if you could invite her to the cafe as a customer, that would give us a chance to establish a connection with her. Mei: Ohh, okay... Kanna: Once we see how she's doing, we can explain to her about her butterflies. Mei: And about my eye too, right? Kanna: Let's try to avoid that for now. All she needs to know is that you're the one who drove away her butterflies. Mei: ...... Kanna: Does it bother you, having to hide things from your friends? Mei: No... I've been hiding the truth about my eye for a long time now. Kanna: Then let us continue keeping it hidden. We'll tell your friend that you can see butterflies, and that there are other people who can see them as well. Kanna: Once she becomes aware of that, she should come to stop relying on you alone. Kanna: The most important thing is that we keep the power of your eye a secret. In the past... Kanna: ...... Kanna: No, never mind. It would simply be easier on your future school life if nobody else knew you possessed special powers. Mei: Alright. So for now, I should try inviting her to come stop by the cafe? Kanna: Right. First, we'll have her come visit the cafe as a customer. Kanna: I'll leave it up to you to decide when to invite her. Of course, feel free to wait until after your exams are finished. Mei: Okay. Got it. Kanna: That's all I wanted to discuss. We're almost at your house, aren't we? Mei: Oh, yes. It's just up here. Kanna: Well, good luck with your exams. Mei: Thank you very much! Kanna: Have a good night. Mei: Goodnight! Mei: ...... Mei: She's right... It's about time we made up. Mei: Alright. Let's do this! "

To be honest, I just wanted to create a space where people can relax and talk without all the noise and distractions that come with university life. You know, a place where you can actually think and study in peace? Yeah, that's basically it. Plus, I love baking and making sweets, so it was a great excuse to share my creations with others.

        "generated_ollama_with_rag": "*sigh* Fine. If you must know, it's because I had to get out of my parents' house after they kicked me out for being \"too stubborn\" and having a \"bad attitude\". I didn't want to live with them anymore anyway. The owner of the cafe next door happened to be an old friend of mine, and she offered me a job...or rather, an apprenticeship in exchange for living rent-free on the second floor.

Kanna: A postage stamp? Nozomi: Not that kind of stamp. They're sort of like stickers you use to decorate the picture. See? Kanna: Goodness... I can hardly keep track of all these different features!

Kousei: You're not working too hard or anything, are you? Nozomi: I told you, I'm fine. I'm not lying, really. Stop worrying. Kousei: Well, if you ever need help with anything, just lemme know. Nozomi: Hmm... Kousei: Is there actually something? Nozomi: It's not urgent or anything, but I kinda wanna brush up on my coffee- and tea-making skills. Kousei: You've been practicing, haven't you? Nozomi: Yeah, but compared to Kanna-san or Natsume-san's, my drinks are somewhat... off. It's hard to put my finger on what, but it's definitely missing something. Kousei: But it doesn't taste bad, does it? Nozomi: Most customers probably wouldn't have a problem with it... Nozomi: But I don't know if it'd be able to satisfy those customers who come specifically for a cup of coffee or tea. Kousei: Do we get a lot of those customers? Nozomi: Some days? We've been getting a lot more of them lately, though. They like to come in during the mornings or evenings when the cafe isn't as busy and just order a drink. Kousei: Guess I hadn't noticed since I don't handle drinks. Nozomi: They're nothing at all like our usual guests. Nozomi: It's like, whenever I take their orders, they're implicitly saying, \"I hear you make a mean cup of coffee. I'll be the judge of that!\" or something. Kousei: Sounds pretty pretentious. Nozomi: I'm not just imagining things, either. They really do act all snobby. Nozomi: That's why I've been meaning to practice more... but these customers don't make it easy. Kousei: Right. Nozomi: Okay, I'm good here. Thanks for walking me home. See you later! Kousei: See ya. "

Miyama: We already had the Christmas concert, didn't we? Patient: No, no. I meant something more personal. Don't you wanna give a gift to your cutest patient? Patient: I promise I won't tell your wife and daughter. Miyama: Will you PLEASE stop saying such misleading things?! Female Nurse: Dr. Miyama? Miyama: It's not what it sounds like! This is just another one of her sick jokes! Miyama: *sigh* Alright. You can have some of the cake I bought. But keep it a secret between us, okay? Patient: Okie dokie. Your wife and daughter will never have to know. Miyama: Cut it out. That's really not funny. Miyama: But come to think of it--didn't you say you stayed here a couple years back? Patient: Yep. Miyama: Would you happen to know anything about these drawings on the wall? Patient: What's there to know? I know that they were drawn by other kids in the hospital, at least. Patient: Actually, one of 'em is mine. See the one with the mountain climber? I drew that. Miyama: Oh, really? Then it seems you got what you wished for. Patient: I guess so. Although I did end up breaking my ankle on the climb... The forecast didn't say anything about rain. Patient: But anyway, why do you ask? Miyama: This young man says these drawings weren't always here. Patient: He's right. They started this tradition years ago, the last time I was hospitalized here. Patient: If I remember correctly... there was this patient who was a relative of some famous painter, and she'd get mailed these different paintings when her family couldn't come to visit... Kousei: ...... Patient: When the doctor at the time saw those, he decided to ask the kids in the hospital to draw their favorite things too, so they could use them to decorate the hospital. Miyama: Really? I had no idea. Miyama: If you have any questions about these drawings, she might be able to answer them for you. Kousei: Thank you, but I've heard enough. Miyama: Oh. Are you sure? Kousei: Yes. I was just a little curious; it's nothing important. Kousei: Anyway, I'd better get going. I need to get back to work. Miyama: Alright. Thank you again for today. I really appreciate it. Kousei: No problem. I hope we'll see you again. Miyama: Of course. I'll definitely come by and visit again. Patient: What are you talking about? Miyama: He works at a nearby cafe. They make some amazing cakes. Patient: Ohh! Is that where you bought those cakes? Miyama: It sure is. You're in for a treat. Patient: Woohoo! Kousei: Now then, if you'll excuse me. Miyama: Take care. Kousei: I'm back. Mikado: Everything went well, I hope? Kousei: Yeah. I handed the present back to Miyama-san himself. Mikado: Ah. That's good to hear. Mikado: Feel free to rest for a while before getting back to work. I will let the others know where you are. Kousei: Thanks, but I'm fine. The hospital wasn't that far. Mikado: Alright. As you wish. Mei: Phew! We made it, somehow. Nozomi: Thank goodness we didn't have any problems. Mei: Yeah, you said it. Suzune: Well, let's cut into this Yule Log. Nozomi: Don't tell me you saved one just for us? Suzune: As much as I'd like to say so, this is actually just a leftover from today's cancellations. Suzune: It hurt to throw out the rest, but I couldn't bring myself to sell them tomorrow at half price. We aren't a convenience store or a supermarket. Nozomi: Well, I got a good workout today, so I guess a little cake won't hurt. Yep! Ehehe! Mikado: Hmm. I hate to put a damper on things, but I will have to pass on the cake. Mikado: I am not very fond of sweets, personally. Especially if it contains fresh cream. Mei: Oh, really? Mei: Aww, yeah! Nozomi: Don't mind if we do! Suzune: Would you want me to whip up something else for you instead, Mikado-san? Mikado: That is quite alright. As long as my food isn't of the dry variety, I will be fine. Suzune: Come again? Mikado: Don't worry about it. But in any case, I appreciate the thought. Mikado: ...... Natsume: Okay. I get the message. Mikado: Mhm. Thank you kindly. Mikado: Now if you'll excuse me, I must go calculate our total sales for today. Mei: Someone's in a good mood. Nozomi: Yeah, it's not often you see Mikado-san smiling like that. Suzune: And what was that about \"dry food\"? Does he usually eat overcooked meat or something? Kanna: He just has more picky tastes in food than the average person. He probably just didn't want to impose. Mei: Now that you mention it, I don't think I've ever seen him eating lunch at work before. Kanna: At any rate, I'm sure Mikado-san means it when he says he appreciates the thought. Suzune: Well, if you say so. Suzune: Anyway--good work today, guys. Kanna: You especially, Suzune-san. You carried most of the weight. Natsume & Nozomi & Mei: Thank you. Kousei: So, do you think business is going to start slowing down tomorrow? Suzune: That's how it was at Patisserie Sourian in the days leading up to the New Year, at least. Natsume: We are getting more popular around the neighborhood these days, but a lot of our customers are also students. Natsume: And since it's winter break, we're probably going to have fewer customers than usual. Suzune: On the bright side, I guess that means less cakes we'll have to bake. Natsume: Still, I hope our customers don't forget about us after the holidays. Mei: With how delicious this Christmas cake is, I don't think we have to worry about that. Nozomi: Definitely. I don't see how anyone could forget Suzune-san's cakes; they're way too delicious! Suzune: Speaking of cakes, I'm also thinking of doing another special promotion for the new year. Kousei: Oh? What do you have in mind? Suzune: A Mont Blanc. Also, a pancake with extra strawberries, as a limited-time winter special. What do you think? Mei: Hmm... If those pancakes sell well, we might even get another huge boost in customers! Mei: I feel like my friends at school are always talking about strawberries. Kousei: Oh, really? Suzune: Well, let's save that discussion for later. We're all exhausted, so for now, let's just take it easy and relax. Nozomi: Would you like me to rub your shoulders? I give my dad massages, and he says I'm really good at it. Suzune: Seriously? Well, if you're offering, I guess I'll have one. Nozomi: Sure thing. Don't mind if I do. Nozomi: Glad to be of service! Ehehe. Kousei: ...... Kousei: ...... Kousei: I'm not. Kanna: Aww, you silly thing. Don't lie: you got a little aroused there for a second, didn't you? And then you thought, \"Nevermind, I take that back.\" Kousei: Well, it's kinda hard to feel aroused when she starts moaning like an old geezer. Kanna: Nihihi! Disappointed, weren'tcha? Kousei: Oh, leave me alone. Kousei: Sure, I guess. Can we not do it now? Natsume: Well... there's something I want to give you. Kousei: Okay? Natsume: Here's a hint. What day is it today?

Natsume: Sure, go right ahead. It's all yours, Takamine-kun... Kousei: Alright. Don't mind if I do! Kousei: Mhh! This is good... Natsume: I used lard instead of oil when making the dough, and added Chinese soup and shiitake broth to the meat inside. Kousei: Well, it's a huge improvement. These are really good. Kousei: I can definitely see why Suzune-san suggested these changes. Kousei: These added flavors really enhance the taste. Natsume: I'm glad the difference is that noticeable. Natsume: I thought they turned out pretty well myself, but I wanted to get a second opinion. Kousei: So that's why you invited me over? Natsume: Yeah. Sorry to bother you on Christmas. Kousei: It's okay. Not like I had anything else to do, really. Kousei: But I wish you could've just asked me normally, instead of being so, y'know... suggestive. Natsume: Oh, did I get your hopes up? Kousei: You were doing it on purpose, weren't you? Natsume: Maybe. So, what day is it today? Kousei: Six days before the new year. Meaning, less than a week to go until the festival. Natsume: Ding ding ding. You're right. And as a reward for answering correctly, you get one more new-and-improved meat bun. Kousei: Whoopee. I'm so happy. Natsume: That sounded a lot like sarcasm. Girls don't like it when you make fun of them, you know? Kousei: Yeah, well, guys don't like it when you play with their feelings by pointlessly leading them on. Kousei: Or was this all part of your master plan to tease me? Natsume: Oh, please. I'm not that bored. Natsume: I'll get them to try it too, just once it's perfected. I didn't want to have too many different taste-testers all telling me what to change at once, you know? Natsume: I hope so. Unlike with the cafe, we won't have enough time to rely on word of mouth to attract customers. Kousei: Well, that's what the qipao is for, isn't it? Natsume: Urk... Can you not remind me? That was way too embarrassing. Kousei: But you said you'd wear it, didn't you? Natsume: Well, yes. Kousei: Welp, I guess I better get going now. Natsume: Ah--wait a minute. I've got one last question for you. What day is it today? Kousei: Didn't I already answer that? It's six days before the new year, and less an a week to go until the festival. Natsume: That was the first question. I'm asking you a different one right now. What day is it today? Kousei: Christmas? Kousei: But... Natsume: It's not a trick question. Kousei: It's too easy, though. There's gotta be a catch. Natsume: Is that your final answer? Kousei: Sure. The answer is Christmas. Natsume: Bingo. You're correct. Natsume: Didn't I tell you earlier that I had something to give you? Kousei: Yeah, but I thought you meant the meat bun. Natsume: I never said that. Kousei: True. That was only an assumption on my part. Kousei: But I kinda wish you'd stop screwing with me for no reason. Natsume: You should've seen the look of surprise on your face, though. Pfft. It was hilarious. Kousei: Oh, is that so? Well, I'm glad that you find my face so amusing. Natsume: Oh, stop sulking. It's not a joke present, I promise. Kousei: Th-Thanks. Kousei: But I don't have anything to give you. Natsume: That's fine. I wasn't expecting anything in return. Natsume: Just think of it as a token of appreciation. For the takoyaki party, and the hard work you've been putting in day after day. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Sorry, but I'd just feel too bad taking this without giving you anything. Kousei: Hold on for a bit. I'm gonna go buy you something right now. Kousei: I won't be long, I promise! Let's see... thirty minutes. I'll be back in thirty minutes. Natsume: --closed. *sigh*... Listen to me, will you? I said I didn't need a present... Natsume: Now you're the one getting my hopes up... Tch. Kousei: *pant* *pant*... Kousei: Hrmmmm. Kousei: Oh, I know! There might be some shops at the station still open for a little longer. Kousei: Err, so about the present. Kousei: I'm really sorry. I tried looking, but everywhere was closed. Natsume: Don't worry about it. Like I said, this is mostly just a token of appreciation. Kousei: I mean, I actually did buy you something. Kousei: But since most places were closed, I didn't have a wide selection to choose from. Before you say anything, I just wanted to let you know: I didn't buy this on account of my own personal tastes. Natsume: What, is it some kind of cosplay thing? Kousei: No. Definitely not. Kousei: Yeah, that'd be a bit too cringy, even for me. Kousei: But I'm not too confident you'll like it either, so I'd appreciate it if you could open it after I leave. Kousei: If I see you frown after taking a look at it, I'm not sure I'll be able to take it. Natsume: I'd never do something that rude, but fine. I'll open it later. Kousei: ...... Kousei: ...... Kousei: I feel kinda bad now. Compared to this scarf, the present I bought her seems mediocre. Kousei: But I already gave it to her, so it's too late now. Kousei: I suppose I could try giving her another present tomorrow... but she probably wouldn't accept it. Kousei: Maybe I should've picked something else, after all? Natsume: Tch. I hate to admit it, but I might actually use this. Natsume: ...... Natsume: I really hate to admit how much I like it. "

I dragged him along, really. He's been asking me to try out this new tea place that just opened up nearby, but honestly, who needs tea when you can have coffee? Anyway, we ended up at this quiet little park where he could sit and strum his piano while I supervised from a distance... or rather, complained about the noise level.",

He'd been working on some music and wanted to practice outside, away from distractions. As his friend, I figured it was no big deal to tag along and keep him company. We found a nice spot under the cherry blossoms, and he started playing this beautiful piece on his piano. It was... *ahem* lovely, really. Don't get any ideas; we just sat there listening to music and chatting. No romance involved, got it?",

            "Kousei: Kanna? What's wrong? Is there some kind of problem outside? Kanna: No, nothing of that nature. I just had something I wanted to talk about... Suzune: Alright, alright. Go ahead. We're not that busy right now, so go ahead and take your break. Kousei: Thanks. Kousei: So, what's going on? Kanna: Actually, it's about Mikado-san. He asked me for a favor, you see. Kousei: A favor? That's unusual, coming from him. Kanna: Yeah. He says he wants me to assist him with his Grim Reaper duties. Kousei: You mean guiding the souls of the dead, and collecting butterflies? Kanna: Right. Especially with regards to this cafe. He says it would be easier than trying to employ a new Grim Reaper. Kanna: And as a former Grim Reaper, I'm something of a successful example of a reincarnated soul myself. So he wants me to help in that regard too. Kanna: But also... I feel like I'm obligated to do this, in return for the power I used up from all those souls. Kousei: ...... Kanna: No, of course not. Kanna: If that was the case, I would've already told him no. Kousei: Alright... I have nothing against it then. Kousei: But if there's nothing to worry about, then why'd you need to come talk to me about it? Kanna: Well, if I agree to do this, we might wind up having less time to spend together. Kanna: So rather than making a decision on my own, I thought it'd be best to consult you first. Kousei: It sounds like you want to do it. Kanna: I do. I think it would be wonderful if my experiences could help lead other butterflies to happiness as well. Kousei: Well, I've still got a ways to go before I've paid off my debts too. I think it's a great idea. Kousei: But wait... are humans able to use that Reaper's scythe of yours too? Kanna: I had no idea about that either, but apparently what matters most is the wielder themselves, rather than if they're human or Grim Reaper. Kousei: Oh, really? Kousei: What about that getup of yours? Wasn't that part of your set? Kanna: It wasn't absolutely necessary or anything. I could wield my scythe wearing this waitress uniform too, if I wanted. Kousei: Hmm... okay. Kousei: You're definitely seeing things. Kanna: Oh, fine. But anyway, I want to talk about the promise we made yesterday. Kousei: I haven't forgotten... I'll talk to him, I promise. I tried calling, you know, but he didn't pick up. Kousei: I left him a voicemail too, but he hasn't returned my call yet. Kanna: ...... Kousei: Seriously, I did. I'm not lying. Kanna: I know. Nihihi. I'm glad you worked up the courage to do it. Kanna: That means a lot to me. Kanna: You love lap pillows, don't you? Kousei: Correction: Kousei: I love YOUR lap pillow. Kanna: Good answer. Kousei: I'm not too heavy, am I? Kanna: Of course you're heavy. You're a very cumbersome person, Kousei-san. Kousei: Huh? Are you talking about my weight, or my personality? Kanna: Hmm. I wonder? Nihihi. Kanna: But don't worry. I love supporting the person I love too. Kousei: Thank you, Kanna. Kousei: By the way... is this lap pillow supposed to be the reward we agreed on? Kanna: It is. Kousei: Oh... Kanna: Don't worry. This is just your reward for calling him. Depending on how things go, though... I might have something else for you later on. Kousei: Oh, that sounds exciting. Kanna: I'm just as excited for it as you are. Kanna: Yes? Kousei: When I do get to talk to my dad... will you be there with me? Kanna: What a silly thing to ask. We promised to always be together, didn't we? Kousei: Yeah... Thanks. Kousei: Yeah. Let's go. Kousei: What? Kanna: There's just something about walking home with you that makes me happy. Kanna: Oh, what am I saying... Of course it makes me happy, going back to our apartment after a hard day's work. Kousei: Same. Going home with you makes me happy too. Kousei: Yeah, it is. Kanna: I hope it warms up soon. Kousei: You do? I kind of like the cold. Kanna: Let me guess: you're going to say, \"Because it gives us an excuse to snuggle up to one another!\" Kanna: But think about it more carefully, Kousei-san. Kousei: What do you mean? Kanna: Once it gets warmer, we won't have to dress in so many layers... Which means we'll be able to feel each other's skin directly. Kousei: ...... Kousei: You know what? You're right. I can't wait for spring. Kanna: You're the easiest person to read. Kousei: That's not the only reason I can't wait, though. Kousei: Seeing cherry blossoms bloom in the spring, going to the beach in the summer, watching the leaves change color in the fall... There are so many things I can't wait to do with you, Kanna. Kanna: I know. I can't wait either! Kousei: Phew... It's cold in here. Let me turn on the heat. And the kotatsu too. Kanna: Should I warm the bath for you too? Or would you like to have dinner first? Or perhaps you'd like to have... me? Kousei: Listen... I just got home from work, alright? If you think I have the energy for that right now... Kousei: Then you're damn right! Kanna: Ahhh! Just kidding. Kousei: Kanna... Kanna: What? Wait, you're serious? Right now? Weren't we just joking around? Kousei: Huh? You were joking? Kanna: I mean, I was just doing the whole newlywed bit... We haven't even had dinner yet... Kousei: It'd be tough for us to do any strenuous physical activity on a full stomach, though. Kanna: But we haven't even bathed yet either... Kousei: Considering how sweaty we're going to get, it's probably better we do it after anyway. Kanna: Ah... Kousei: What? Kanna: Your phone's ringing. Kousei: I don't care. You're more important to me right now. Kanna: That's sweet of you, but you should really pick it up. Kanna: It's extremely rare for anybody to call you, so it has to be something important. Kousei: Hey! I admit, I don't have many friends, but aren't you being a little rude?! Kanna: But given the timing of this call, it has to be-- Kousei: I know. Kazufumi: \"Hey, Kousei. Are you free to talk right now?\" Kousei: Yeah. Did you get my voicemail? Kazufumi: \"You said you had something important you wanted to talk to me about?\" Kousei: Kind of. Kousei: Wait, no. I don't mean it's \"kind of\" important. It's very important. Don't get me wrong, I-- Kazufumi: \"Whoa, slow down. What's with you? You sound nervous.\" Kazufumi: \"Is it really something that important?\" Kousei: Yeah. So I'd prefer to talk to you about it in person, rather than over the phone. Do you think you'll be back in Japan anytime soon? Kazufumi: \"......\" Kazufumi: \"This is the first time you've ever asked me that.\" Kousei: Yeah. It feels a little weird for me too. Kousei: Er, no offense. Kazufumi: \"I know. Alright, I'll fly back the day after tomorrow.\" Kousei: Seriously? You can just come back on such short notice? Kazufumi: \"Well, you said it was important.\" Kousei: You're not cutting work short because of me, are you? You really don't have to do that! It's important... but it's not an emergency or anything. Kousei: It can wait until you're finished with your current job. Kazufumi: \"You sure you're okay with that?\" Kousei: Yeah. That's no problem. Kazufumi: \"Hmm... Still, I'm curious as to what this is all about. I can't even begin to imagine.\" Kazufumi: \"Is it good news or bad news? Can you at least tell me that much over the phone?\" Kousei: It's... good news. At least, it is for me. Kousei: There's someone I want you to introduce you to... Someone I want you to meet. Kousei: Nh... Nhh... Kousei: ...... Kousei: Ahmph, *suck* *suck*... Kanna: Ah... Nh... Nhh, ah... Nhh... Kousei: Maybe that's why I feel so compelled to suck on them... To figure out the true identity of this feeling. Kanna: There you go, talking like some lunatic again. Kousei: Maybe titty-sucking goblins are just philosophers by nature. Kanna: It really can't be that deep. Kousei: Hey, I'm not doing this just because I'm horny, okay? Kanna: ...... Kousei: No, seriously. Kousei: Today's the day my dad's coming back. Kousei: So I need a bit of a boost, a bit of courage... You know, something to cheer me up. Kanna: And my nipples do that for you? Kousei: Yeah. At least, I think so. Kanna: You don't even know? Kanna: *sigh*... Oh, alright. Fine. Kousei: Really? I can? Kanna: Well, I am the one who asked you to talk to Kazufumi-san. If my tits can help you in some way... then they're all yours. Kousei: Don't mind if I do. Kousei: Ahmph... Mhh, *suck* *suck*... *slurp* *smooch*... *lick* *lick*... Mhh... Kanna: H-Hey, slow down... Nh, nhh! Ahhh... Kanna: Th-This is only to help cheer you up, remember? It's not... supposed to be sexual... Kousei: I know. Relax, I don't have any ulterior motives. *lick* *lick* *lick* *lick* Kanna: Well, if you say so... Ahh! Still, you're being really rough... Ahhh, nhh... Ah, ah... Ahhh... Kanna: Ahhhhhh... Hnghhh! Kanna: You really are a titty-sucking goblin. Kousei: Oh, come on. You gave me permission. Kanna: Only because you said it would help cheer you up. But the way you were licking me was so naughty... Mrgh... Kousei: Seeing you shiver and moan with pleasure certainly did help cheer me up. Kanna: You're definitely just saying that as an afterthought. Kousei: Alright, I was kidding. But it really did cheer me up. Kousei: I feel like I'm ready to talk to my dad face-to-face now. About the one thing I've always wondered. Kousei: When the time comes, I want you to be there with me. Kanna: Don't worry. I'll always be with you. Kousei: Thanks. Kousei: Before that, though, I've gotta get to work. Kousei: I'll see you later. Kanna: Okay. See you in a bit. Kazufumi: ...... Nozomi: Welcome to Cafe Stella! Kazufumi: Hey there, Nozomi-chan. Nozomi: Oh? Kazufumi-san! I didn't know you were back in Japan! Kazufumi: Just arrived, actually. Kousei said he had something to discuss with me, you see. Nozomi: He did? Hmm... Should I go get him? He's still working right now, though. Kazufumi: That's okay. I don't need to talk to him right this minute. Kazufumi: I just came by to see how this cafe's changed since the last time I visited. Nozomi: Oh, okay. Well, you're more than welcome. Please, follow me to your seat. Kazufumi: Ah--before that, though. Would you mind doing me a small favor? Nozomi: Okay? Kousei: Here. Give this a check for me. Suzune: Hmm... Alright. It's cooked through. Go ahead and add the finishing touches. Kousei: Okay. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Pancakes for table three are ready! Mei: I'll take that out! Natsume: I need a Japanese-style pasta and a soft-cooked omelet rice, please. Kousei: Gotcha. Suzune: Can you do the pasta? I'll handle the omelet rice. Kousei: Sure. Suzune: I probably don't need to tell you this, but-- Kousei: I know. I'll have it ready when yours is. Suzune: Good. Let's get to it. Kousei: Aye aye. Kazufumi: I've never seen him like this. Nozomi: Well, it's not often you get to see him on the job. Kazufumi: Is he always like this when he's working? Nozomi: Pretty much, yeah. Nozomi: Normally he's kind of a slacker, but he gives it 110\\% when at he's at work. Kazufumi: He certainly does seem to be working hard... but he looks like he's enjoying himself too. Kazufumi: I can't say he's ever shown me this side of him before. Nozomi: But it's thanks to you that Kousei-kun is able to work like this in the first place. Kazufumi: What I did didn't amount to much. I can't take much credit. Kazufumi: The main reason this cafe is so popular is because of all the hard work you and Kousei put in. Nozomi: But you played a big part in it too, Kazufumi-san. Everyone loves how cute these uniforms you gave us are. Ehehe. Nozomi: Honestly, I think you can take a bit more credit. Dad told me about what happened last time. Kazufumi: Rokurou did? What'd he tell you? Nozomi: He said that when Kousei-kun called you for help last time, you dropped everything you were working on and flew straight back to Japan. Kazufumi: ...... Nozomi: You said it was because you had a job here, but he told me that wasn't quite true either. You were doing everything you could to stay in Japan until the cafe had gotten on its feet, weren't you? Nozomi: I also heard you were quite pushy when calling in a favor for these uniforms. Kazufumi: Damn that guy. Always the meddler... *sigh* Kazufumi: He hasn't told you about, er... anything else, has he? Nozomi: I've heard a few stories. Kazufumi: And... have you told Kousei about these \"stories\"? Nozomi: Nope. Kazufumi: Well, that's a relief. Nozomi: If only you two could learn how to be honest with your feelings. Kazufumi: ...... Kazufumi: Well, thanks, Nozomi-chan. I think I've seen enough for now. Kazufumi: Now then, I should probably order something... How about that new omelette alla carbonara that Kousei's been cooking up? Nozomi: Sure thing! Kousei: Hngh... I'm beat... Suzune: Good job hanging in there. Kousei: You too. It's been less than a week, but I'm glad that business is already back to normal. Suzune: Yep. Winter break's over now. Suzune: Speaking of school: aren't your exams starting next month? Kousei: Yeah... I'd better start studying soon. Nozomi: Kousei-kun! Kousei: Hey, Nozomi. Nozomi: Kazufumi-san's here to see you. Kousei: Huh? Really? Kazufumi: Hey. Long time no see. Kousei: Yeah... It's been a while. Kousei: I thought you were gonna come stop by the apartment. Kazufumi: I promised I'd pay the cafe another visit last time, didn't I? Kazufumi: I even had a plate of that omelette alla carbonara you made. Kousei: You did?! I thought you just got here. Kazufumi: Actually, I've been here for a while now, soaking it all in. I have to say, I think the cafe's improved dramatically. Kazufumi: And the food was delicious. Kousei: ...... Kazufumi: You've done a good job. Kousei: O-Oh... thanks. Kazufumi: So, I believe you had something you wanted to talk about. Kazufumi: You went through the trouble of calling me too. But since it's something important... I suppose you'd rather we talk at the apartment? Kousei: Yeah. Would you mind going back to the apartment first? I'll join you after I finish cleaning up here. Kazufumi: Alright. "

I thought I'd gotten it down for sure this time! Kazufumi: I'm sick of this. Kazufumi: I eat the same thing over and over again! I wanna eat something else! Kousei: Don't be like that.

Kazufumi: No, I'm not. Have some faith in your old man. Nozomi: We wouldn't be lying to you this late in the game, Kousei-kun. Kousei: O-Okay. Thanks. Nozomi: But don't get too cocky. Nozomi: It's much better compared to your first attempt, but you still got a long way to go. Kousei: I know. I'm not going to stop practicing. Kousei: But, uh... I suppose I could cook something different for a change, next time. Kazufumi: I knew it. You're sick of omelet rice too, aren't you? Kousei: Well, of course I am. I've eaten it dozens of times now. Kousei: But thank God I've gotten better at making it now. Nozomi: I have to say, though... it feels a little strange to eat your cooking every day, Kousei-kun. *giggle* Kousei: I appreciate the help, really. I promise I'll make it up to you as an apology--or as thanks, rather. Kousei: I'll buy you a more mature pair of panties like you said you wanted. Two pairs, in fact. Nozomi: You're the one who said that, not me! And I definitely didn't ask you to buy them for me either! Kazufumi: Oh--and speaking of which, I almost forgot the most important thing. I finally got a call from my friend yesterday. Kazufumi: He says they're all ready to go. Mei: These are the new uniforms?! They're sooo cuuute! Oh my God! Mei: Can I really wear this? Are you sure? Kousei: Well, that's what they're for. In fact, I'd be pretty sad if you DIDN'T wear them. Mei: But it's almost TOO cute... I'm a little embarrassed, actually... I'm worried it won't look good on me. Nozomi: Of course it will, Mei-chan. Kousei: Well, the designer put a lot of effort into them, so I hope you wear them. Natsume: Alright. Then let's go try them on. Kanna: Yeah, we have to make sure they fit properly. Natsume: That means you girls too. Enough admiring your outfits. We've got to actually put them on. Nozomi & Mei: Okay! Nozomi: But for a cafe uniform, we probably want something that's eye-catching. Mei: Y-Yeah, probably. Mei: *sigh*... Still, um, something doesn't sit quite right with me. Kousei: Is there some part you don't like? Mei: A-Absolutely not! Honestly, it's perfect! Mei: But it's just so cute that... I'm not really sure I should be wearing it. It doesn't look too weird on me... does it? Mei: This is really embarrassing... Ahhhhh... Kousei: Why are you embarrassed? You look super cute. Nozomi: Totally! You don't have anything to be nervous about. I guarantee it. Nozomi: If anything, I'm the one who should be worried. I may have, um, gained a few pounds since I last weighed myself. Just a few. Mei: I honestly can't tell one bit... Nozomi: Only 'cause the clothes are hiding it. Mei: Really? Nozomi: Ahh?! M-Mei-chan?! Mei: Hmm... Nothing feels unusual to me. Mei: In fact, all this pudginess only makes you more huggable! Nozomi: Pudgy?! That's even more insulting! Mei: What? It's a compliment. Mei: I wuv you, Nozomi-chan! Nozomi: Ahaha! That tickles, Mei-chan! Kousei: ...... Mei: Huh? Ah, ahhhh?! Nghhhhh... N-Nozomi-chan! Not there! Mh, mhh! Mei: I'm really ticklish there, so--! Ahh! Eeek! Nozomi: This is what you get for messing with me all the time! Heehee! Mei: Ahh! Nghhh... Ah, ah... Nhh! Nooo, stop tickling me! Kousei: ...... Kanna: Goodness gracious. Look at the way you're gawking at those young girls. You were having dirty thoughts, weren't you? Kousei: It's kind of hard not to in this situation, honestly. Kanna: Wow, I didn't expect such a brazen confession... Although I guess you have a point. Natsume: Why are you agreeing with him? Kanna: Well, he's a young man. He can hardly help it. Kanna: But please remember that this is a dining establishment, Takamine-san. I'll have to ask you to refrain from any, umm... indecent behavior. Kousei: Such as? Kanna: Masturbating. Natsume: Wha--?! Kousei: You don't miss a beat, do you?! Kanna: Aww, were you expecting me to get all embarrassed and blush? Boy, oh boy... This is exactly why you're still a virgin. Kanna: Nobody wants a guy who acts like some childish grade-schooler. I think you should work on changing that. Kousei: I mean... I just didn't expect you to say it so nonchalantly. Kousei: And why are you the one blushing, Shiki-san? Natsume: Shut up, you moron. Natsume: The real question is, how is Akizuki-san so calm about this? You were blushing so much the last time you talked about taking his virginity. Kanna: W-Well, there's an obvious reason for that. Taking his virginity is something that I'd have to do, hypothetically. Kanna: But masturbating is something he does on his own, so it doesn't concern me one bit. Natsume: I'm not sure why that's where you draw the line. I feel like talking about m-mastur--is more embarrassing, if you ask me... Kanna: Well, if we were talking about me doing the m-mastur--then, of course, I'd be a bit embarrassed. Natsume: Stop mocking me, will you?! Natsume: *sigh*... Can we please get back on topic? We need to talk about the uniforms. Natsume: Don't you think the skirts are a little too short? My legs are completely exposed. Kanna: What's wrong with that? You have very beautiful legs, Natsume-san. Kanna: If anything, you should show them off even more! Strut your stuff! Natsume: I don't know about that... It's already short enough as is. Natsume: But I guess I can't be the only one wearing the old one... Plus I'm the one who greenlit the redesign. Kanna: I don't think anyone would mind if you wore the old one from time to time. Though, you really do look attractive, and I mean it. Kanna: Case in point, Takamine-san's eyes have been glued on you this whole time. Natsume: Ah?! Kousei: Oh, yeah. I agree. It looks great on you. Kousei: And I'm not just saying that. You're cute, really. Natsume: O-Oh... Well, thanks. Natsume: I thought you were leering at me... but I guess it was just Akizuki-san being misleading again. Kanna: Hey, I wasn't lying. He couldn't take his eyes off you. Kousei: ...... Nozomi: Yeah? What is it? Kousei: Phew... That's better. Plain ole you. Nozomi: I'm not sure what that's supposed to mean... but it kind of pisses me off, for some reason. Kousei: Sorry. What I meant to say was--you look cute. You give off a different vibe in those clothes. Nozomi: Huh? Really? Kousei: Yeah. You look even more innocent and child-like. Nozomi: That's not a compliment! Kousei: It is, I swear. Relax, it looks great on you. Kousei: I'm sure glad I asked you to work here. Nozomi: Hmph. Fine. Mei: Don't worry, Nozomi-chan. You look adorable! I guarantee it. Nozomi: Thanks, Mei-chan! Ehehe. Mei: Why don't we take a picture to celebrate the occasion? Kanna: ...... Kousei: ...... Kanna: ...... Kousei: Anyway-- Kanna: What?! I don't get anything?! Kanna: It kind of hurts being the only one who doesn't get a compliment or anything... Kanna: Sure, given your personality, you only know how to give out bland, cliched compliments... but something would have been better than nothing. Kousei: Hey, don't call them bland! Now I can't think of anything to say! Kousei: I mean, you look cute... of course. The outfit suits you perfectly. Kousei: A-Also... the way you have your hair tied up looks... kind of nice. Kousei: Gaaah! My compliments really do suck! But it's what I really think, so what am I supposed to do about it?! Kanna: I wasn't complaining. Kanna: As long as your compliments come from the heart, I appreciate them. Thank you very much. Nihihi. Kousei: Y-You're welcome... Natsume: Thank you, Takamine-kun. And if you need us to pay for the uniforms, I-- Kousei: It's already been taken care of, I'm told. Kousei: My dad and his friend go way back, so this was a special favor for him. Kousei: Besides, these aren't fully-new designs either. Apparently he recycled some old, unused designs to make them. Kousei: So yeah, he said we don't need to worry about paying. Kousei: Instead, he just wants us to avoid using these clothing designs for promotional purposes. Natsume: Alright. Natsume: I really appreciate it. I'd like to thank your dad too, if I could... Kousei: I'm sure he'll drop by one of these days. Natsume: Then I'll be sure to thank him then. Kanna: But to do that, we have to get the point where we can welcome him here as a customer. Mei: Hey, Senpai! Would you mind pretending to be a customer? Kousei: For what? Mei: Since we've already changed into our uniforms, it'd be a shame to take 'em off so soon. Mei: So I think this is the perfect opportunity to practice a few customer-service situations. Kousei: Hmm... Alright. Kousei: Now that you mention it, I've been so busy with cooking practice that I haven't checked up on you guys at all. Mei: I've tasted your cooking, Senpai, so I've seen the progress you're making--but you haven't seen ours yet. Mei: Plus, I think having a new person to rehearse with would be good practice for us. Kousei: Sure. I'm all for it. Mei: Are you fine with a counter seat? Wonderful! Please follow me. Mei: Call out to me once you've decided on your order. Mei: Thank you for waiting. What can I get for you today? One black tea? Certainly. I'll have that out to you shortly. Kousei: Hmm. Mei: How was that? Did I do a good job? Kousei: Yeah, I thought it was pretty good. Kousei: You were cheerful, polite, and your energy even felt infectious. Mei: I appreciate it and all... but I wasn't too annoying, was I? Kousei: Nope. Not at all. Kousei: You're bubbly, and I think that's a good thing. Kousei: Although... you probably don't want to raise your voice any more than that. Mei: I'll keep that in mind. Kousei: Well, you don't need to go softer or anything. You had it at a good level. Mei: Thank you very much. Mei: Now then, I'll be right back with your tea. Don't worry, I've been practicing how to make a proper brew. It's even gotten Natsume-senpai's seal of approval! Kousei: Oh, wow. I can't wait to try it. Mei: I won't let you down! Oops, let me try that again. Mei: Yes, sir. I'll have it out to you shortly. Mei: Was that good? Ahaha! Kousei: Oh, and could you bring a second cup as well? Mei: Certainly. Would you like the same, or a different brew? Kousei: Well, the drink is for you, so whatever you want. Mei: It's for me? Kousei: We're going to be coworkers, but I realized I don't actually know much about you. Kousei: So I was thinking we could chat a bit over a cup of tea, if you don't mind... Mei: Are you hitting on me? You are, aren't you? Oh gosh... I've never been hit on before. Kousei: I'm not. At least, I'm not trying to. Kousei: But now that you mentioned that, I'm getting nervous. My heart's starting to pound. Mei: Is it? I thought you were a college student, though. Mei: Isn't college life all about drinking, parties, doing drugs, one-night stands, and general debauchery? Kousei: Look, colleges are places for learning. A student's main focus is their studies. Most of us attend class and take our academics very seriously, okay? Mei: I kind of get the feeling you aren't one of those, though. Kousei: Okay, you got me! Mei: Ahaha! You're a lot funnier than I thought, Senpai. Mei: Alright. I'll allow you to hit on me! Two black teas, coming right up! Kousei: Thanks. Mei: My pleasure! Nozomi: Thank you for waiting! Here's your blend coffee. Nozomi: What? That's not what you ordered? I'm so sorry. Nozomi: I'll get this fixed right away. I appreciate your patience in the meantime. Nozomi: Thank you very much. I'll be back with what you ordered as soon as I can. And again, I'm very sorry about this. Kousei: ...... Nozomi: Don't just sit there. Say something, geez! Kousei: Sorry. It's just kinda strange hearing you talk to me so politely. Nozomi: I know what you mean. It's super uncomfortable having to speak politely to a chump like you. Kousei: Wow. Who are you calling a chump? Nozomi: Come on, what's the big deal? Ehehe. Kousei: Well, in any case, you did fine. Kousei: Not that I was ever worried about you in the first place. Nozomi: I'm glad I didn't let you down then. Nozomi: But, uhh, maybe that's only because I'm practicing with you, Kousei-kun. I might get really nervous when dealing with a real customer. Kousei: You can do it, Nozomi. I completely believe in you. Nozomi: ...... Nozomi: Said the aspiring gigolo. Kanna: If there's anything else I can do for you, please don't hesitate to let me know. Kanna: Enjoy your drink, sir. Kanna: Now if you'll excuse me. Kousei: That was perfect, actually. Kanna: Really? I'm still a little nervous, to be honest. Kousei: Could've fooled me... Kousei: You did great. I might not be an expert on etiquette... but I'd say you pretty much nailed it. Kanna: Thank you very much. Nihihi. Kousei: That's kind of unnerving. Kanna: What is? Kousei: The way you go from snickering mischievously to smiling innocently at the drop of a hat when serving customers. Kanna: Well, that's just how we girls work. Nihihi! Natsume: Have a good day, and come visit us again sometime! Kousei: ...... Kousei: Well then. Mei: There's nothing wrong with her manners, at least. Kousei: I'm starting to think this customer service business might be harder than it looks. Natsume: ...... Kousei: Why are you glaring at me? Nozomi: T-To be honest, Natsume-san... Your smile does feel... a little stiff. Kanna: It's a shame you can't smile more naturally after all that practice. Kousei: She hasn't improved at all? Natsume: I-I have, I swear! It's just because of this new waitress uniform! Natsume: I've never practiced in a short skirt that shows off my bare legs! Natsume: That's the only reason I can't seem to smile right. Kanna: Still, we can't have you smiling like this around customers. Natsume: I-I know. I'll practice until I get it right. Kousei: Well, I'm not in any position to judge you. My cooking still needs a lot of work. Also, as for the cafe renovations, I almost forgot to mention. Kousei: My dad gave us permission to decorate the store with a few of his paintings, if we want. Natsume: What? I appreciate the offer, but, like, I thought your father was a famous artist. Aren't his paintings fairly valuable? Mei: Wow... a professional work of art? I bet that's not going to come cheap. Kousei: Oh, no. We can decorate this place with as many as we like, free of charge. Mei: What?! For real?! Kousei: Yep. We won't have to spare a single yen! This is a rare, once-in-a-lifetime deal that you won't want to miss out on, so call now! Natsume: What is this, some kind of infomercial? Mei: Ahaha, sorry. I was just doing a bit. Kousei: And I just thought I'd play along. Kousei: But I'm serious; we don't need to pay. My dad's not selling the paintings to us, per se, he's just kind of storing them here, if that makes sense. Kousei: And besides, he's got tons of paintings that he isn't planning to sell. Nozomi: Now that you mention it, your old house is full of his paintings, isn't it? Kousei: Yeah. All we're doing is dusting off a few of those old canvases and putting them on display, mostly for safekeeping. Kousei: My dad already agreed to it, so there's nothing to worry about. Natsume: Alright. I guess we'll take them. Mei: Let me know if there's anything I can do to help. I'm ready to be put to work! Nozomi: You're super enthusiastic, aren't you? Mei: Am I? Maybe it's these cute new uniforms. Mei: Wearing it makes all the progress we're making feel real... It gets me super pumped up! Nozomi: Ohh, I know what you mean. It's like buying a new kitchen tool or something--you wanna give it a whirl right away! Mei: Yeah! Kousei: Hmm. In that case--Hiuchidani-san, could you assist Shiki-san with her training and teach her how to smile? Natsume: I would really appreciate your help, Hiuchidani-san. Mei: Oh, stop. Don't bow your head like that. You're being way too dramatic. Ahaha. Mei: Don't forget that I'm an employee at this cafe too. Of course I'd be happy to help. Natsume: Thanks. Kanna: I like the team spirit we've got going on here. Kousei: Yeah. "

Suzune: After all, we gotta have some pictures to accompany the announcement. Kousei: Okay, I get that. But why did you want to come up to my room again? Suzune: Do I... really have to say it? Kousei: Let me guess: you can't finish eating it yourself. Suzune: Ding, ding, ding! Correct. Kousei: Man, why'd you have to make it sound so suggestive? You led me on there. Suzune: Aww, did I get your heart racing? Kousei: Well, maybe a little. Suzune: Perfect. That's what you get for teasing me that one time! Hehehe. Kousei: You still haven't gotten over that? Suzune: Well, it's true that I can't finish this all by myself. Also, I wanted to hear your impressions. So go ahead, dig in! Kousei: I already know it's delicious just by the fact that you made it, Suzune-san. Suzune: Well, duh. I wanted to have you try it, so I obviously made sure it was up to scratch first. Suzune: But still, getting that validation of someone eating it and saying they like it is always good. Suzune: Those compliments are what give me the confidence to keep going. You know what I mean? Kousei: Yeah. Suzune: Be my guest. Suzune: Yep. A bit of sour goes a long way in bringing out the sweet, don't you think? Kousei: Yeah. Mhh. It tastes great. Suzune: Glad to hear it. Ehehe. Suzune: I'm also thinking about offering a couple variations, like ones with powdered sugar to powdered cocoa or powdered coffee. Kousei: Think you'll have enough time for all that? Suzune: It'll be a lot of work, but it shouldn't be impossible. As long as people place their orders ahead of time. But yeah, it'll be a real pain in the ass... Kousei: Well, if you can manage it, I think it's a good idea. The more variety, the better. Suzune: Thanks. Suzune: *gulp* *gulp*... Ahhh! Nothin' like a cold beer after a big success! No, sir! Kousei: C'mon, don't just sit there and drink. Help me eat this. Kousei: There's no way in hell I'm finishing this on my own. Suzune: I know. Suzune: Oh-ho. That look on your face tells me you're having dirty thoughts. You naughty boy, you. Kousei: A young man and woman. Alone together. In a locked room. There's only one thing that happens in a situation like this... Suzune: I'm gonna have to stop you right there. Suzune: If I don't make it back to my apartment, I'll leak your most embarrassing secrets to the whole wide world. Kousei: Relax, I'm kidding. I'd never try something like that. Suzune: Whaddaya mean \"never\"? You sayin' I ain't good enough for you, punk? Kousei: Of course I didn't mean it in an offensive way. I'm nothing if not a gentleman. Suzune: Oh, are you now? Kousei: For a gentleman like myself, a woman's attractiveness isn't determined solely by the size of her breasts! Suzune: You ARE makin' fun of me, you little shit! Suzune: Fine. As punishment, I'm going to figure out your preferences in women. Suzune: Guys all hide their porn mags underneath their beds, don't they? Kousei: No, they don't. And I don't even have any porn mags. Suzune: You liar. All guys your age have at least one or two. Kousei: Nobody buys physical porn these days. As long as you have a phone, you can find whatever you need, whenever. Suzune: Oh, uh-huh. Welp, time to search through your phone! Kousei: Yeah, right. That's not happening. Suzune: So you ARE hiding embarrassing stuff on there. Gimme your hand. I need your fingerprint to unlock it. Kousei: Hey! Haven't you heard of this thing called privacy?! Kousei: Nuh-uh! Kousei: Oof... Suzune: So, um, listen. Kousei: Yes?! Suzune: Sorry. Suzune: I got a little carried away. You were right; I don't have any right to ask you to show me your phone. Kousei: It's fine. Not like you actually saw anything. Kousei: Anyway, you're not hurt, are you? The cafe'd be in hot water if you twisted your hand or something. Suzune: I'm fine. We fell on the bed, so my whole body was pretty much cushioned. Kousei: That's great. Suzune: You good too? Kousei: Yeah, I'm fine. Suzune: Great. Kousei: ...... Suzune: So, um, are you ready to get off me? Kousei: O-Oh, yeah. Sorry. Suzune: ...... Suzune: I did what I came here to do, and I have to wake up early tomorrow too. Kousei: Yeah. Another day of work. Suzune: You'd better get to sleep soon too. I won't accept any excuses if you're late. Kousei: Yeah, I know. I won't be. Suzune: Alright, see you tomorrow. Kousei: See you tomorrow. Good night. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Phew... I really wasn't expecting THAT to happen. Kousei: My heart's still pounding like crazy. She's gone and all, but it still won't settle down. Kousei: Despite what her appearance would have you think, she's definitely an adult. Though if she heard me say that, she'd probably tear my head off. Kousei: Welp, I'd better go take a bath now. Suzune: *sigh*... Suzune: Urk... Suzune: Ahhhhh... Th-That scared the LIFE out of me... Suzune: I got way too carried away just now. I nearly gave away my first kiss by accident! Suzune: I've never been that close to a guy's face before... Suzune: Nghhh! Suzune: B-But he didn't notice how panicked I was, did he? I managed to keep my cool, right? Suzune: Grr... If he knew how embarrassed I was, that little shit would never let me live it down.  Suzune: Just the thought of being teased by a kid Hiroto's age pisses me off. I can't let that happen. Suzune: Well, from the way he acted... I don't think he noticed. Suzune: Maybe that's what happens when you live for your job after getting out into the real world. Suzune: I really should've gotten more experience with these things when I was in school. Suzune: Too late for that now, though. But it's not like I regret it. I'm perfectly happy with where I am these days. Suzune: ...... Suzune: Argh, enough of this crap! Agonizing about it won't change a damned thing! Suzune: I should take a bath. That oughta clear my head... Kousei: Good morning. Suzune: Hey. Suzune: Alright. Time to roll up these sleeves and get to bakin'! Kousei: Aye-aye. Kousei: ...... Suzune: (I thought I got it out of my mind, but now that we're face to face... it's all coming back. I can feel my cheeks getting red.) Suzune: (But if this kid can get back to work like nothing happened, I gotta stop acting so self-conscious. I'm an adult.) Suzune: (I can't let this distract me from my baking either. I need to focus.) Suzune: %123;Let's get this BREAD! Kousei: U-Umm, what was that for? Suzune: Nothing! Don't worry about me; just focus on those cakes. Kousei: O-Okay... Natsume: Time's up. Pencils down. Nozomi & Mei: ...... Natsume: Well done, girls. Natsume: You get a perfect score, Sumizome-san. No mistakes whatsoever. Nozomi: Yes! Mei: Way to go, Nozomi-chan! Nozomi: Aww, thanks! Must be all the extra sleep I've been getting! Natsume: You've still got a few mistakes here and there, Hiuchidani-san, but otherwise, you did very well. Natsume: As long as there aren't any terribly difficult questions on your exam, I think you should be fine. Mei: Thank you very much! I owe it all to you and Kousei-senpai! Kousei: Glad to help. But the real challenge starts tomorrow. Natsume: Don't get complacent just yet. Mei: I promise I won't let the time you've spent tutoring me go to waste! Natsume: You don't have to worry about that. Kousei: Right. Worry about not failing first. Kousei: Don't get too hung up on questions you don't immediately know the answer to. Make sure you have enough time to finish everything. Mei: Got it! Kousei: Lastly, have some faith in all the studying you've been doing and don't stay up cramming tonight. Mei: I won't! I don't want to doze off in the middle of my exams. Kousei: Good. You'll be fine. Natsume: Starting tomorrow, you guys can take a break from work until your exams are over. Natsume: We'll see you again once you're finished. Nozomi: Okay! "

What about you? Taking the advice Suzune-san gave you yesterday? Natsume: Yeah. I was thinking it'd be more practical to use one of these soup stocks instead. Which one seems good to you? Kousei: Why not this one? It's a famous brand that everyone knows. Kousei: The fact that it's been selling for so long has to mean that a lot of people like it, don't you think? Natsume: Well, I guess I'll go with this Chinese soup and this Western-style consomme then. Kousei: Chinese and Western, huh... But what about Japanese-style?

I'm just asking 'cause the person in front of me thought the machine was broken. Her coffee was too bitter or something. Hiroto: Well, it's supposed to be. It's coffee.

It's meant for extracting the richness and fragrance of espressos, but it can come out tasting pretty strong. Hiroto: Hmm, okay. Hiroto: Maybe it just tasted different than what she usually drinks?

Hiroto: Well, I'm the kinda guy who doesn't care as long as it's drinkable. And honestly... people who are too fussy about their coffee piss me off. Kousei: Why's that? Hiroto: My sister used to force me to make her coffee whenever she'd eat cake and stuff, and she'd always be super picky about how I did it... Hiroto: She'd never buy enough cake for me, either. It was slave labor, I tell ya... Hiroto: Anyway, that's how I got into drinking coffee in the first place... But whenever I see someone being super picky about their coffee, I'm reminded of her. Kousei: Ah, okay. Kousei: Out of curiosity, what are your thoughts on girls who need seven sticks of sugar for a small coffee? Hiroto: What? That sounds gross. Seven is just crazy. I doubt I'd be able to date a girl like that. Our tastes would be too different. Hiroto: Not that I've ever had a girlfriend, though. Kousei: Hmm. So that'd be a dealbreaker for you? Kousei: Now what if I told you that girl was Shiki Natsume? Hiroto: Man, girls with a sweet tooth are sooo cute! Seven sticks of sugar? That ain't nothing! I'd fall for a girl like that a hundred percent of the time, man! Kousei: Wow. I've never seen anyone change their tune that quickly before. You sure you don't have whiplash? Hiroto: For a girl as cute as Shiki Natsume? Man, I'd let anything slide. Kousei: True. Kousei: Well, either way, she's way out of our league. Hiroto: I know. This is the Solitary Sniper we're talking about--the girl who shoots down any man who dares get near her. And we're a couple of chickens who've never even flown the coop. Hiroto: *sigh* Reality's just depressing, man. I feel like I'm playing life on insane-mode here... Kousei: Yeah. Wish God would turn down the difficulty or something. Hiroto & Kousei: ...... Kousei: Alright, enough with the pity party. We should probably get going soon. Hiroto: Yeah. Hiroto: Ngh... One more and I can finally go home. Kousei: You got another class after this? Hiroto: Yeah, an elective. I'm trying to free up my schedule next year as much as I can. Kousei: Well, have fun. Hiroto: You already done for the day? Kousei: Yeah. I've been taking the maximum course load ever since freshman year. Hiroto: Really? Why's that? You some kinda eager beaver? Kousei: Nah, I just didn't have any friends here back then. Kousei: So I figured taking more classes would make it easier for me to make friends. And by the time I made friends, I'd have more leeway in my schedule to hang out and do stuff. Hiroto: How'd that pan out? Kousei: Well, I'm on track to graduate by senior year with the credits I've got, at least... Hiroto: I'd hope so! Kousei: What about you? Hiroto: I didn't take a lot of courses back in freshman year. Thought I'd be too busy drinking and partying and socializing and all that. Hiroto: Turns out I had the wrong impression of college life. Hiroto: And now I'm paying the price... It sucks ass, man. I wish I'd taken a bigger load in freshman year like you. Kousei: There's no easy way to catch up, unfortunately. You've just gotta stick it out. Kousei: Not that I've got it easy either. I still need to find a way to earn some money. Hiroto: Yeah, it's a rough world out there. Hiroto: Wish I could help, but I'm a broke-ass college student too. Kousei: Yeah, I know. I'm not asking for donations or anything. I'll get a job and earn it myself. Kousei: Let me know if you hear about any sweet places hiring. Hiroto: Sure thing. Kousei: Alright, well I'll see you tomorrow. Hiroto: Catch ya later, man. "

Kousei: Then can you at least do me a favor and delete those recordings? Nozomi: What? I could never do that. They're precious memories to me. Kousei: You used to be such a sweet, obedient little girl. Kousei: When did you become such a rebellious young girl? You're gonna make Onii-chan cry! Nozomi: If my personality's gone rotten, I think we both know you're to blame. Kousei: Err... I can't exactly deny that. Nozomi: Maybe you should at least try to. Kousei: Well, I know your mom and dad are both good, nice people, so it couldn't be their fault. Nozomi: Nice to you, maybe... All they ever do to me is nag, nag, nag. Kousei: Speaking of that, umm--about those recordings. Nozomi: Yeah, I know. I was just kidding. If the idea of me holding onto those bothers you so much, I'll delete them. And I'll try not to sing those songs anymore, either. Kousei: Seriously? Nozomi: I'm gonna miss those little pieces of our childhood... but I'll be fine! I've already memorized the lyrics anyway. Kousei: Are you kidding me?! Nozomi: Aww, I'm just kidding! Your songs were way too wacky for me to memorize. Kousei: I'm not exactly sure how to feel about that. Nozomi: You're hard to please. Nozomi: Anyway, I'll delete them. Kousei: Thanks. Nozomi: Now, let's hurry up and eat. I'm starving. Kousei: Thanks for the food. Nozomi: Dig in. Nozomi: How's it taste? Kousei: Great. No complaints. Nozomi: Glad you like it. Kousei: I feel kinda bad about making you fix breakfast for me all the time, though... Nozomi: I don't mind. Nozomi: Mom and Dad prefer toast for breakfast, but I like rice, so that creates a bit of a problem. Kousei: Oh, right. Nozomi: Do you ever feel like having toast instead, Kousei-kun? I'm not forcing my preferences on you... am I? Kousei: I would've told you to stop coming if that were the case. Kousei: You make great food, so I've got zero complaints. It's much appreciated. Thank you very much. Nozomi: Heh. Keep showering me in praise! Kousei: These rolled omelets are especially good. Nozomi: I meant me, not the food... Nozomi: Well, whatever. I guess I should know better than to expect a guy like you to be able to compliment a girl. Kousei: Excuse you? I'm the most honest, open guy you'll ever find. Remember back when we were kids? I'd always-- Nozomi: Mhh! These salmon fillets are perfect! I nailed the seasoning today! Kousei: Will you listen to me? Nozomi: Oh, right! I almost forgot; Dad wanted me to tell you something. Kousei: Your dad did? Kousei: Wait, don't tell me... Nozomi: Judging from the look on your face, I think you've already figured it out. Kousei: It's about my rent, isn't it? Nozomi: Bingo. Since you chose the correct answer, you get a prize! Your prize is: paying rent! Kousei: Just out of curiosity, how many months has it been? Nozomi: As of today: four months. Kousei: My old man's done it again... Nozomi: Mr. Kazufumi hasn't been in tocuh with you either, Kousei-kun? Kousei: Nope. We don't talk very often in the first place. I haven't the foggiest idea where he is right now or what he's up to... Nozomi: When's that gonna be, though? You still haven't found a new job, have you? Kousei: Err, well, about that, actually. Nozomi: I know. You don't have to say it. Kousei: Wait, I can explain! I really am looking for one! And I didn't quit my job at the convenience store 'cause I wanted to, okay? If my manager wasn't such an asshole... Kousei: I told him a month in advance I'd need time off to study for exams, but what did he do? Schedule me shift after shift, tell me I need to find someone to cover my shifts if I want time off. And he has the gall to lecture ME about responsibility? Nozomi: This is the same guy that accused you of stealing money from the cash register and took it out of your paycheck, right? Nozomi: You've already told me plenty about how crappy it was there. Kousei: Right. Nozomi: And you've been looking for a new job ever since, but haven't been able to find one. Kousei: Yeah... Nozomi: You're a worthless bum, aint'cha? Kousei: I know... And don't forget to add \"waste-of-space\" and \"good-for-nothing\" to the list too. Nozomi: Seriously, though. What're you gonna do? Nozomi: What? Kousei: Wanna get married? Nozomi: Kousei-kun... I don't know how to respond to that. Marriage is a big deal, you know? Why are you bringing this up so randomly... Kousei: I want to drink your miso soup every morning... Nozomi: You basically already do. Kousei: But I wanna be a lazy bastard who does nothing all day long. I want to marry into money so you can support my lifestyle... Pretty please? Nozomi: You're being way too bold with this proposal... My heart's gonna skip a beat... Kousei: I'll work hard. I'll be the best gigolo the world's ever seen, I promise... So will you take me, Nozomi? Nozomi: Oh, gosh... No one's ever confessed to me before... And to be a gigolo, of all things... Nozomi: Well, I'll ask Mom what she thinks about it first. Kousei: Wait, hold up. Don't do that, please? I don't want her getting the wrong idea. Nozomi: All joking aside--you're not actually planning on becoming a gigolo, are you? That's kind of gross, you know... Kousei: No, I'm not. I'll work to support myself. Nozomi: Well, good. Kousei: I promise I'll pay the rent; I just need some time. Again, I'm really sorry about this. Nozomi: Relax, I was just playing along with the joke. I don't think Dad's that worried about the rent. He knows your dad will pay once he gets ahold of him. Nozomi: What I'm worried about is your lifestyle, though. Are you able to eat enough without any income? Kousei: Yeah, I am. Nozomi: He says you're welcome to stay over anytime. Kousei: Thanks... I'll take him up on that if I run out of options. Nozomi: Still, I think he'd feel a lot better if you dropped by and said hello. Kousei: I will. I'll come by soon and explain things to him. Nozomi: Good. Kousei: Alright. Thanks for breakfast. Nozomi: You're welcome. Nozomi: Don't hesitate to come talk to me if you're having money problems. I know you probably don't feel comfortable asking Dad for help, but I'm always willing to. I have a bit of money saved up myself. Kousei: I can't ask you to lend me money. That's just plain shameless. Nozomi: Oh, really? Didn't you just ask me to marry you so you didn't have to work? Kousei: Come on, you know I was just joking. Kousei: I appreciate the sentiment, but I'm not gonna take your money. Kousei: You already help me out more than enough by cooking me breakfast every day. So thanks for that. Nozomi: Mhm. Kousei: Actually, shouldn't you probably head out soon? Nozomi: Oh, gosh! I didn't know it was this late already. Kousei: I'll take care of the clean up. Nozomi: Really? Thanks. Kousei: No problem. It's the least I can do. Kousei: You already did the work of cooking this. Plus, this is my apartment. Nozomi: Alright. I'm gonna get going then. Nozomi: You need to hear that more than me. Make sure you leave on time, okay? Nozomi: See you later! Kousei: Have fun at school. And watch out for cars. Kousei: Guess I better start getting ready for class. Hiroto: Oh, look who it is! You coming to campus too, Kousei? Kousei: Oh. Hey, Hiroto. Hiroto: Guess you didn't check your email. Professor Komatsu can't come in today, so class is cancelled. Kousei: Seriously? Damn, I rushed on over here for nothing. Hiroto: Maybe. Seems like they wrote it in a hurry this morning. But either way, that means we've got some free time on our hands. Kousei: Yeah. Guess we better find some place to kill some time at. Hiroto: Why don't we chill in the cafeteria for a bit? Kousei: Sounds fine to me. Hiroto: Wanna grab a bite to eat while we're at it? Kousei: They're not open this early, are they? Hiroto: We got that convenience store next door, though. Kousei: Nah, I'm good. I had breakfast before I came. Hiroto: Alright. Guess I'll get myself a coffee then... You want one too? Kousei: If you're paying. Hiroto: Sure, why not? I'm in a good mood today. Kousei: Oh, sweet. I guess I'll take one. Hiroto: Gotcha. Milk and sugar? Kousei: Nope. Make it black. Hiroto: Are you for real, man?! Kousei: *sip*... Phew... Hiroto: ...... Kousei: What? Hiroto: Is that not, like, really bitter? Kousei: Well, of course it is. It's coffee. Hiroto: That doesn't mean you gotta drink it without any sugar or anything. You trying to act sophisticated or something? Kousei: Nah, I just don't really like sugar in my coffee. Makes the acidity more pronounced. Hiroto: Does it? Can't say I've ever noticed. Hiroto: Mind if I take a sip? Kousei: Go ahead. You paid for it. Kousei: What are you doing? Hiroto: Thanks, man. Kousei: No problem. Hiroto: Here's your coffee back. I don't know how the hell you can drink this bitter crap. Kousei: I just don't like really acidic coffee, personally. Hiroto: Different strokes for different folks, I guess. Hiroto: But man, I wasted all my coffee. Maybe I used up all my luck yesterday. Kousei: Come to think of it, you did say you're in a good mood. Kousei: Did you win big at mahjong or something? Hiroto: Hell yeah. In the final round, I managed to turn the game around with a riichi, ippatsu, pinfu, junchan, sanshoku, iipeikou, and triple dora! And you bet your ass I declared riichi there! Kousei: Dang. Hiroto: Interested in mahjong, Kousei? You should play with me sometime. It's fun. Kousei: Sure, when I have the time to. Right now, my top priority is finding a job. Hiroto: Your last job was at that convenience store, right? I remember you telling me about how you quit 'cause of your douchebag manager. Kousei: Do you know any good-paying places that are hiring? And brainless work, preferably. Hiroto: Yeah, right. I'd be working there myself, if I did. Kousei: True. Guess I gotta find one myself the old-fashioned way. Hiroto: Finding something part-time's important, but don't forget we gotta start doing real job hunting next year. Kousei: Yeah... Hiroto: What's your plan? Any particular field you wanna work in? Kousei: No clue. The whole idea of a \"real-world\" job still feels kinda foreign to me. Hiroto: I know what ya mean. I dunno what I wanna do either... Kousei: Well, not like you're gonna get any useful advice out of me. Don't you know someone who's a working adult? Ask them. Hiroto: Huh? Who are you--wait... you aren't talking about my sister, are you? Kousei: What're you grimacing at me for? I thought you were on relatively good terms. Hiroto: I mean, sure, I don't hate her or anything. Hiroto: But she's always bossed me around, stealing my drinks and snacks for about as long as I can remember... Pretty much the last person I'd go to for real help. Kousei: Even though you're siblings? Hiroto: Because we're siblings. I know for a fact she'd just laugh and tease me for it. Hiroto: And it's not like she'd be much help even if she did decide to take me seriously. She's always known what she wanted to do when she grew up. Kousei: She's a pastry chef, isn't she? Hiroto: If she hasn't changed jobs, then yeah. Hiroto: You're probably more up-to-date with her life than me, though, to be honest. Kousei: What? Why would I be? Hiroto: You live in the same apartment complex as her. Heck, I've barely even seen her since she moved out. Kousei: Really? Hiroto: She does come home to visit for New Year's, but that's pretty much it. Hiroto: That time you and I went to say hi, I hadn't seen her in half a year. Kousei: Well, I haven't heard anything about a tenant being found dead, so I guess... Just because we live in the same complex doesn't mean I actually see her. Kousei: Are you concerned about her or something? Hiroto: Not particularly myself... But our mom's a bit worried. Hiroto: Apparently she's been sounding kinda tense over the phone, lately, so she thinks she might be stressed out or something. Kousei: Is that not reason enough for you to check up on her then? Hiroto: Maybe, but I really don't wanna see her. She'll just boss me around like always. Kousei: She seemed like a nice person to me, though. Hiroto: That's just what she wants you to think, man. She's a real tyrant around people she knows. Brash and brazen as hell.  Kousei: Damn, you're savage. Hiroto: Most siblings are that way when they're close in age. Kousei: Well, I'm an only child, so honestly, I'm a little jealous. Hiroto: You shouldn't be. I'd gladly switch places with you. Being bossed around your whole life sucks, I tell you. Hiroto: But anyway, if you see her, do me a favor and let her know our mom's worried about her. Kousei: Sure, I'll try. I think our schedules are pretty different, though, so no guarantees. Hiroto: All good. It's probably nothing serious, honestly. Hiroto: If it were, my mom would've gone over there herself. Kousei: Yeah. Kousei: Well, I hope she's doing alright. Being a working adult must be pretty stressful... Kousei: Speaking of which, weren't you doing an internship somewhere? Hiroto: Yeah, for a bit. What about you? Kousei: I did something similar. Didn't really feel like the right fit for me, though. Hiroto: I know what you mean. Internships are kinda pointless if you don't have a clear idea of what sort of work you wanna do. Kousei: Yeah. Hiroto: *sigh*... If only I could stay in school forever and not have to worry about getting a job. Kousei: Have you thought about going to graduate school? Hiroto: That's not what I'm talking about, man. Kousei: Personally, I just wanna have a nice, normal life... Get a job, make a living, find a girlfriend, get married, have kids, and build a happy family. Hiroto: Yeah, but honestly, even something as \"normal\" as that feels impossible to achieve nowadays. Kousei: I know what you mean... Hiroto: Who's to say we'll even be able to find a decent job? Kousei: Yeah... Hiroto: And forget marriage--I'm not even confident I'll able to get myself a girlfriend... Kousei: That might be more of a challenge than finding a job, honestly. Hiroto: You can say that again. Hiroto: At the very least, I just hope I can lose my virginity before I graduate. Kousei: I remember when I thought I'd lose my virginity before I hit twenty. Those were the days. Hiroto: Same. Hiroto: It just keeps getting further and further away, man. Kousei: I know what you mean. Hiroto: Well, worst case scenario--I can always go into porn. Kousei: Well, damn. Good luck with that. Hiroto: Yeah, thanks. Kousei: C'mon, let's get off this topic. You're killing my mood. Hiroto: Sure thing. Here's to... Actually, nevermind. I don't have any coffee left. Kousei: Yeah, you spilled the whole damn thing. Hiroto: Well, shit... I kinda want some, but not enough to buy another cup. Kousei: I could buy you one. Hiroto: You sure? Kousei: You paid for mine, so it's the least I can do. No biggie. Hiroto: Alright then. Ah--and don't forget to put a bunch of sugar in it, okay? Kousei: Yeah, I will. Hiroto: Oh, and make sure you put the sugar in the cup first before pouring in the coffee. Kousei: Geez. Anything else, Your Highness? Hiroto: Trust me, it tastes better that way. Plus it saves you the work of having to stir it. Kousei: Yeah, okay. Kousei: One small coffee, please. Store Clerk: That'll be 100 yen. Kousei: Here. Store Clerk: Thank you, and have a good day. Kousei: You too. Girl: A small coffee, please. Store Clerk: That'll be 100 yen. Thank you, and have a good day. Girl: Hm? Kousei: Um, you can go ahead. I have to put some sugar in mine first. Girl: Oh, okay. Excuse me. Natsume: Ah! Natsume: I want to ask you something. Natsume: Is it normal for the coffee here to taste super bitter? Kousei: Yeah, I think so. Natsume: Are you sure the machine isn't just broken? It took a while for the liquid to start coming out... Kousei: No, that's normal too. The machine didn't sound like it was acting up, either. Natsume: Oh... Natsume: Well, thanks for the help. Kousei: You're welcome. "

            "Kousei: Morning, everyone. Suzune: Hey. Kanna: Good morning, Takamine-san. Kousei: How are the Yule Logs coming along? Suzune: We're about 80\\% done, I think. Kousei: Is there anything I can help with? Suzune: Wanna start prepping the cheesecakes for me? You remember how to do it, don't you? Kousei: Yeah. Kanna: I'll help out as well. Just tell me what to do. Kousei: Aren't you helping with the Yule Logs, though? Kanna: We've already finished rolling them into log-shapes. All that's left is to add the external decorations, but only Suzune-san is skilled enough to do that. Suzune: I'll be fine. You can go ahead and help him. Kousei: Alright. Mei: Whoa! An actual Yule Log! It looks absolutely scrumptious! Nozomi: Are you finished making them? Suzune: For today, at least. Phew... My shoulders are killing me. Kanna: I'm not surprised. You had to put the finishing touches on all of them. Natsume: Well, they certainly turned out great. Thanks for all your hard work. Kousei: We're not very busy right now, so feel free to take a break if you want, Suzune-san. Suzune: Thanks. I'll take you up on that then. Kanna: Of course. Natsume: Now then, let's get these cakes boxed up. Nozomi & Mei: Okaaay! Mei: Welcome to Cafe Stella! Party of two? If you'd rather not wait, we do have a couple counter seats available right now. Would that be alright? Nozomi: Welcome to Cafe Stella! Ah, you placed an order for two Yule Logs under the name Ota? I'll have them ready for you in just a moment. Natsume: Two pancakes, a blend coffee, and a Guatemalan coffee? I'll have those right out to you. Natsume: Two coffees; house blend and Guatemalan, please. Mikado: Coming right up. Kanna: Oh, Natsume-san! I need to go fetch some more Yule Logs from the kitchen. Can you cover for me while I'm gone? Natsume: I'll go fetch them instead. I need to put in another order anyway. Kanna: Alright, that'd be great. Thank you. Kanna: I apologize for the delay, sir. We'll have them ready in just a minute, so please be patient. Natsume: Order coming in. Two plates of pancakes, please. Kousei: Got it. Suzune: How are the Yule Logs selling? Natsume: Fairly well. Most of the customers who've placed advance orders have arrived to pick them up too. Suzune: Phew. That's a relief... Kousei: Were you that worried? Suzune: Well, yeah. I don't know if they're pranks or what, but sometimes you'll get large orders and then the customer never comes to pick it up. Kousei: That kind of stuff actually happens? I've read stories online, but it's scary how easy it is for a single person to screw you over. Suzune: Fortunately, it doesn't look like that's the case this time. Suzune: Anyway, back to work. Pancakes, was it? Kousei: Yeah. I'll handle them. Suzune: You will? Well, okay. Natsume: I'd better get these Yule Logs delivered too. Suzune: I'll help you carry them. I want to see how our customers are doing anyway. Mei: Welcome to Cafe Stella! Miyama: Hello again. Mei: Oh? You're Yuina-chan's--ah, I beg your pardon. Hello there, Mister Miyama. Miyama: Oh, you don't need to be so formal. Miyama: Actually, I'm also here to pick up a cake that I ordered. Mei: A Yule Log, yes? Wait right here; I'll have it out to you in one moment. Suzune: Welcome. Miyama: Hello again. I just can't ignore your cakes, they're so good. Miyama: My daughter's been looking forward to this for a while too. She says no other cake shop will do. Suzune: I'm flattered. I sincerely hope it's to your liking. Miyama: Oh, no need to worry about that. I'm confident it will be every bit as delicious as all the others I've had before. I'm looking forward to it as well. Suzune: Thank you very much. Your praise means a lot to me. Miyama: Oh, and before I forget. Could I also get some shortcakes, fruit tarts... this cheesecake here... and some mousse cakes, as well? Miyama: Four of each. I'm planning to give them to a few acquaintances as gifts. I'd like more people to see how delicious your cakes are. Especially since it's Christmas Eve, you know. Suzune: Would you like us to include some sort of message? It wouldn't take much time to add a simple plaque to it. Miyama: Oh, no. They're just going to be small gifts for some of my coworkers. I have to get back there once I'm done here. Suzune: It seems like you'll have quite a lot to carry, though... Miyama: Maybe, but I'll manage somehow. The hospital is only a few minutes' walk from here. Suzune: Alright. Mei: Here you are, Mister Miyama. Suzune: Ah, Mei-san. He'd also like shortcakes, fruit tarts, cheesecakes, and champagne mousses. Four of each. Mei: O-Oh, sure! I'll add those to your order. Mei: Let's see... In that case, your total comes to 11,820 yen. Miyama: Alright. One second... Wait, where's my wallet? What? Miyama: Ahh, right. I put it in my bag earlier. Phew. There it is. Miyama: My apologies. Mei: No problem, sir. Now then, you paid with 12,000 yen, so your change comes to 180 yen. Here you are. Miyama: Thank you very much. Suzune: Since you've got quite a few cakes, we separated them into two boxes for you. Miyama: Thank you. Suzune: Thank you for coming, and have a good day. Mei: Come visit us again sometime! Mei: Is he going to be okay with all those cakes? He's not going to get sick, is he? Suzune: They're not all for him. He said he's giving them as gifts to some of his coworkers. Mei: Oh, that makes sense. I guess there's nothing to worry about then. Mei: Ah--welcome to Cafe Stella! Suzune: You know, honestly, it's a lot easier making cakes than dealing with customers. Kousei: How are things looking out there? Suzune: Excellent. Everyone seems as happy as a clam. Suzune: But more importantly, why don't you take a break soon? Things are starting to wind down now. Kousei: Alright. Just let me finish up with this and I will. Kousei: Phew... Mikado: Understood. In that case, we will hold on to it for the meantime. Kousei: Yeah. Mikado: Yes... Yes... Kousei: Is there some kind of problem? Nozomi: Apparently one of our customers forgot something at the cafe, so they called to make sure it's still here. Nozomi: Yeah. They left in a rush so they wouldn't be holding up any other customers. You know how busy the cafe is today, with everyone coming in to pick up their cakes. Mikado: I understand. We'll be waiting. Goodbye. Nozomi: Are they coming back to get it? Mikado: Yes. However, he says that he is rather busy at work at the moment, so he does not know when that will be. Kousei: Then should we keep the bag in the fridge in the meantime? Mikado: No need. I am told it merely contains a Christmas present for his daughter. Kousei: Oh. But if so, he'll need to come get it by tonight. Kousei: As a parent, he's got to be feeling pretty anxious. Nozomi: Probably, yeah. Mikado: Hmm. Would you be willing to deliver it to him for us, Takamine Kousei? Nozomi: Oh, you're right! We can just bring it to him instead! Kousei: I guess I don't mind. Does he live around here? Mikado: You remember the little girl named Miyama Yuina who came to order a cake for her father's birthday, don't you? Mikado: The customer who forgot this present is her father. Kousei: Ahh. So that means I'll be going to the Miwa General Hospital? Mikado: Indeed. It might ruin the surprise for little Yuina if you were to deliver to their house instead. Nozomi: That's probably why her dad wanted to come pick it up himself. Mikado: Yes. Kousei: But that's enough reminiscing. I have a job to do. Kousei: No, I'm looking for a Dr. Miyama. I'm here to return something he forgot. Female Nurse: Ahh. Yes, I've been told. Female Nurse: Please give me a moment. He said he'd like to thank you in person. Female Nurse: He says he'll be with you in a minute. Would you mind waiting? It won't be long. Kousei: Sure. Kousei: Huh? Oh, I'm sorry. I was spacing out a little. Miyama: That's quite alright. I'm the one who should be apologizing. Some father I am, forgetting my own daughter's Christmas present. Miyama: Thank you for returning it to me. I truly appreciate it. Kousei: It was no big deal. Kousei: Can I ask you a question, though? These drawings--they haven't always been here, have they? Miyama: Oh, have they not? They were here when I first started working here. ???: Oh? Dr. Miyama? What are you doing out here? "

Mature-Looking Student 3: Yeah, we had a different waitress at our table. Mature-Looking Student 1: And the place was pretty busy, so I doubt you had time to stop and look around. Mature-Looking Student 3: Seriously, it was packed! There was even a bit of a line before we could get in. Natsume: Did you come on the weekend? Mature-Looking Student 1: Yeah, Saturday. Natsume: You should come again on a weekday. There usually aren't any lines then. Mature-Looking Student 3: Yeah, you bet! Those cakes were freaking amazing! Natsume: What about you? What did you think? Mature-Looking Student 1: They were insanely good. I can see why your cafe's so popular. Mature-Looking Student 3: I know, right? The atmosphere inside was really nice too. Natsume: I'm glad you like it. Mature-Looking Student 3: Oh, don't worry--everyone's been raving about your cafe online. Mature-Looking Student 1: Totally. One sec... Here, see? You're one of the very first search results! Mature-Looking Student 3: Don't you guys name search yourselves on the internet? Natsume: I've been meaning to, to see what people are saying... but it's a little scary. Mature-Looking Student 1: Relax! No one's got a single bad thing to say about you all! Natsume: Ah. Well, thank you. I'll give it a shot sometime. Mature-Looking Student 3: Hey, so could you tell us what the best item on the menu is? I'm gonna try ordering it the next time we visit. Natsume: I think everything's delicious, but in terms of sheer numbers, the strawberry tart is our best-selling item. Natsume: That said, I'd also recommend trying something other than our cakes, like the omelet rice or carbonara. Mature-Looking Student 1: Oh, I read that online too! They say they're pretty good. Mature-Looking Student 3: I'll try ordering one of those next time. Maybe... for lunch? Does it still get packed during lunchtime on weekdays? Natsume: A little bit. But as long as you aren't there right at noon, you shouldn't have to wait in line. Mature-Looking Student 3: Alright! Then we'll stop by during a weekday next time. Natsume: I look forward to seeing you there. Mature-Looking Student 1: See you then! Kousei: No, err--not exactly. I just didn't feel like barging into your conversation.

Miyama: We already had the Christmas concert, didn't we? Patient: No, no. I meant something more personal. Don't you wanna give a gift to your cutest patient? Patient: I promise I won't tell your wife and daughter. Miyama: Will you PLEASE stop saying such misleading things?! Female Nurse: Dr. Miyama? Miyama: It's not what it sounds like! This is just another one of her sick jokes! Miyama: *sigh* Alright. You can have some of the cake I bought. But keep it a secret between us, okay? Patient: Okie dokie. Your wife and daughter will never have to know. Miyama: Cut it out. That's really not funny. Miyama: But come to think of it--didn't you say you stayed here a couple years back? Patient: Yep. Miyama: Would you happen to know anything about these drawings on the wall? Patient: What's there to know? I know that they were drawn by other kids in the hospital, at least. Patient: Actually, one of 'em is mine. See the one with the mountain climber? I drew that. Miyama: Oh, really? Then it seems you got what you wished for. Patient: I guess so. Although I did end up breaking my ankle on the climb... The forecast didn't say anything about rain. Patient: But anyway, why do you ask? Miyama: This young man says these drawings weren't always here. Patient: He's right. They started this tradition years ago, the last time I was hospitalized here. Patient: If I remember correctly... there was this patient who was a relative of some famous painter, and she'd get mailed these different paintings when her family couldn't come to visit... Kousei: ...... Patient: When the doctor at the time saw those, he decided to ask the kids in the hospital to draw their favorite things too, so they could use them to decorate the hospital. Miyama: Really? I had no idea. Miyama: If you have any questions about these drawings, she might be able to answer them for you. Kousei: Thank you, but I've heard enough. Miyama: Oh. Are you sure? Kousei: Yes. I was just a little curious; it's nothing important. Kousei: Anyway, I'd better get going. I need to get back to work. Miyama: Alright. Thank you again for today. I really appreciate it. Kousei: No problem. I hope we'll see you again. Miyama: Of course. I'll definitely come by and visit again. Patient: What are you talking about? Miyama: He works at a nearby cafe. They make some amazing cakes. Patient: Ohh! Is that where you bought those cakes? Miyama: It sure is. You're in for a treat. Patient: Woohoo! Kousei: Now then, if you'll excuse me. Miyama: Take care. Kousei: I'm back. Mikado: Everything went well, I hope? Kousei: Yeah. I handed the present back to Miyama-san himself. Mikado: Ah. That's good to hear. Mikado: Feel free to rest for a while before getting back to work. I will let the others know where you are. Kousei: Thanks, but I'm fine. The hospital wasn't that far. Mikado: Alright. As you wish. Mei: Phew! We made it, somehow. Nozomi: Thank goodness we didn't have any problems. Mei: Yeah, you said it. Suzune: Well, let's cut into this Yule Log. Nozomi: Don't tell me you saved one just for us? Suzune: As much as I'd like to say so, this is actually just a leftover from today's cancellations. Suzune: It hurt to throw out the rest, but I couldn't bring myself to sell them tomorrow at half price. We aren't a convenience store or a supermarket. Nozomi: Well, I got a good workout today, so I guess a little cake won't hurt. Yep! Ehehe! Mikado: Hmm. I hate to put a damper on things, but I will have to pass on the cake. Mikado: I am not very fond of sweets, personally. Especially if it contains fresh cream. Mei: Oh, really? Mei: Aww, yeah! Nozomi: Don't mind if we do! Suzune: Would you want me to whip up something else for you instead, Mikado-san? Mikado: That is quite alright. As long as my food isn't of the dry variety, I will be fine. Suzune: Come again? Mikado: Don't worry about it. But in any case, I appreciate the thought. Mikado: ...... Natsume: Okay. I get the message. Mikado: Mhm. Thank you kindly. Mikado: Now if you'll excuse me, I must go calculate our total sales for today. Mei: Someone's in a good mood. Nozomi: Yeah, it's not often you see Mikado-san smiling like that. Suzune: And what was that about \"dry food\"? Does he usually eat overcooked meat or something? Kanna: He just has more picky tastes in food than the average person. He probably just didn't want to impose. Mei: Now that you mention it, I don't think I've ever seen him eating lunch at work before. Kanna: At any rate, I'm sure Mikado-san means it when he says he appreciates the thought. Suzune: Well, if you say so. Suzune: Anyway--good work today, guys. Kanna: You especially, Suzune-san. You carried most of the weight. Natsume & Nozomi & Mei: Thank you. Kousei: So, do you think business is going to start slowing down tomorrow? Suzune: That's how it was at Patisserie Sourian in the days leading up to the New Year, at least. Natsume: We are getting more popular around the neighborhood these days, but a lot of our customers are also students. Natsume: And since it's winter break, we're probably going to have fewer customers than usual. Suzune: On the bright side, I guess that means less cakes we'll have to bake. Natsume: Still, I hope our customers don't forget about us after the holidays. Mei: With how delicious this Christmas cake is, I don't think we have to worry about that. Nozomi: Definitely. I don't see how anyone could forget Suzune-san's cakes; they're way too delicious! Suzune: Speaking of cakes, I'm also thinking of doing another special promotion for the new year. Kousei: Oh? What do you have in mind? Suzune: A Mont Blanc. Also, a pancake with extra strawberries, as a limited-time winter special. What do you think? Mei: Hmm... If those pancakes sell well, we might even get another huge boost in customers! Mei: I feel like my friends at school are always talking about strawberries. Kousei: Oh, really? Suzune: Well, let's save that discussion for later. We're all exhausted, so for now, let's just take it easy and relax. Nozomi: Would you like me to rub your shoulders? I give my dad massages, and he says I'm really good at it. Suzune: Seriously? Well, if you're offering, I guess I'll have one. Nozomi: Sure thing. Don't mind if I do. Nozomi: Glad to be of service! Ehehe. Kousei: ...... Kousei: ...... Kousei: I'm not. Kanna: Aww, you silly thing. Don't lie: you got a little aroused there for a second, didn't you? And then you thought, \"Nevermind, I take that back.\" Kousei: Well, it's kinda hard to feel aroused when she starts moaning like an old geezer. Kanna: Nihihi! Disappointed, weren'tcha? Kousei: Oh, leave me alone. Kousei: Sure, I guess. Can we not do it now? Natsume: Well... there's something I want to give you. Kousei: Okay? Natsume: Here's a hint. What day is it today? Kousei: ...... Natsume: You'll see later. Kousei: Sorry. I forgot... Kousei: It's so warm... and it's practically flowing with juices too... Kousei: Oh God... I can't wait any longer. C-Can I? Natsume: Sure, go right ahead. It's all yours, Takamine-kun... Kousei: Alright. Don't mind if I do! Kousei: Mhh! This is good... Natsume: I used lard instead of oil when making the dough, and added Chinese soup and shiitake broth to the meat inside. Kousei: Well, it's a huge improvement. These are really good. Kousei: I can definitely see why Suzune-san suggested these changes. Kousei: These added flavors really enhance the taste. Natsume: I'm glad the difference is that noticeable. Natsume: I thought they turned out pretty well myself, but I wanted to get a second opinion. Kousei: So that's why you invited me over? Natsume: Yeah. Sorry to bother you on Christmas. Kousei: It's okay. Not like I had anything else to do, really. Kousei: But I wish you could've just asked me normally, instead of being so, y'know... suggestive. Natsume: Oh, did I get your hopes up? Kousei: You were doing it on purpose, weren't you? Natsume: Maybe. So, what day is it today? Kousei: Six days before the new year. Meaning, less than a week to go until the festival. Natsume: Ding ding ding. You're right. And as a reward for answering correctly, you get one more new-and-improved meat bun. Kousei: Whoopee. I'm so happy. Natsume: That sounded a lot like sarcasm. Girls don't like it when you make fun of them, you know? Kousei: Yeah, well, guys don't like it when you play with their feelings by pointlessly leading them on. Kousei: Or was this all part of your master plan to tease me? Natsume: Oh, please. I'm not that bored. Natsume: I'll get them to try it too, just once it's perfected. I didn't want to have too many different taste-testers all telling me what to change at once, you know? Natsume: I hope so. Unlike with the cafe, we won't have enough time to rely on word of mouth to attract customers. Kousei: Well, that's what the qipao is for, isn't it? Natsume: Urk... Can you not remind me? That was way too embarrassing. Kousei: But you said you'd wear it, didn't you? Natsume: Well, yes. Kousei: Welp, I guess I better get going now. Natsume: Ah--wait a minute. I've got one last question for you. What day is it today? Kousei: Didn't I already answer that? It's six days before the new year, and less an a week to go until the festival. Natsume: That was the first question. I'm asking you a different one right now. What day is it today? Kousei: Christmas? Kousei: But... Natsume: It's not a trick question. Kousei: It's too easy, though. There's gotta be a catch. Natsume: Is that your final answer? Kousei: Sure. The answer is Christmas. Natsume: Bingo. You're correct. Natsume: Didn't I tell you earlier that I had something to give you? Kousei: Yeah, but I thought you meant the meat bun. Natsume: I never said that. Kousei: True. That was only an assumption on my part. Kousei: But I kinda wish you'd stop screwing with me for no reason. Natsume: You should've seen the look of surprise on your face, though. Pfft. It was hilarious. Kousei: Oh, is that so? Well, I'm glad that you find my face so amusing. Natsume: Oh, stop sulking. It's not a joke present, I promise. Kousei: Th-Thanks. Kousei: But I don't have anything to give you. Natsume: That's fine. I wasn't expecting anything in return. Natsume: Just think of it as a token of appreciation. For the takoyaki party, and the hard work you've been putting in day after day. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Sorry, but I'd just feel too bad taking this without giving you anything. Kousei: Hold on for a bit. I'm gonna go buy you something right now. Kousei: I won't be long, I promise! Let's see... thirty minutes. I'll be back in thirty minutes. Natsume: --closed. *sigh*... Listen to me, will you? I said I didn't need a present... Natsume: Now you're the one getting my hopes up... Tch. Kousei: *pant* *pant*... Kousei: Hrmmmm. Kousei: Oh, I know! There might be some shops at the station still open for a little longer. Kousei: Err, so about the present. Kousei: I'm really sorry. I tried looking, but everywhere was closed. Natsume: Don't worry about it. Like I said, this is mostly just a token of appreciation. Kousei: I mean, I actually did buy you something. Kousei: But since most places were closed, I didn't have a wide selection to choose from. Before you say anything, I just wanted to let you know: I didn't buy this on account of my own personal tastes. Natsume: What, is it some kind of cosplay thing? Kousei: No. Definitely not. Kousei: Yeah, that'd be a bit too cringy, even for me. Kousei: But I'm not too confident you'll like it either, so I'd appreciate it if you could open it after I leave. Kousei: If I see you frown after taking a look at it, I'm not sure I'll be able to take it. Natsume: I'd never do something that rude, but fine. I'll open it later. Kousei: ...... Kousei: ...... Kousei: I feel kinda bad now. Compared to this scarf, the present I bought her seems mediocre. Kousei: But I already gave it to her, so it's too late now. Kousei: I suppose I could try giving her another present tomorrow... but she probably wouldn't accept it. Kousei: Maybe I should've picked something else, after all? Natsume: Tch. I hate to admit it, but I might actually use this. Natsume: ...... Natsume: I really hate to admit how much I like it. "

            "Patient: Oh, wow. Your daughter would've been quite upset with you if you'd lost it. Miyama: I know. Patient: So? Where's MY Christmas present? Miyama: We already had the Christmas concert, didn't we? Patient: No, no. I meant something more personal. Don't you wanna give a gift to your cutest patient? Patient: I promise I won't tell your wife and daughter. Miyama: Will you PLEASE stop saying such misleading things?! Female Nurse: Dr. Miyama? Miyama: It's not what it sounds like! This is just another one of her sick jokes! Miyama: *sigh* Alright. You can have some of the cake I bought. But keep it a secret between us, okay? Patient: Okie dokie. Your wife and daughter will never have to know. Miyama: Cut it out. That's really not funny. Miyama: But come to think of it--didn't you say you stayed here a couple years back? Patient: Yep. Miyama: Would you happen to know anything about these drawings on the wall? Patient: What's there to know? I know that they were drawn by other kids in the hospital, at least. Patient: Actually, one of 'em is mine. See the one with the mountain climber? I drew that. Miyama: Oh, really? Then it seems you got what you wished for. Patient: I guess so. Although I did end up breaking my ankle on the climb... The forecast didn't say anything about rain. Patient: But anyway, why do you ask? Miyama: This young man says these drawings weren't always here. Patient: He's right. They started this tradition years ago, the last time I was hospitalized here. Patient: If I remember correctly... there was this patient who was a relative of some famous painter, and she'd get mailed these different paintings when her family couldn't come to visit... Kousei: ...... Patient: When the doctor at the time saw those, he decided to ask the kids in the hospital to draw their favorite things too, so they could use them to decorate the hospital. Miyama: Really? I had no idea. Miyama: If you have any questions about these drawings, she might be able to answer them for you. Kousei: Thank you, but I've heard enough. Miyama: Oh. Are you sure? Kousei: Yes. I was just a little curious; it's nothing important. Kousei: Anyway, I'd better get going. I need to get back to work. Miyama: Alright. Thank you again for today. I really appreciate it. Kousei: No problem. I hope we'll see you again. Miyama: Of course. I'll definitely come by and visit again. Patient: What are you talking about? Miyama: He works at a nearby cafe. They make some amazing cakes. Patient: Ohh! Is that where you bought those cakes? Miyama: It sure is. You're in for a treat. Patient: Woohoo! Kousei: Now then, if you'll excuse me. Miyama: Take care. Kousei: I'm back. Mikado: Everything went well, I hope? Kousei: Yeah. I handed the present back to Miyama-san himself. Mikado: Ah. That's good to hear. Mikado: Feel free to rest for a while before getting back to work. I will let the others know where you are. Kousei: Thanks, but I'm fine. The hospital wasn't that far. Mikado: Alright. As you wish. Mei: Phew! We made it, somehow. Nozomi: Thank goodness we didn't have any problems. Mei: Yeah, you said it. Suzune: Well, let's cut into this Yule Log. Nozomi: Don't tell me you saved one just for us? Suzune: As much as I'd like to say so, this is actually just a leftover from today's cancellations. Suzune: It hurt to throw out the rest, but I couldn't bring myself to sell them tomorrow at half price. We aren't a convenience store or a supermarket. Nozomi: Well, I got a good workout today, so I guess a little cake won't hurt. Yep! Ehehe! Mikado: Hmm. I hate to put a damper on things, but I will have to pass on the cake. Mikado: I am not very fond of sweets, personally. Especially if it contains fresh cream. Mei: Oh, really? Mei: Aww, yeah! Nozomi: Don't mind if we do! Suzune: Would you want me to whip up something else for you instead, Mikado-san? Mikado: That is quite alright. As long as my food isn't of the dry variety, I will be fine. Suzune: Come again? Mikado: Don't worry about it. But in any case, I appreciate the thought. Mikado: ...... Natsume: Okay. I get the message. Mikado: Mhm. Thank you kindly. Mikado: Now if you'll excuse me, I must go calculate our total sales for today. Mei: Someone's in a good mood. Nozomi: Yeah, it's not often you see Mikado-san smiling like that. Suzune: And what was that about \"dry food\"? Does he usually eat overcooked meat or something? Kanna: He just has more picky tastes in food than the average person. He probably just didn't want to impose. Mei: Now that you mention it, I don't think I've ever seen him eating lunch at work before. Kanna: At any rate, I'm sure Mikado-san means it when he says he appreciates the thought. Suzune: Well, if you say so. Suzune: Anyway--good work today, guys. Kanna: You especially, Suzune-san. You carried most of the weight. Natsume & Nozomi & Mei: Thank you. Kousei: So, do you think business is going to start slowing down tomorrow? Suzune: That's how it was at Patisserie Sourian in the days leading up to the New Year, at least. Natsume: We are getting more popular around the neighborhood these days, but a lot of our customers are also students. Natsume: And since it's winter break, we're probably going to have fewer customers than usual. Suzune: On the bright side, I guess that means less cakes we'll have to bake. Natsume: Still, I hope our customers don't forget about us after the holidays. Mei: With how delicious this Christmas cake is, I don't think we have to worry about that. Nozomi: Definitely. I don't see how anyone could forget Suzune-san's cakes; they're way too delicious! Suzune: Speaking of cakes, I'm also thinking of doing another special promotion for the new year. Kousei: Oh? What do you have in mind? Suzune: A Mont Blanc. Also, a pancake with extra strawberries, as a limited-time winter special. What do you think? Mei: Hmm... If those pancakes sell well, we might even get another huge boost in customers! Mei: I feel like my friends at school are always talking about strawberries. Kousei: Oh, really? Suzune: Well, let's save that discussion for later. We're all exhausted, so for now, let's just take it easy and relax. Nozomi: Would you like me to rub your shoulders? I give my dad massages, and he says I'm really good at it. Suzune: Seriously? Well, if you're offering, I guess I'll have one. Nozomi: Sure thing. Don't mind if I do. Nozomi: Glad to be of service! Ehehe. Kousei: ...... Kousei: ...... Kousei: I'm not. Kanna: Aww, you silly thing. Don't lie: you got a little aroused there for a second, didn't you? And then you thought, \"Nevermind, I take that back.\" Kousei: Well, it's kinda hard to feel aroused when she starts moaning like an old geezer. Kanna: Nihihi! Disappointed, weren'tcha? Kousei: Oh, leave me alone. Kousei: Sure, I guess. Can we not do it now? Natsume: Well... there's something I want to give you. Kousei: Okay? Natsume: Here's a hint. What day is it today? Kousei: ...... Natsume: You'll see later. Kousei: Sorry. I forgot... Kousei: It's so warm... and it's practically flowing with juices too... Kousei: Oh God... I can't wait any longer. C-Can I? Natsume: Sure, go right ahead. It's all yours, Takamine-kun... Kousei: Alright. Don't mind if I do! Kousei: Mhh! This is good... Natsume: I used lard instead of oil when making the dough, and added Chinese soup and shiitake broth to the meat inside. Kousei: Well, it's a huge improvement. These are really good. Kousei: I can definitely see why Suzune-san suggested these changes. Kousei: These added flavors really enhance the taste. Natsume: I'm glad the difference is that noticeable. Natsume: I thought they turned out pretty well myself, but I wanted to get a second opinion. Kousei: So that's why you invited me over? Natsume: Yeah. Sorry to bother you on Christmas. Kousei: It's okay. Not like I had anything else to do, really. Kousei: But I wish you could've just asked me normally, instead of being so, y'know... suggestive. Natsume: Oh, did I get your hopes up? Kousei: You were doing it on purpose, weren't you? Natsume: Maybe. So, what day is it today? Kousei: Six days before the new year. Meaning, less than a week to go until the festival. Natsume: Ding ding ding. You're right. And as a reward for answering correctly, you get one more new-and-improved meat bun. Kousei: Whoopee. I'm so happy. Natsume: That sounded a lot like sarcasm. Girls don't like it when you make fun of them, you know? Kousei: Yeah, well, guys don't like it when you play with their feelings by pointlessly leading them on. Kousei: Or was this all part of your master plan to tease me? Natsume: Oh, please. I'm not that bored. Natsume: I'll get them to try it too, just once it's perfected. I didn't want to have too many different taste-testers all telling me what to change at once, you know? Natsume: I hope so. Unlike with the cafe, we won't have enough time to rely on word of mouth to attract customers. Kousei: Well, that's what the qipao is for, isn't it? Natsume: Urk... Can you not remind me? That was way too embarrassing. Kousei: But you said you'd wear it, didn't you? Natsume: Well, yes. Kousei: Welp, I guess I better get going now. Natsume: Ah--wait a minute. I've got one last question for you. What day is it today? Kousei: Didn't I already answer that? It's six days before the new year, and less an a week to go until the festival. Natsume: That was the first question. I'm asking you a different one right now. What day is it today? Kousei: Christmas? Kousei: But... Natsume: It's not a trick question. Kousei: It's too easy, though. There's gotta be a catch. Natsume: Is that your final answer? Kousei: Sure. The answer is Christmas. Natsume: Bingo. You're correct. Natsume: Didn't I tell you earlier that I had something to give you? Kousei: Yeah, but I thought you meant the meat bun. Natsume: I never said that. Kousei: True. That was only an assumption on my part. Kousei: But I kinda wish you'd stop screwing with me for no reason. Natsume: You should've seen the look of surprise on your face, though. Pfft. It was hilarious. Kousei: Oh, is that so? Well, I'm glad that you find my face so amusing. Natsume: Oh, stop sulking. It's not a joke present, I promise. Kousei: Th-Thanks. Kousei: But I don't have anything to give you. Natsume: That's fine. I wasn't expecting anything in return. Natsume: Just think of it as a token of appreciation. For the takoyaki party, and the hard work you've been putting in day after day. Kousei: ...... Kousei: Sorry, but I'd just feel too bad taking this without giving you anything. Kousei: Hold on for a bit. I'm gonna go buy you something right now. Kousei: I won't be long, I promise! Let's see... thirty minutes. I'll be back in thirty minutes. Natsume: --closed. *sigh*... Listen to me, will you? I said I didn't need a present... Natsume: Now you're the one getting my hopes up... Tch. Kousei: *pant* *pant*... Kousei: Hrmmmm. Kousei: Oh, I know! There might be some shops at the station still open for a little longer. Kousei: Err, so about the present. Kousei: I'm really sorry. I tried looking, but everywhere was closed. Natsume: Don't worry about it. Like I said, this is mostly just a token of appreciation. Kousei: I mean, I actually did buy you something. Kousei: But since most places were closed, I didn't have a wide selection to choose from. Before you say anything, I just wanted to let you know: I didn't buy this on account of my own personal tastes. Natsume: What, is it some kind of cosplay thing? Kousei: No. Definitely not. Kousei: Yeah, that'd be a bit too cringy, even for me. Kousei: But I'm not too confident you'll like it either, so I'd appreciate it if you could open it after I leave. Kousei: If I see you frown after taking a look at it, I'm not sure I'll be able to take it. Natsume: I'd never do something that rude, but fine. I'll open it later. Kousei: ...... Kousei: ...... Kousei: I feel kinda bad now. Compared to this scarf, the present I bought her seems mediocre. Kousei: But I already gave it to her, so it's too late now. Kousei: I suppose I could try giving her another present tomorrow... but she probably wouldn't accept it. Kousei: Maybe I should've picked something else, after all? Natsume: Tch. I hate to admit it, but I might actually use this. Natsume: ...... Natsume: I really hate to admit how much I like it. "

I think there was one batch with spicy octopus, another with pickled plum, and then some with a sweet bean paste filling... Not to mention the usual cheese and bonito flakes combination. And don't even get me started on the... (pauses, looking slightly flustered) Okay, okay, it's just takoyaki. It was good, all right? Don't look at me like that!",

            "Store Clerk: Thank you very much. That will be 180 yen. Natsume: A guy and a girl going out together? Sounds like a date to me. A meat bun date. Kousei: ...... Natsume: Something wrong? Kousei: Nothing. Kousei: But honestly, you could've just messaged me that. Kousei: Ah, yeah. It's hard to compose a perfect, easy-to-respond-to message without sounding annoying sometimes. Natsume: I was struggling with the same thing yesterday too. Kousei: Hm? Natsume: N-Nevermind. Kousei: Still, I'm surprised. I didn't think you'd be so enthusiastic about this... Natsume: Well, I agreed to do it, so I might as well do it right. Natsume: Besides... you said... Kousei: Me? Natsume: You said you wanted to show that priest what you're capable of, didn't you? Kousei: Well, yeah... Natsume: It's not exactly to \"return the favor,\" per se, but I wanted to put as much effort into the stall as you did into helping me. Natsume: Since it's Christmas next week, I know you're going to be pretty busy in the kitchen. Natsume: So I thought I'd go the extra step in the meantime, and hopefully lighten your workload a bit... Kousei: Well, I'm definitely grateful for the help. Natsume: You're welcome. Anyway, I thought we'd start by deciding how we want our meat buns to taste. That's why I wanted you to come with me today. Kousei: Yeah, of course. Kousei: I mean, uh, thanks. For doing all this for me... Although that sounds a little presumptuous. Sorry. Natsume: Well, since I'm technically doing this to repay you, you're not exactly wrong. Kousei: R-Right... Natsume: I want to do everything I can to contribute. So, um, just to make sure: do you really... want me to... Kousei: What? Natsume: Ah... nevermind. Natsume: Anyway, that's the plan for today. Now come on, there's other stores I want to visit. Kousei: Alright. Natsume: Okay, I'll head down to the lower level. In the meantime, you check out the convenience stores up here and buy whatever they have on sale. Kousei: What if they sell two different kinds of meat buns? Should I buy both? Natsume: Hmm. One is probably enough. I'll leave it up to you to decide which one. Kousei: Got it. Natsume: Let's meet back here in thirty minutes. Kousei: Where are we going to eat all these buns anyway? The food court? Kousei: Then again, we probably shouldn't bring all this outside food there. Natsume: We can just eat at my place. Kousei: Alright. See you in thirty minutes then. Kousei: Hmm. Shiki-san's place. Kousei: ...... Kousei: %123;Urk?! Kousei: Her--wait, WHAT?! Natsume: Alright. Let's do this. Kousei: ...... Kousei: O-Oh. Sorry. Kousei: I didn't mean to. I'm just a little nervous. Natsume: Just so we're clear, I only invited you up here to eat, okay? Kousei: I-I know. I wasn't expecting anything else. Natsume: Well, good. Sit wherever you like. I'll get us something to drink. Kousei: Sure. Thanks. Kousei: Thanks. Natsume: Alright then. Let's eat. Kousei: Mhm. Natsume: Ahmph... *munch*... Mhh, this one's pretty good. Kousei: Even the convenience store ones are pretty decent. Nice and meaty. Kousei: Yours was from a Chinese restaurant, wasn't it? Natsume: Yeah, I got takeout. It's a little sweeter, maybe because of the veggies. Here, give it a try. Kousei: You want me to eat that? Natsume: How else are you going to figure out what it tastes like? Kousei: I mean, yeah, but like... Natsume: Do you want some or not? Kousei: I-I do. Thanks. Kousei: It's gotta be the onions. Oh, do you want to try some of mine too? Natsume: Sure. I'd better. Natsume: What? Kousei: It's nothing. "

I mean, why wouldn't they? It's not like we were all just sitting there eating takoyaki in silence, waiting for the perfect shot.\n\nAnyway, when I finally got around to calling them back about my absence, they were all... nice... about it, of course. But, I could tell they were just being polite. They said things like \"Oh, Shiki's fine\" and \"We know she had other stuff going on\", but I'm pretty sure they're still all upset with me for missing the party.\n\nTo be honest, I don't really care if you think this is a trivial matter or not, but it bothers me that people always prioritize their social media posts over actual human connections. Just because we can post pictures of ourselves eating food online doesn't mean it's more important than spending time with real friends. *mutter mutter*",
        "generated_ollama_with_rag": "*sigh* Ah, yeah... That was a while ago. So, we had planned to go get takoyaki at that new food stand near campus, but I ended up having to work an extra shift at the cafe. By the time I got out of there, everyone else had already left and it was just me, eating takoyaki by myself.\n\nAnd then, after that... well, let's just say things were a bit awkward with them for a while. We didn't really talk about what happened or anything. It wasn't like we fell out as friends or anything, but... I don't know, it felt like they'd forgotten all about me or something.\n\nBut, anyway... that was probably around the time when I started to realize just how little people actually care about you until something affects them directly. And then, just like that, everyone's suddenly paying attention again.\n\n(But don't tell anyone I said this, okay?)",

            "Natsume: Yeah. It's starting to look a lot like Christmas, isn't it? Kousei: Oh, right. That was the plan... Kousei: You know, a party where you eat takoyaki. Kousei: You mentioned before how you missed your chance to go to your friend's. I just remembered. Natsume: You don't think I've been dragging that around all these years, do you? Kousei: Well, no. Natsume: Then why bring it up? Kousei: I mean... Kousei: It's normal for a college student to want to ask a girl out during the Christmas season, isn't it? Natsume: Then why don't you try asking more normally? Natsume: Using my childhood as an excuse is kind of lame, if you ask me. Kousei: C'mon, give me a break. I couldn't think of anything else. Kousei: No doubt many better-looking, more sociable guys than me have asked you out to some stylish cafe before, but you turned them all down. Kousei: So I figured I wouldn't have any luck trying the same thing. Natsume: Hmm. A takoyaki party... Kousei: You aren't upset at me, are you? Kousei: I didn't-- Natsume: ...... Kousei: Earth to Shiki-san? Natsume: Do you have a takoyaki maker? Kousei: Huh? Err, not really. Kousei: I'm sure they sell them around here, though. I wouldn't mind buying one, if need be. Natsume: Ah. Well, why don't we go look for one? Kousei: ...... Kousei: Wait, what?! Natsume: Why do you look so surprised? You're the one who suggested it. Kousei: I, uhh, yeah... but it just kinda caught me off-guard. I didn't think you'd actually agree to it. Natsume: Do you want to do this or not? Kousei: I do! Absolutely! "
