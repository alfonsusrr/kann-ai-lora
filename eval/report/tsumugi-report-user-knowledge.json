            "Meguru: Hey, guess what? I brought cupcakes! Tsumugi, Touko: Oooh♪ Tsumugi: Oh, yeah. Your cookies and pudding were great! I'm sure your cupcakes are good too. Meguru: They turned out pretty well, I think. Alright, here you go, Tsumugi-senpai! Tsumugi: Wow♪ Thanks～ Meguru: Togakushi-senpai, here's yours! Touko: Ooh♪ This is such a wonderful surprise. Thank you. Nene: Can I try one as well? Meguru: Of course you can! I made a ton of 'em. There's no way I'd leave you out!  Meguru: So here, take one! Nene: Thank you very much. I'll have a taste. Shuuji: Oh... Thanks. A girl's homemade cupcake, huh... Meguru: I'm sure you'll like it. Shuuji: You've been pretty cheerful lately, I have to say. Meguru: Yeah, thanks to you. Tsumugi: Oh! It's great, Meguru-chan! Meguru: Really? I'm glad you like it! Touko: It's so moist and fluffy. You didn't just use some pre-packaged mix, right? I can tell you put some real effort into these. The nuts are a great touch. Nene: It's really good, Inaba-san. This tastes just as good as the stuff they sell at bakeries.  Meguru: Wow! Nene-senpai, that's so nice of you to say! Nene: Sh-Shouldn't you sit and eat your own share? Meguru: Oh, well, maybe you should feed me. Just kidding! Nene: ...? What's the matter, Inaba-san? Meguru: Oh, nothing! Meguru: Okay, I'll eat mine now. Nene: Alright, let's call it a day here. Tsumugi: 'Kay! Meguru: Ahaha. You're welcome. Shuuji: Welp, time to head home. Meguru: Ah, Senpai, Senpai. Meguru: Are you free after this? Shuuji: I guess, yeah. Meguru: Then, well... let's go home together! Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Umm... Is this another cupcake? Meguru: Y-You don't want it? Shuuji: Of course I do! I was just surprised. Shuuji: Umm... You went out of your way to make me an extra one? Meguru: ...Well, you're the one I made that promise with. Shuuji: Y-Yeah, I guess. Shuuji: Oh... Meguru: I-I'm the one thanking you, here. Meguru: Come on. Hurry up and eat it. Go, go. Shuuji: Yeah, thanks. I can't wait! Shuuji: No, you did good! It's just a little messy because I can't stop smiling while I eat. Meguru: ...... Shuuji: *munch* *munch* Yeah, it's great. This tastes awesome, Inaba-san. Meguru: ...E-Ehehehe. Meguru: Ah! Now you're making me smile and laugh too, geez! Shuuji: Huh? How is that my fault? Meguru: 'Cuz what kind of dope smiles while they eat? Meguru: You're welcome. Shuuji: Though, to be honest... I wish I had something to drink along with it. It tasted great, but now my mouth is dry. Meguru: Oh... Y-You're right! I'm sorry I didn't think of that! Meguru: Umm, there's a vending machine down the side street we talked on the other day, right? Let's go! Shuuji: Nah, no need to take a detour just for that. I was only half serious, anyway. Meguru: Oh, okay, right... Meguru: Yeah...? Shuuji: I'll take that detour after all. Wanna tag along? I wouldn't mind chatting more with you. Meguru: Ah... Meguru: Yeah! Of course! Meguru: There we go. Meguru: Hm? What's wrong, Senpai? Shuuji: Oh, nothing. Shuuji: For sure. Meguru: That's good. I was afraid you wouldn't want to eat any of my treats anymore. Shuuji: I'd never turn down more treats from you. It'd be awesome if I could have more sometime. Meguru: Roger that. Next time I'll make something easier to eat. Meguru: So... What did you want to talk about now?  Shuuji: Hm? Meguru: Don't \"hm\" me! Didn't you just say you wanted to chat some more? Shuuji: O-Ohh... Right... Meguru: You want to know? Shuuji: Yeah. After getting this involved, I'm kinda curious. I haven't heard any of the details yet. Meguru: Hmm, let's see... Meguru: Nene-senpai kept chatting away about nothing in particular. Shuuji: Oh yeah? Meguru: Other than that, I made dinner to show my thanks for letting me sleep over... Meguru: Oh, right! We also took a bath together! And even better, it was Nene-senpai who invited me for that! Meguru: And before you ask, we didn't wash each other or anything. But man, Nene-senpai has such a nice figure and pretty skin. I'm a girl and was still totally captivated. It's not fair how she gets to be both slender and voluptuous. Shuuji: Y-You don't say... Meguru: Hey, I know that look! You're picturing her right now, aren't you?! You perv! Shuuji: You can't blame me after you're the one who said all that stuff. Shuuji: Erm, I was picturing you this time. Meguru: WHAT?! Wh-Why me?! Meguru: Why would you imagine ME naked?! Compared to Nene-senpai, I'm basically flat! Shuuji: Well, I think you're both really attractive. A flat girl like you can still be hot! Meguru: ―――?! Shuuji: Err, sorry! This has been really rude of me! Forget I said anything! Meguru: W-Will do. I'll try my best! You... You see, jokes like that don't faze me one bit! Shuuji: Huh? R-Right... Meguru: R-Right! Nene-senpai was worried about whether I'm getting along with my classmates!  Shuuji: Ahh... Meguru: Y-Yeah. True, we took a bath together, ate cake together and all that... Meguru: ...... Shuuji: ...Inaba-san? Meguru: I'm sure you're curious about that too, huh? Shuuji: Huh? A-About what? Meguru: About why I decided to get a makeover when entering Himematsu. Shuuji: Well... Meguru: Yeah. Our conversation ended up there. Meguru: I didn't tell her anything. Shuuji: Huh? Meguru: It's a hard subject for me, so I just sorta glossed over it. Shuuji: ...... Meguru: But it makes me wonder if it's been weighing on her mind. And if it's been weighing on your mind as well... Shuuji: Umm...  Didn't you tell us before that you got a makeover to make yourself more approachable? Meguru: I did, and it's true, but I'm talking about what made me want to do that in the first place. Shuuji: O-Oh. Yeah... Meguru: ...... Meguru: Ah... Meguru: O-Okay. It's not a very enjoyable story, though... Ahaha... Shuuji: I don't mind. I'm just happy that you're willing to tell me. Meguru: ...Thank you. Shuuji: Alright. Go ahead. Meguru: She may have been my only one, but we were really close. We were best friends. Shuuji: ...You didn't have any other friends? Meguru: You know how clingy I can be, right? Well, back then, it was even worse. Meguru: I could be myself around Chi-chan, but not any of the other girls... Shuuji: Chi-chan, huh? Meguru: Yeah. Kizuki Chihoko. I always called her Chi-chan. Meguru: She was a very frail and quiet girl. She was a huge bookworm, though, and was super smart. Meguru: I did nothing but read books too, so we had a shared hobby and matching personalities. Meguru: I could tell her all the things that I couldn't tell anyone else. I told her everything... Meguru: ...But maybe that was the problem. Meguru: To make things worse, I tend to jabber on incessantly when I get excited. Meguru: Basically, I'm completely unfettered when it comes to everyone I'm close with... Shuuji: Yeah, I can see that. Meguru: ...... Meguru: Chi-chan stopped coming to school all of a sudden. Shuuji: Huh? Meguru: I had no idea why. She just stopped coming... Meguru: She never answered my calls or texts either. Meguru: After a while of that, I couldn't take it anymore and went over to her place. Meguru: But when I got there... her house was completely vacant. Shuuji: Huh...? Meguru: So I asked our homeroom teacher, but he wouldn't tell me anything. All he would say was that she left our school. Meguru: And now... I still have no idea where Chi-chan is or what she's currently doing... Shuuji: So... what you're saying is that she suddenly moved away and never told you? Meguru: She didn't tell me anything. She wouldn't even answer my texts or calls. Meguru: But I just figured that it made sense. Shuuji: ...Why's that? Meguru: I said something terrible to Chi-chan right before she stopped coming to school. Meguru: \"I can't get along with anyone else, but you're the only friend I want.\" Meguru: \"It's the same for you, right? So let's be friends forever.\" Shuuji: What's so terrible about that? Meguru: But when I think back on it now, I realize how put off she looked when I said that. Meguru: It was almost like I said something revolting to her... Shuuji: ...... Meguru: That's why I figured it must have been my fault that she didn't tell me anything. Meguru: Maybe it hurt her when I told her she didn't have any other friends than me. Meguru: I would say inconsiderate stuff like that and act like a selfish kid around her all the time. Maybe that was too much for her. Meguru: That must be why she disappeared from my life completely... Shuuji: But... Meguru: Partly because I lost my best friend... Meguru: But also, with Chi-chan gone, I was back to being without a single friend I could open up to. Shuuji: Ah... Meguru: So after that, I just became an introverted bookworm. Meguru: I knew I was too annoying to be good at making friends, so I was too scared to ever try again. Meguru: I also felt like I'd never get a friendship like Chi-chan's again, anyway. Meguru: And besides, not even my best friend Chi-chan wanted to be friends with me anymore. Shuuji: ...I see. Meguru: I decided I couldn't let things continue like that. Shuuji: ...... Meguru: I wanted to get good at socializing and tried my best to achieve that. Meguru: So if I were to meet Chi-chan again... I could apologize to her and tell her that I'm different now. Shuuji: ...And that's why you changed yourself when you entered Himematsu. Meguru: Yeah, exactly. Shuuji: I see... Meguru: ...I-I'm sorry. I just ended up spewing some boring, incomprehensible nonsense! Meguru: L-Let's talk about something else! Umm, err, like about MonHun― Shuuji: No. I get exactly how you feel. Shuuji: I've gone through some stuff and struggled to talk to people too. Shuuji: I've always had hardly any friends. The most I could ever muster was some smalltalk with my classmates. I would just wear a fake smile and try not to upset anyone. Shuuji: It got to the point where, just a little while back, my own dad told me I had the eyes of a dead fish. Meguru: Ah... Shuuji: Yeah, you've thought the same, I'm sure. Meguru: N-No! I would never think anything like that! I just thought you look kinda gloomy. Like you didn't have any friends and stuff... Shuuji: Yeah, that doesn't make it much better. Meguru: I'm sorry! Shuuji: It's alright. After all, it's the truth. Shuuji: But, you see, circumstances led me to joining the OC where I got in touch with everyone else's worries. That made me take a closer look at myself, which led to a thought. Meguru: Wh-Which is...? Shuuji: That I couldn't let things continue like that. Meguru: ...... Shuuji: I mean, I couldn't even muster a decent smile. It was so stiff that even I thought I looked gross. Shuuji: That inspired me to change myself. To give myself a more natural smile... Meguru: ...I see. Meguru: So you're... the same as me... Shuuji: Do you understand how I felt? Meguru: Y-Yeah! I totally do! It's almost like you were talking about me! Shuuji: Thanks. That is why I feel like I can understand your situation so well.   Shuuji: ...Thanks for telling me. Meguru: D-Don't thank me! I should thank you... Meguru: You told me about yourself, listened to my story and understood me. I'm so happy... Shuuji: Then that makes two of us. Meguru: Seems so... Ahahaha... Shuuji: ...... Meguru: ...... Shuuji: I-I guess it's about time we go home. Meguru: R-R-Right, we've been talking all evening... Meguru: Th-This is far enough. Meguru: Yeah. It's only a few minutes from here, and the streets are well-lit. Shuuji: Okay. Then I'll head home. See you on Monday, Inaba-san. Meguru: Yeah... Meguru: ...Oh, wait a moment! One last thing. Shuuji: Huh? What's up? Meguru: Umm... I don't know how to put this, but, umm... Meguru: I-I know you think you haven't been able to smile well... Shuuji: ...Huh? Meguru: But... Meguru: Your smile has never felt unpleasant to me! Shuuji: ...... Meguru: Y-Yeah... Hehe... Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Ready to have a taste of mine this time? Shuuji: Ahaha, yeah of course you― Meguru: But... Meguru: ...Can I ask for something else instead? Shuuji: What? L-Like, you want me to drink the rest of your cafe au lait or something? Meguru: ...... Shuuji: ...Inaba-san? Meguru: Meguru. Meguru: Could you, from today on... start calling me by my given name? Shuuji: ...... Meguru: ...... Meguru: N-Never mind! I take that back! Forget I said anything! Shuuji: M-Meguru. Meguru: Ah... Shuuji: Is that what you wanted? Meguru: A-Again. One more time. Shuuji: ...Meguru. Meguru: ～～～!! Shuuji: ...Hellooo Meguru. Meguru: That's me!

            "Touko: Good idea. Let's take a break, everyone. It's not good to strain yourself too much. Tsumugi: Nnngh! I'm so tired... Shuuji: Mh, nnngh... Touko: It's already this late? We must've been concentrating pretty hard. Shuuji: How about we talk about the party? Would make for a nice change of pace. Touko: That's a good idea. Nene: Then I'll go and make us some more tea. Tsumugi: Thanks, Ayachi-san. Shuuji: Hasn't it gotten a little bit dark in here? Meguru: Let's switch on the lights. Nene-senpai, is it okay to switch on the lights?  Nene: Yes, of course it is. I think I left the remote for the lights somewhere near the sofa.  Meguru: Roger that. Meguru: Remote, remote... Nene: You can't find it? Meguru: Give me a few seconds. Umm... Ah, found it. But... Huh? Shuuji: What's wrong? Meguru: ...It's a little different from the one at my home. It's smaller, and only has a few buttons. Shuuji: Wh-What are you holding there, Inaba-san?! Meguru: Well, the remote for the lights? Meguru: Alright, I'll turn on the lights now. Nene: Wait! Inaba-san! Please wait a moment! Meguru: Yeah? Why? Nene: You. Must. Not. Use. That. Switch! Meguru: Why are you talking like a robot? Nene: Who cares! That's not the right switch! It's for something else! You must not press it! Meguru: Oh, really? Then what's this remote for? It doesn't look like a remote for an air conditioner or TV. What is it? Nene: I-It's a remote detonator! Meguru: A remote detonator?! Nene: This room will explode if you press that button! You'd bomb us all! Meguru: Why would you have such a terrifying switch?! Shuuji: L-Look! O-Over here! Isn't this the remote for the lights?! Shuuji: I'll turn on the lights, so you can come back over here now. Meguru: Okay, thanks. Shuuji: Umm, Ayachi-san, here. Nene: ...Thank you, very much. Shuuji: Yeah, uh, don't worry about it. Shuuji: Anyway... Is this the remote for your egg― Nene: %130;Huh? What did you just say? Shuuji: You can't just keep pretending to be a dense anime protagonist whenever you're in trouble. Nene: God... I hate this. I'm going home... Shuuji: You ARE home. Nene: It's not like you think! It's, umm... for when the arousal sometimes comes on especially strongly... I-I don't use it every time! Shuuji: Uh, I never asked you about that. Calm down. Nene: I-It's all that stupid contract's fault! Shuuji: ...Yeah, okay. The contract. Nene: Yes, the contract. Shuuji: ...... Nene: ...... Nene: I can't take this anymore. This can't be happening. This can't be happening. This can't be happening... Death is the only way out now. Shuuji: Calm down. I haven't said anything. Nene: Your look... Your look says it all. It says that I'm a pervert for using an egg vibrator. Shuuji: I'm not thinking anything like that! Shuuji: Though, I WAS wondering why it was still out... Nene: I-It's not like you think! I'm not actually using it right now or anything! I'm not a pervert! Nene: I DID put it away! The egg itself, at least... But apparently I forgot the remote... Shuuji: So, there isn't anything else you forgot to put away, is there? We're all good now, right? Nene: Umm......... Nene: ........................... Nene: W-We're all good! Shuuji: It took you that long to think about it?! And why do you still sound so unsure?! Meguru: How far have you gotten so far? I don't know, since I've been studying the whole time. Nene: We have booked catering for light food, and we have ordered some inexpensive soft drinks over the internet. Nene: As for the party staff, we've discussed it with the Student Council and are currently making a shift plan. There should be no problems there. Nene: We also ordered the decorations on the internet when we ordered the drinks and got permission from the school to store them there upon delivery. Nene: Our overall plan has been to keep costs low by ordering through online stores that have good discounts. We'll only go out and buy the things we overlooked. Meguru: Ooh... Seems like most everything was taken care of while I wasn't paying attention. Touko: Just like I thought, Ayachi-san is very capable. She's so good at this that my help almost seems unnecessary. Nene: That's not true. I'm only able to be this efficient thanks to all the information you gave us. Nene: Except for the program. Meguru: Have we not made any progress there? Touko: We have. Our school's brass band will play at the party. Meguru: But that alone isn't enough? Nene: I wouldn't say that. But it's hard to tell until we actually hold the party. Touko: The party's main guests will be students, so we don't need anything super showy, but it's hard to tell how they'll feel until the party starts. Touko: At least we don't need a full stage schedule like with the cultural festival. Touko: But, just to be on the safe side, it would be better to have something that would fire everyone up with a whoomph.  Tsumugi: With a \"whoomph\"? Meguru: How about cavalry battle? Shuuji: That would certainly liven things up. If it were the sports festival. Meguru: A hotdog eating contest? Shuuji: Why do you keep bringing up typical sports festival events? Meguru: Then, what about a play? Touko: We did consider that. While it works for a cultural festival, wouldn't it be tiring to focus on the stage for too long at a party? Shuuji: Besides, we wouldn't be able to get the Drama Club to put together a show on such short notice. Nene: The third-years have already retired, so the club has their hands full practicing for next spring's cultural festival. Meguru: I see... Oh! Then how about embrace the Halloween theme and, like, do a candy exchange? Meguru: Everyone has to bring some candy, and then they exchange it with each other. Nene: Isn't exchanging sweets something you do on Christmas rather than Halloween? Shuuji: Giving out candy does fit Halloween... Though, that might be a bit daunting if participation is mandatory. Shuuji: Ideally, we want something everyone can participate in at their leisure, and still fun for those who don't participate... Hmmm... Shuuji: Oh, I know! How about a costume contest? Nene: A costume contest? Shuuji: You said that a lot of students wear Halloween costumes at the party, right? Touko: Yeah, a good number of them do every year. Tsumugi: So, you mean make it mandatory this time? Shuuji: No, that's too much to ask for. Shuuji: I'm talking about voting on who put the most effort into their costume, and who looks best in their costume. Meguru: You mean kinda like a beauty contest? Shuuji: Kinda, yeah. Shuuji: It doesn't have to be as grand, though. You'd need to submit your entry, but you wouldn't have to do anything special like presenting yourself on stage. Also, no separate brackets for girls and boys. Shuuji: And, hmm... As for the prizes, maybe something like school cafeteria meal tickets? We can fit that in our budget, right? Nene: Yes, we certainly do have the budget for that... Shuuji: If it's just casting a vote, everyone could participate no problem. Touko: Oh, yes, that's good. That would certainly liven things up. Tsumugi: If there's nothing weird like a swimsuit contest, I feel like a lot of students might participate. Shuuji: Well... I'm worried if we'll get enough participants, actually. Nene: Yeah, I know what you mean. The party could come around only for there to be no one willing to participate. Touko: You don't need to worry about that. There'll be at least five participants. Shuuji: Huh? Do you know anyone who'd participate? Touko: Yup. They're right here. Shuuji: Right here...? Wait, you mean... Shuuji: One...? Meguru: ...Two? Tsumugi: Three? Nene: Four... Touko: And five! Touko: See? We could at least stop the party from getting too awkward if we participate. Shuuji: Ahh, yeah. Touko: Not at all. You're very necessary. You need to show everyone that guys can participate too. Shuuji: Well, I guess that makes sense. Tsumugi: But that means that us five will definitely have to wear costumes, right? Meguru: More or less, yeah. Tsumugi: You... don't seem very bothered by it. Don't you think it's embarrassing? Or maybe you're an avid cosplayer? Meguru: No, it'll be my first time. I mean, it's a little embarrassing... But don't you think costumes will make the party more fun? Meguru: We'll have to help run the party the whole time anyway, so we might as well have fun with it. Tsumugi: Yeah... I guess. Meguru: Besides, it's not like you have to wear some kind of super sexy costume. Meguru: There'll be a lot of other people wearing costumes, so I think it'd be cool to give it a shot as well. Tsumugi: Well... Yeah, you might have a point. Shuuji: Do you not want to wear a costume, Shiiba-san? Tsumugi: I mean... It's not like I don't want to. It just seems like it'd be really embarrassing. Meguru: We'll be wearing costumes together, Tsumugi-senpai! You hardly ever get a chance like this! Tsumugi: ...... Tsumugi: ...A-As long as the costume isn't too revealing. Meguru: Of course. I don't want to dress in anything embarrassing, myself. Touko: Are you also alright with that, Ayachi-san? Nene: Well... If I don't have to wear anything weird that stands out too much, then I have no objections. Meguru: How are we going to get our costumes? Touko: Ah, leave that to me! I'll get costumes for all of us ready. Nene: Huh? But... Touko: Specifically, I want to ask the Fashion Design Club. So you all don't have to worry about your costumes. Tsumugi: Even if it's the Fashion Design Club, won't it be hard for them to prepare this many costumes on such short notice? Touko: It won't be a problem if I ask them now. I'm friends with the club president there, and she's is always talking about how much she likes making clothes for cute girls. Touko: I'm sure she would love to make costumes for you three. She would probably beg me for the honor and would hate me if I didn't ask her. Nene: Okay... Can you take care of that for us, then? Touko: Yup! You bet! Touko: My, this party is starting to sound so fun. Meguru: You said it! Let's make this the best party ever! Touko: Yeah! Nene: Well then, Inaba-san, we better get back to studying so you can actually attend that party. Meguru: Ugh... I'd rather not be reminded... Nene: We were quite productive today, I'd say. Touko: Yeah, we sure were. That was a great study session! Meguru: My head hurts a little from all the concentrating. Nene: Today would be all for naught if you end up forgetting everything. Make sure you review everything if you want it to stick. Meguru: Ugh... I know. Tsumugi: Ayachi-san, thanks for letting us use your apartment. Nene: Don't thank me. I really enjoyed studying together with everyone. Tsumugi: Yeah, I had a ton of fun too! Shuuji: Thanks for helping me study today. Nene: You're very welcome. Usually it's always you helping me out. Touko: Well, Inaba-san, think you can pass your tests now? Meguru: It's hard to say, but... I'll make sure not to waste Nene-senpai's lessons! Nene: I'm hoping for some good results, Inaba-san. Meguru: Y-Yeah... I'll do my best. Shuuji: Anyway, we shouldn't stand around here chatting forever, so... Tsumugi: Right. See you all on Monday, then. Meguru: Thank you for today, Nene-senpai. Touko: Thanks for having us. Shuuji: Have a nice weekend, Ayachi-san. Nene: Thank you. You too. Touko: I need to take the train, so I'm heading this way. Bye-bye. Meguru: See you. Tsumugi: Thanks for all the help today. Touko: Let's try our best to pass our tests too! Until next week. Shuuji: Yeah, see you at school. Enjoy the rest of your weekend. Shuuji: Alright, you both live in the same direction, right? I've already come this far, so I may as well see you two home. Meguru: You don't have to. My place is just around the corner, and Tsumugi-senpai is with me too. We'll be just fine. Tsumugi: Yeah. I'm happy you want to see us home, but don't you live in the other direction? You've already gone out your way for us enough. There's no need to go even more out of the way. Meguru: Okay, so we'll go the rest of the way alone. Bye! Today was a lot of fun. Tsumugi: It really was. Have a nice weekend. Bye-bye. Shuuji: You too. See you two on Monday. Shuuji: ...Welp, time for me to go home as well. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Man, I really am acting strange. I've never really cared about a school event before. Wakana: ...Oh, Hoshina? Shuuji: Kariya? What are you doing here? Wakana: I'm going home from guitar practice. Shuuji: Out practicing this close to midterms, huh? Wakana: Well, you know, I just needed a change of pace. Hahaha... *sigh* Wakana: As if! I'm not brave enough for that. I'm renting a rehearsal studio. Shuuji: Can you do that by yourself? I always figured that was something only bands could do. Wakana: Rehearsal studios come in all shapes and forms. A lot of places rent out small studios for solo practice. That's the kind I'm renting. Wakana: I've got some cash to play around with thanks to my job at the cafe, so sometimes I rent out a rehearsal studio where I can go all out with an amp. Shuuji: You don't do street performance? Wakana: Oh, please. I'm really not brave enough for that. And it seems like it'd be a real pain in the butt. Shuuji: Then how about forming a band? Wakana: I'm just a hobbyist. I mean, sure, I'm getting some decent practice in now that I bought my own guitar, but still. Shuuji: You've been at this for a while, though. It's been a few years, right? Wakana: Well, yeah. It has. Shuuji: Hmm... Shuuji: How about testing the waters a little? Wakana: Huh? What are you talking about? Shuuji: Want to try showing off your guitar skills in front of some fellow students? Wakana: Some fellow students...? What do you mean by that? What're you talking about? "

Meguru: You know, way more people are stopping by for fortune telling than consultations lately. Nene: Yeah, that's true. Tsumugi: Do you get these stretches of no consultations often? Nene: Yeah, we do. A lot of people don't have any serious issues; they just want a push on the back. Tsumugi: Oh, yeah. You're right. I bet that a lot of the time, they've already made up their mind and just want some encouragement. Shuuji: This is probably a good thing, considering the time of the year. Nene: Yeah, midterms are coming up soon. A lot of students probably want to focus on studying, even if they have other things to worry about. Shuuji: I gotta study up myself. Meguru: Wow, Senpai, you take your studying pretty seriously, huh? Shuuji: Well, I didn't have anything else to do other than studying before joining the OC. Tsumugi: You must have pretty good grades then. Shuuji: Nothing worth bragging about. I'm just above average, I'd say. Meguru: ...Tch.

I don't want to think about it. Tsumugi: That reaction tells me everything. You really need to study more. Meguru: Ugh... Shuuji: All club activities will be put on a mandatory break starting next week as midterms near. You should have plenty of time to study.  Meguru: I wouldn't be having this problem in the first place if all I needed was time to study. Shuuji: I know where you're coming from, but you're only hurting yourself by not studying. Meguru: Stop it! You're making way too much sense! I don't wanna hear it! Tsumugi: Ahaha, you can't keep making excuses for yourself. Shuuji: Huh, Koshiji-san? Koshiji: Hi there. Long time no see. Shuuji: Oh, yeah, it's been a while. Thanks for back then. And congrats on becoming president. Koshiji: Ahh... Yeah. I was hoping to forget that, so thanks a lot for bringing it up again.

I know you can do it, Ayachi-san! Nene: Thank you for the compliment, but I really can't. I'm not good at being in front of crowds. Schoolgirl D: *sigh* Okay, I guess there's no changing your mind. Aww man, we could've hit it big... Schoolgirl D: Oh! But if you ever change your mind and wanna step onto the stage again, talk to me first! You gotta! Nene: *sigh* Very well.

Touko: Now, now, this just shows how wonderfully your band played, doesn't it? Nene: Yes, and that's an honor, and I'm truly grateful, but... it's rather draining... Shuuji: In fact, I'm sure it'll be a lot calmer tomorrow, even. The party is still fresh in everyone's minds. Nene: I hope you're right... Meguru: Should we wrap things up here, then? Nene-senpai's looking pretty rough. Tsumugi: They'll be closing the club building soon, so I doubt anyone else is gonna come to us with their problems. Shuuji: There you have it, Ayachi-san. Let's call it a day so you can take it easy. Nene: ...Very well. Thank you for looking out for me. Touko: Helping people is important, but you're not going to be able to help anyone if you get sick. Touko: I'll take over tidying and locking up, so you can go straight home. Nene: ...Are you sure? Touko: Yup, just leave it to me! Nene: Well then, I'll be excusing myself. Thank you, everyone. Touko: Bye-bye～ Make sure you get some rest! Tsumugi: Wait up! I'll go home with you, just in case. Meguru: Oh, I'll come too. What about you, Senpai? Shuuji: I feel bad making Togakushi-senpai tidy up by herself, so I'll stay and help her out. Tsumugi: Bye, then. Shuuji: Yeah, see you later. Touko: See you tomorrow～ Shuuji: ...... Touko: Oh my, what do you mean? I only made a simple observation. Shuuji: You know what you said, and you clearly did it on purpose. Touko: Mufufu. You're blushing, you know? Shuuji: I'm not used to stuff like this... Go easy on me, please. Touko: Okay, my bad. Well, it's getting late, so how about we start locking up? Shuuji: Yeah, let's. Shuuji: But, before that... Could I have a moment? Touko: Of course. There's no rush. Oh, have you decided to talk to me at last? Shuuji: It's more of a request, I guess? Touko: You need something from me? Touko: Oh, is this about your reward? Decided what you wanted, have you? Go on then, let's hear it. Touko: Please, be honest with me. How can I be of service? Shuuji: I'd just like to talk for a minute if you don't mind. Touko: You want to talk? But isn't that what we're doing right now? Or do you mean you want to talk about sex? Like pillow talk? Oh my, you naughty boy. Shuuji: Could you please cut it out with the dirty jokes? Shuuji: I don't want any kind of special conversation. Certainly not one about sex. I just want us to talk normally so I can learn more about you. Shuuji: I mean, yes, there is a reason I want to talk to you, but we don't have to talk about anything specific... A normal conversation will do just fine, really. Touko: You're really serious about this. My bad. I just went and poked fun at you like normal. Shuuji: No, it's fine. I mean, I know this is a bit out of the blue. Touko: What's this about, though? Why do you want to know more about me? Shuuji: Well, you see, errm... There's no big reason behind it. Shuuji: It's just, we're in the same club, but I barely know anything about you. When I realized that, it started to bother me and made me want to do something about it. Touko: Oh, I see. Shuuji: So I just thought we could hang out together a little, or something. Shuuji: So... is that a no, then? Touko: Chatting itself isn't a problem. I don't mind doing that. Shuuji: Oh, well, that's good... Touko: Well, chatting a little isn't much of a reward, is it? It's just a normal, everyday thing. Touko: So it doesn't feel right. Hmm... Oh, I know. Let's go somewhere on our next day off, just the two of us, and talk there. Shuuji: Huh? Just the two of us? Touko: Yeah, that's right. That'll make it nice and easy for us to talk, won't it? Shuuji: D-Do you mean like... Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Yeah, sounds great. Touko: It's settled, then! Your reward for doing a good job with the Halloween party is a date with me. I sound a bit arrogant, putting it that way. Ahaha. Shuuji: N-No, I don't think you did at all. Thank you very much, Senpai. Touko: No problem. Well then, I'm looking forward to our date. Shuuji: I-I'm looking forward to it too. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: A date with Togakushi-senpai... Shuuji: A date... A date, huh? Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Do I even have any good date clothes?! Hideaki: Yo! Shuuji: Hey. Hideaki: What're you doing here so early? Shuuji: Just thinking about things. Hideaki: If something's bothering you, why not go talk to your friends at the OC?

Hideaki: Well, we're both men here. You can talk to me about it! Shuuji: Huh? With you? Kaidou...? Hideaki: What's with that reaction? Don't talk smack until you try! I mean, the drum thing worked out, didn't it? Shuuji: That's true. Shuuji: You're being awfully nice today. Hideaki: That's 'cause it looks like something's really bothering you. And now I wanna know what it is. Shuuji: You're really enjoying this, huh? Hideaki: Kinda? But I'm pretty worried too. I'm not gonna laugh at you, I swear. I'll just give you my opinion. Shuuji: The whole reason I'm hesitant is that I know you'll laugh at me. Hideaki: A date, huh? I see, hmm... Hideaki: ...... Hideaki: Pfft, ahahahaha! Even middle schoolers don't worry about that nowadays! Ahahahaha! Shuuji: I thought you weren't gonna laugh! Hideaki: Sorry, my bad. Couldn't help it. Just didn't expect you to be worrying about a date. Shuuji: I think a lot of people worry about dates, actually. Hideaki: I went out and bought new clothes and everything for it. But I was wearing stuff I wasn't used to, so it went horribly. Shuuji: So, do you think I should dress up properly for a date? Hideaki: I dunno. Like, obviously you have to pay attention to your looks, but... I don't think you need to dress fancy or anything. Hideaki: Especially in your case, Shuuji. It's not like you're going on an actual date, right? So the rules for a normal date don't apply. Shuuji: Yeah... You're right. "

We never chat alone in the clubroom during lunch break, for example. Shuuji: So that really has been weighing on your mind... We didn't talk about anything special there, okay? Meguru: Th-That doesn't make it any less unfair. I'm still just as jealous knowing that! Meguru: Remember what I said yesterday? I just want all of my friendships to be deep. That's why! Shuuji: Hmm... Meguru: But like I just mentioned, Nene-senpai always seems kinda distant, you know? So it's hard to just up and ask her. Meguru: What if she went all, \"You want me to eat lunch with you? Why would I do that?\" I'd die from shock. Shuuji: ...Yeah, that's tough. Shuuji: Okay. I'll do what I can. Meguru: ...!! Shuuji: Err, I think it's a bit early to be thanking me. Meguru: Whatcha mean? Shuuji: While I'd love to help you, I'm not actually sure how I got so close to Ayachi-san. Shuuji: So I don't have a clue where to start. Meguru: What?! Meguru: Th-That's not true! You're like super close! You've even been communicating with eye contact alone! Meguru: That's the whole reason I said this is unfair! Shuuji: Well, I'm glad you think so, but I dunno what to do... Shuuji: Like you said earlier, there's an inherent difference in how we can interact with her since I'm a guy and you're a girl. I doubt my approach would work for you. Meguru: You got close with her in a way only a guy can...? Meguru: W-Wait! Is that why you understand each other so well?! I mean, like, your relationship has gotten ph-ph-physical?! Shuuji: Whoa, whoa! Hold on! You're way off-base! Why are you taking things in that direction?! Meguru: Don't put this on me! You're the one who made it sound like that! Shuuji: I didn't! That was all you! Anyway, just calm down. Let's get some drinks at the vending machine over there. Shuuji: That's what I want to say... *sip* Anyway, that was just a misunderstanding on your part.  Meguru: Yeah, I know. There's no way that'd be true now that I think about it. Shuuji: Would've been nice if you thought that through sooner... Would have saved me some money on the drinks. Meguru: Ah, speaking of, is the milk tea you got any good? I had a hard time deciding between that and this coffee. Shuuji: I'd say it's better than the kind they have at school. Meguru: Hmm... Maybe I should've went with the milk tea instead. Shuuji: Want a taste? Meguru: Of course not! That would be an... i-i-indirect kiss! Shuuji: Oh... Y-Yeah, I guess so. Meguru: Geez, why are you always like this? There's no way a dolt like you could get close with Nene-senpai! Shuuji: Isn't that different from what you said earlier? Meguru: ...So please tell me how you got so close to her while being such a dolt. Shuuji: Err, like I said, I have no idea. Meguru: You are no help at all... Shuuji: Oh, give me a break. Let me think... Meguru: I won't drink that even if you wipe the rim clean. Shuuji: Forget about that already. What I'm saying is... Shuuji: Why not just go and visit Ayachi-san right now? Meguru: ...... Shuuji: And then when you're there, suggest staying the night. Meguru: ...Y-You mean, just me? Shuuji: Of course. You want to get closer to her, right? Meguru: N-No way! Shuuji: You mean you don't want to get closer to her?! Meguru: No, I do! But you want me to stay the night with her?! Meguru: Visiting her by myself would be hard enough for me... Shuuji: And yet you have no qualms hanging out at my place... Meguru: Th-That's because it's you. Meguru: R-Right. Meguru: But, umm, the idea itself is good. Sleeping over at Nene-senpai's place is like a dream for me. Shuuji: Okay, then with that goal in mind, how about you work towards getting closer to her starting tomorrow? Meguru: Ugh... Can I really do this? Shuuji: Well, how about you come and stay over at my place as practice? Meguru: AS IF!! Shuuji: Well, with that settled, let's pick this back up tomorrow. Meguru: O-Okay. See you tomorrow. Meguru: Umm... Thank you, Senpai. Shuuji: You can show your thanks by staying the night at my place. Meguru: What?! Are you serious?! Are you in super-perv Senpai mode right now?! Are you after me or something?! Shuuji: Nah, just kidding. Meguru: You've got a real messed up sense of humor... Taichi: Okay. Take care. Shuuji: ...Good morning. Meguru: Yeah! I figured you'd eventually pass by here. Shuuji: ...Why, though? Meguru: Hey! What kind of reaction is that? Meguru: Didn't you tell me you'd help me yesterday? Shuuji: Oh yeah, I guess that makes sense... Shuuji: Sorry. I was just a little taken aback. Meguru: ...Senpai? Shuuji: Oh, it's nothing. Let's walk while we talk. Meguru: Yeah! Roger that. Shuuji: We'll end up at school in no time if we follow my regular route though. Shuuji: So at the risk of sounding boring, let's take the same detour as yesterday. Shuuji: Should we not have taken a detour? Meguru: No, that was actually a good idea. Meguru: ...It just feels strange heading to school with you. Shuuji: Even though you were waiting to ambush me... Meguru: I-I know. And did you have to put it like that? You make me sound like a bad guy! Shuuji: Anyway, if you have no problem with the detour, then let's get down to business. Shuuji: We need to talk about how you should get closer to Ayachi-san. Meguru: Y-Yeah. Shuuji: So, to make sure, is the goal still being able to sleep over at her place? Meguru: Yeah, we can go with that. Meguru: I kinda got really flustered yesterday, but after thinking about it calmly, it doesn't seem too hard to do. Shuuji: If it's that easy, then can't you do this without my help? Meguru: Th-That's not how I meant it! You can't back out now! You already promised me you'd help! Meguru: Good! Meguru: You know, for how cold you seem, you're surprisingly nice. Shuuji: How am I supposed to take that? Meguru: As a compliment. Shuuji: O-Okay, thanks... Anyhow... Shuuji: The way I see it, getting used to interacting with her is the only way. Meguru: Right. I agree with that. Shuuji: And so, your first step should be― Meguru: Ne... N-N-Nene-senpai! Meguru: Good mornifsh! Nene: It's unusual to see you here in the morning. Meguru: Y-Yesh. Tru dat! Nene: ......?? Meguru: Not at all! Just saying good morninf! Meguru: Hoshina-senpai invited me, so I figured I would swing by... Nene: Okay...? Meguru: Helloha! Nene: ...Yes. Helloha to you as well. Meguru: ...... Nene: ...... "

Student: I should hear them out... Alright, got it. Thank you, Ayachi-san. Student: I'll try to follow your advice. Nene: Okay. Please stop by if you ever need help again. Nene: Thank you. Meguru: You know, way more people are stopping by for fortune telling than consultations lately. Nene: Yeah, that's true. Tsumugi: Do you get these stretches of no consultations often? Nene: Yeah, we do. A lot of people don't have any serious issues; they just want a push on the back. Tsumugi: Oh, yeah. You're right. I bet that a lot of the time, they've already made up their mind and just want some encouragement. Shuuji: This is probably a good thing, considering the time of the year. Nene: Yeah, midterms are coming up soon. A lot of students probably want to focus on studying, even if they have other things to worry about. Shuuji: I gotta study up myself. Meguru: Wow, Senpai, you take your studying pretty seriously, huh? Shuuji: Well, I didn't have anything else to do other than studying before joining the OC. Tsumugi: You must have pretty good grades then. Shuuji: Nothing worth bragging about. I'm just above average, I'd say. Meguru: ...Tch. I always figured you were a slacker who intentionally bombed your tests to get the easier retakes. Shuuji: Wow. How rude. Tsumugi: Are your grades good, Meguru-chan? Meguru: ...Please don't ask. I don't want to think about it. Tsumugi: That reaction tells me everything. You really need to study more. Meguru: Ugh... Shuuji: All club activities will be put on a mandatory break starting next week as midterms near. You should have plenty of time to study.  Meguru: I wouldn't be having this problem in the first place if all I needed was time to study. Shuuji: I know where you're coming from, but you're only hurting yourself by not studying. Meguru: Stop it! You're making way too much sense! I don't wanna hear it! Tsumugi: Ahaha, you can't keep making excuses for yourself. Shuuji: Huh, Koshiji-san? Koshiji: Hi there. Long time no see. Shuuji: Oh, yeah, it's been a while. Thanks for back then. And congrats on becoming president. Koshiji: Ahh... Yeah. I was hoping to forget that, so thanks a lot for bringing it up again.

Shuuji: Ah, sorry.  Nene: I'm sorry... I only participated as a pinch hitter. Schoolgirl D: But you can sing SO good, girl! With you, we could seriously become an international sensation!! Nene: I appreciate your kind words, I do... but I'm really sorry. I have no intention of singing any further. Schoolgirl D: Man, that's a bummer... I was ready to be a star.  Schoolgirl D: But if you ever change your mind, I'm always up for it! I'll wait for you, no matter how long it takes! Nene: U-Uhm, yes... Thank you.  Touko: Here, have some tea. I imagine you must be pretty exhausted.  Nene: Thank you, Togakushi-senpai. Touko: The only thing at home I can do is study, and doing that all day just turns my brain to mush. I'm sure you know that feeling.  Touko: So, if you guys don't mind, would it be alright if I stayed and helped the OC out?  Tsumugi: Only if you count the clubroom. If you count all the people that asked her in the classroom during school, it's way more than three.  Nene: It has been quite the day... Shuuji: ...Definitely. I can tell that just by looking at you. Touko: Well, it'll all die down soon. We just have to wait for word to spread that Ayachi-san won't keep singing.  Meguru: But still, she might get random requests to come fill for people if they lose a vocalist or something. Can't count out that possibility.  Nene: ...I really wouldn't like that. I never even expected to receive this much attention in the first place... It almost makes me wish I hadn't done this.  Touko: And I gotta imagine you'll get another rush of invitations once the cultural festival comes around next year.  Nene: Don't say that, Togakushi-senpai. Now I have to worry about that actually happening.  Touko: Oh, I'm sorry. But still, being prepared for it ahead of time isn't such a bad idea.  Nene: D-Don't worry, I have an excuse. I'll just tell them that the Occult Club is going to be doing a performance.  Shuuji: Let's hope that's enough to dissuade them.  Tsumugi: No need to worry about it now, you have time. A lot of things can change in a year, so you might as well just worry about it when the time comes.  Shuuji: True. We can't really make predictions about events that far off in the future.  Nene: Still... Just thinking about the possibility is enough to make me depressed... *sigh* Touko: How long do you guys usually stay?  Nene: It can vary depending on things, but generally, I would say we leave around six.  Shuuji: Do you wanna just call it a day now? We can do that. I know several of the sports teams end around this time too.  Touko: Good idea. I imagine Ayachi-san wants to go on home and lay down.  Meguru: We don't have to stay if you don't want to, Nene-senpai. Tsumugi: And don't forget, this is a weekday. Don't you want to be well-rested for school tomorrow? Nene: Okay... If you all have no reservations, then I suppose we can end things here for today.  Meguru: Alright, then see you guys tomorrow!  Nene: See you tomorrow. Shuuji: Alright... I got the milk, and I got the kinpira burdock. Clerk: Alright, here you are! That'll be 605 Yen. Shuuji: Here.  Clerk: 605 exactly. Thank you, thank you. Please come see us again. Shuuji: Phew, NOW I'm done. Time to go on home and get some din?Hm? Nene: ...... Nene: Huh? Ah, hello, Hoshina-kun! What are you doing here? Shuuji: Nothing much. Just doing some shopping before dinner. What're you up to?  Shuuji: I noticed you pacing around for some time.  Nene: Y-You just stood there and watched? Why didn't you come up and say something sooner... Shuuji: Sorry, I was just a little confused, so I wound up staring. Are you out grocery shopping too? Nene: No, not quite. Today was pretty exhausting for me, so I was thinking of maybe going somewhere... Shuuji: Ah, yeah, I feel that. Sometimes you just don't wanna bother with whipping up something yourself.  Shuuji: ...Ramen? Nene: I told you not to look... Shuuji: S-Sorry. But really, I don't see anything to be embarrassed about.  Nene: You really don't think it's... strange or anything? You can't tell me a girl eating at a ramen restaurant all by herself doesn't weird you out.  Shuuji: Oh no, not at all. I don't see anything wrong with it. Nene: O-Oh, well thank you. Nene: It's not something I love, per se... but I've been curious to explore it.  Nene: Do you remember that day when you and I went with Inaba-san to the conveyor-belt sushi restaurant? Shuuji: Yeah, I do.  Nene: Well, it's much the same scenario... I've never actually been to a ramen restaurant before.  Shuuji: Is that so? Shuuji: You're getting cold feet?  Nene: That's right... I looked in and only saw men dining there, so I got scared.  Nene: But the thing is, I'm not sure I'll ever work up the courage to do this again if I walk away... Shuuji: Is trying this ramen that important to you?  Nene: ...Yes. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Umm... would you like me to come with you? Maybe that would help. Nene: Ah, er, wait... I thought you were going to be eating dinner at home.  Shuuji: Nah, it's all good. None of it'll get cold. Shuuji: And all this talk of ramen's gotten me a little curious... You wouldn't mind if I joined you, would you?  Shuuji: Absolutely. Ready to go on in? Nene: Yes! Shuuji: Coming.  Nene: Ramen! Oh, Ramen! Nene: It'll be my first time having real ramen instead of the cheap, instant kind. I can't wait to see how it tastes. Nene: Is that some sort of problem, perhaps?  Shuuji: Well, before we go in, let me check with you: are you aware of what kind of place this is?  Nene: Come again? I thought it was a ramen place. Is it not? Really? But I'm sure I― Shuuji: Weeell, you could SAY it's a ramen place, but that's not quite the full picture... Let's just say it's a bit of special place. Nene: Oh, you don't have to worry about that. I've done my research prior to coming here.  Shuuji: Really?  Nene: Yes. I have it all down pat. Shuuji: Yeah, a few times with Kaidou.  Shuuji: Ah, yes. Just us two.  Clerk: We got two free seats together, so come on and follow me.  Shuuji: Are you ready, Ayachi-san? Nene: Yes! Clerk: How's it goin', y'all! Shuuji: What are you getting? Nene: The extra large char siu. Shuuji: The extra large?  Nene: Am I not allowed to?  Shuuji: Well, you are, but it's gonna be a lot of food. You sure you can handle it?  Nene: Absolutely. It might seem surprising, but I'm actually a large eater.  Shuuji: Oh, really?  Shuuji: ...Are you sure about that? Nene: Huh? Clerk: Er, yeah, absolutely, miss... W-We'll have that out to ya.  Shuuji: A-Ayachi-san, what are you DOING?! Nene: What? Is something the matter?  Shuuji: A-Are you sure you want that? Like, are you REALLY sure you want that?  Nene: Well... is that not the special code that you chant when ordering it? I read on the internet that first-timers should simply stick to ordering it that way. Shuuji: Man oh man... You actually believed that... Nene: Now it's only a matter of time before it comes out and I get to eat it! Oh, I wonder what it'll taste like... I'm so excited♪ Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Yeah, we've already ordered and everything.  Nene: I feel a little bad. My apologies. But still, I'm glad our path's crossed.  Shuuji: Y-You are...? Nene: Absolutely. I've been eager to eat at this place for so, so long. Nene: Plus enjoying meals with others is something I seldom get the chance to do. It's always nice to have company.  Shuuji: O-Ohh... yeah. Shuuji: Yeah, I'm all good.  Shuuji: That exciting for you?  Nene: Oh, yes! I've had my eyes on this restaurant for so, sooo long. But I could never bring myself to come, you see. Nene: Just to put my frustration into perspective for you, if I had waited a tad bit longer, it might've been possible to retrieve fragments from me. Shuuji: Eh, I don't know, that sounds like a bit of an exaggeration.  Nene: I guarantee you it's not. I'm genuinely happy.   Nene: But, just so you know... If you don't want to stay here with me, you don't have to. You're free to leave anytime.  Shuuji: I don't mind. And if anything, I enjoy hanging out with you.  Nene: Huh...?! Umm, what did you― Shuuji: A-Ah, uhm! I just meant that, like, when I'm with you I don't have to worry about my secret, so it makes me feel relaxed, I guess? Or comfortable? Something like that.  Nene: Ah, yes, of course. Don't worry, I fully understand what you're trying to say.  Nene: And also, I enjoy hanging out with you too, Hoshina-kun.  Shuuji: ―――! Nene: ...... Nene: A-Also, I think I ought to thank you. You've really helped me out in a variety of ways.  Shuuji: Oh, no, I'm not looking for thanks. Really, I should be the one apologizing, considering you still haven't gotten back all your fragments.  Nene: No, that's perfectly alright. They are coming back, slowly but surely.  Nene: Ah! It's finally here♪ I finally get to taste real ramen♪ Shuuji: ...... Nene: Umm... What is this?  Shuuji: An extra large char siu ramen with noodles firm and spicy, extra veggies, and extra extra garlic oil. Nene: But, the thing is, I don't see the noodles. Where are they? Shuuji: Beneath that mountain of vegetables somewhere. Nene: ...This isn't ramen like I know it.  Shuuji: Well, this isn't regular ramen. It's the \"Taroumaru\" style of ramen.  Nene: Ramen... Nene: Ah, goodness! I can't mope around like this; That would be a definite breach of the sacred ramen etiquette! I have to start eating.  Shuuji: What?! Sacred ramen etiquette?! Nene: No. I was the one who ordered it, so I'll eat all of it. Well then, without further ado.  Shuuji: Well, at first, yeah. Oh, and you ate the vegetables. That's not part of the ramen.  Shuuji: True.  Shuuji: %130;HOW IN―?! Guest A: Yer frickin' kidding... That lass ate everything, even the soup... Guest B: And she's as slim as a twig?! Guest C: But boy is she a looker... Help, boys, I'm fallin' in love! Nene: D-Do you need something? You're staring at me, and it's making me rather embarrassed.  Nene: Is there something on my face, perhaps?  Shuuji: No, not that. I was just wondering, like... how does that slim body of yours even hold all that food... Guest A: Who IS that girl, seriously?! Guest B: Man, I don't even think I'd be able to eat all that.  Guest C: ...I wanna have an eating contest with her! Nene: ......? The other customers seem to be talking amongst themselves about something. Do you know why?  Shuuji: Probably. They just witnessed the birth of a new legend.  Nene: Huh... A legend, you say...? Nene: That and then some. It was simply delicious. But, ugh... I think I may have overeaten just a little bit.  Shuuji: Just a LITTLE...? Nene: My stomach's so full I might not be able to fit anything else in the rest of the day. It was very worthwhile coming here. Nene: And, of course, I have to thank you for accompanying me.  Shuuji: My pleasure.  Nene: Thanks to you, this won't be nagging at my chest anymore... I feel relieved. Guest B: And she ate so gracefully too... Damn, I'm a jealous man.  Guest C: I wanna challenge her to an eat-off.  Nene: I don't know why... but I feel like we're drawing a lot of attention.  Shuuji: Ah... yeah... Nene: Come on. Shuuji: I-I'm coming... Shuuji: What do you mean?  Nene: Well, so many people were staring at me... So I had the idea that maybe I'd done something disrespectful or rude.  Shuuji: No, you didn't do anything wrong. They were looking at you out of admiration. Nene: But for what reason? All I did was eat a bowl of ramen.  Shuuji: That was no ordinary bowl of ramen, though.  Nene: ......? I'm still somewhat confused, but it's good to know that they at least weren't angry at me, or sneering at me.   Shuuji: Oh, I forgot to ask. How's your stomach? Does it hurt any?  Nene: No, it feels quite fine. The only thing my chest is full of right now is joy and content *siigh*... Nene: What's wrong, Hoshina-kun? Shuuji: Ah, nothing. Glad to hear you liked it; I enjoyed mine too. It was a pretty fun time, all things considered.  Nene: I feel the same. Really, though... It feels like I have fun whatever I'm doing when you're there too.  Shuuji: Wh-Where'd that come from... Could you explain that a little more?  Nene: Well, we have many more members in the club now, and I got to go to the ramen place I've been longing to try. It's just been new experiences day after day... I enjoy my life a lot more.  Shuuji: R-Really? Nene: Yes. That's the honest truth.  Shuuji: Come to think of it, it's the same for me. I've made so many new experiences since joining the club. Hanging out with girls outside of school, participating in a school event, and so on and so forth.  Shuuji: My life would've been a million times duller if I hadn't made the decision to be more social and outgoing.  Nene: Huh? Oh, hardly. I haven't done anything quite that special.  Shuuji: Oh, but you have. Also, not as a repayment or anything, but if you ever feel scared to go someplace alone again... Just ask me, and I'll gladly come with you.  Nene: ...Er, umm... but... Nene: ...... Nene: Can I... hold you to that, then? Shuuji: Of course. Just hit me up whenever.  Nene: Thank you! Haha.  Shuuji: Of course, that's only if you don't mind me tagging along.  Nene: Why would I mind? Remember what I just told you? Every moment is fun when I'm with you.  Shuuji: O-Oh, uh, thanks. Shuuji: I'm in the same boat as you. Ever since I joined the OC, and became friends with you, I've been having so much fun. Nene: ―――! Nene: Th-Thank... you... Nene: Y-Yes. We ended club early today so I could go home and get rested up. It would be disrespectful to the rest of the club members if I stayed out late wandering around town.  Shuuji: Huh? Nene: Look, over there. That has to be her.  Shuuji: Oh, you're right. Shuuji: Yeah, better not disturb them if they're on a date.  Nene: Let's hurry and be on our way before she sees us.  Shuuji: That's the smartest idea, yeah.  Shuuji: Good to hear.  Nene: Make sure you get a good night's rest too, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Sure thing. Well, Ayachi-san, see you at school tomorrow. Goodnight.  Nene: Goodnight.  Nene: ...... Nene: Ack!! Wh-What did I just SAY?! "

You used to have the eyes of a dead fish, but now you've passed the point of a resurrected fish all the way to a bouncy, fresh fish. Shuuji: Er, sorry, but I have no idea what you're saying... Taichi: Ah! Something nice must've happened, huh? I see how it is. Maybe you're the fisherman, and you caught someone? You snagged a bouncy, fresh fish for yourself? Shuuji: No, I haven't! Could you stop teasing me first thing in the morning? That's messed― Shuuji: Oh... Give me a moment. I got a text. Shuuji: I've hardly ever used them before, so I don't have a clue what I'm doing― Taichi: Heh... *grin* Shuuji: Ah?! I-It's not like that, Dad! Taichi: Don't worry about me, Son. You meeting up with someone? Or are you having lunch together? Shuuji: Ugh... A-Anyway, I'm sorry but I gotta go now! I'll do the laundry after school, so just leave it be for now! Taichi: Sure. See you later. And good luck! Meguru: Ah! Senpai! Helloha! Shuuji: Pheew... G-Good morning. Meguru: You're breathing pretty heavily. Did you run all the way here? Shuuji: N-No, I didn't. Meguru: Ahaha... Yeah, I just felt like it when I woke up this morning. Meguru: And Senpai, what was up with that emoticon...? Pfft, that made it seem like you were all flustered. Shuuji: Oh, yeah... My bad, Inaba-san. I wanted to use one since you did, but I don't know jack about emoticons... Meguru: ...... Shuuji: H-Huh? Inaba-san? Meguru: *stare* Shuuji: Inaba―Ah! Shuuji: Sorry! Umm... Meguru. Meguru: That's right! I almost thought you forgot already. Meguru: But I'll forgive you since you remembered in the end. Let's go, Senpai! Shuuji: ...Huh? We're going this way again? Meguru: Of course. This way has just become that kinda way for us, you know? Shuuji: That kinda way...? You mean like, a way just for us, so we can talk? Meguru: Haha, actually saying that out loud is so lame. Shuuji: It's really hard to get what sets you off and what doesn't, you know that?! Meguru: I don't know what you're talking about. Meguru: ...Umm, by the way, Senpai. Shuuji: Huh? Wh-What's up? Meguru: You know, there's actually something I'd like to ask of you. That's partly why I texted you. Shuuji: Yeah? What is it? Meguru: You remember how I told you all that stuff on the way home last Friday? Shuuji: Ah... Shuuji: Huh? You mean... Meguru: Umm... From Nene-senpai and the others, I mean. Shuuji: Huh? Go on... Meguru: How do I put this... More importantly than that... Meguru: I just, well... I only want you to know. Shuuji: ...... Meguru: I'm not really sure why myself... Ahaha, yeah... Shuuji: ...Got it. I'll keep it to myself. Meguru: Ah... Shuuji: (I mean, even putting that aside...) Shuuji: (...Sorry, Meguru. I know I just promised you, but...) Shuuji: Yeah, thanks. Shuuji: Well, the thing is... Shuuji: (Do you two know anyone who could search for someone?) Shuuji: (Yeah. I'm trying find someone who went missing.) Nene: (...Is this somehow related to Inaba-san's fragments?) Tsumugi: (Oh, right. Ayachi-san told me about that. That's why you've been so concerned with Meguru-chan lately, right?) Shuuji: (Yeah... That's right.) Shuuji: (I'll give you the details later, but it seems like she her best friend disappeared and she doesn't know where she is.) Tsumugi: (...Really?) Shuuji: (She left without saying goodbye... I think the incident left her scarred. Now I want to find that friend of hers.) Tsumugi: (Oh... She went through all that?) Nene: (...Okay. I understand.) Nene: (I don't know anyone with people finding skills, but I'll at least ask who I can for now.) Tsumugi: (Oh, I'll help out too. Not just because of the fragments. I want to help Meguru-chan.) Shuuji: (Thanks. I really appreciate it.) Tsumugi: (Also, is it okay to tell Togakushi-senpai about this too? She knows a lot of people, so she could be really helpful.) Shuuji: (Yeah, would be great if you could. I can definitely see her being a big help.) Tsumugi: (I'm sure she will! Okay, I'll ask her.) Shuuji: (But one more thing. I would like you to keep this all from her for now.) Nene: (...Why is that?) Shuuji: (Umm... The truth is, she asked me to keep it a secret. Said she doesn't want anyone but me to know since it's embarrassing to her.) Tsumugi: (Oh?) Shuuji: (Besides, we might not be able to find the girl. I don't want to disappoint her or anything. So I'd really appreciate it if you kept quiet about this until we know more.) Nene: (...Alright. Understood.) Tsumugi: (But... Hey, Ayachi-san. This is definitely how I think it is, right?) Nene: (I think so. I can't see it any other way.) Shuuji: (...Huh? What're you talking about?) Tsumugi: (Ahaha, you can be so dense about this stuff.) Tsumugi: (Isn't it obvious? Meguru-chan actually―) Meguru: Excuse me! Tsumugi: Ah?! Meguru: Oh, you're all together! Meguru: Do you really have to ask? I came to hang out. Meguru: Alright! Don't mind me. Meguru: Hey, Nene-senpai, Tsumugi-senpai! I've come over to chat! Shuuji: ...... Tsumugi: H-Huh? With us, you mean? Meguru: You bet. We haven't seen each other or talked since Friday. Meguru: Oh, I'm not bothering you by coming, am I? Tsumugi: N-No! Not at all. Meguru: Ahaha, great! I'm happy to hear that. Nene: Is it okay to ignore Hoshina-kun like that, though? Shuuji: Huh? O-Oh, uh... Meguru: (...! ...!) Tsumugi: I'm pretty sure he didn't say anything... Meguru: Senpai, Senpai. You don't mind, do you? Shuuji: Nah, it's okay, Meguru. If you've come to see the two of them, then I'll let you guys be. Nene, Tsumugi: ...... Meguru: No one said you had to go away or anything. You can stay and watch in silence. Shuuji: Isn't this just bullying?! Meguru: Not at all! I'm just asking you to kindly watch over me. Shuuji: Ugh... Okay, enough with the puppy-dog eyes, Meguru. Meguru: What's the matter? Please watch over me, Senpai! Hideaki: Uh, excuse me. Comment from the peanut gallery, here. Meguru: Huh?! Wh-What the! Wh-Wh-What is it?! Hideaki: Okay, so... Ahem. Hideaki: Isn't Shuuji the only one you're chatting with?! Meguru: Ah... Wakana: Ah, sorry for butting in. I'm Kariya Wakana, and this guy is Kaidou Hideaki. We're Hoshina's friends. Meguru: O-Oh! I'm Inaba Meguru. Wakana: Anyway... Ahem. Wakana: Hoshina, since when have you been calling her by her first name without honorifics?! Shuuji: Ah... Tsumugi: Yes! That's right! I was just thinking that! Nice one, Kariya-san! Nene: So was I. I think we all were wondering about that. Up until now, he has been calling her by her last name with an honorific... Meguru: Ah, er, umm, about that, it's like...! Meguru: Huh? Ah, er... Shuuji: We've become pretty good friends, so I asked if I could start using her first name. Shuuji: And, well, a plain and simple \"Meguru\" without honorifics is what felt right to me, so I just went with that. Hideaki: Huh... I see. Gotta say, that's not like you. Shuuji: Yeah, you're not wrong. But I've never had a junior in a club before, so... Wakana: It didn't feel right treating her like an underclassman forever? Kinda like how they do it in sports clubs. Didn't know you had that side to you, Hoshina. Shuuji: Is there something wrong with that? It's not like this girl holds anything back like a typical underclassman. Wakana: Yeah, I can see that. She seems kinda over-familiar... Oh, sorry, I didn't mean that in a bad way. She just seems quite attached with how she's all \"Senpai, Senpai!\" Nene: So nothing special happened between you two that led to you calling her by her first name? Tsumugi: That's kind of a bummer... Shuuji: Y-Yeah, nothing special happened! Right, Meguru? Meguru: Huh?! D-Dat's right! Shuuji: Anyway, isn't it about time for you to head back to your classroom? Lunch break is almost over. Meguru: Ah... Oh yeah! I'll do that! Meguru: I-I'm leaving then! See you all later! Meguru: So I thought, next time I should have you come over to my place instead. Shuuji: I can't turn you down when you put it like that. Shuuji: Well, we're both ditching club for the day to do this... Meguru: But Nene-senpai said that it was okay. Shuuji: Yeah, I guess. Shuuji: (......) Shuuji: (I'm trying my best to ignore that delicious bittersweet taste from earlier.) Shuuji: Huh, you live pretty close to the station. Meguru: We could have passed through the shopping district to get to my place too, but I thought it'd be better to take a route that's easier to remember. Shuuji: ...Does that mean there is going to be a second time? Meguru: Why do you always have to ask these things out loud? Seriously, Senpai... Man. Shuuji: Wh-What's so bad about it? That's just how important it is. Meguru: O-Oh, it's important? Shuuji: Sure is. At least to me. Meguru: ...You don't ever change, do you? Shuuji: What's that supposed to mean? Meguru: Ah, we have to turn the corner here. Shuuji: Oh... Meguru: We're there. This is my house. Shuuji: Huh? Sure... Meguru: I'm baaack! Shuuji: It's about damn―Bueeh?! Shuuji: ...... Meguru: Senpai, you should see the look on your face right now. Shuuji: I mean, it didn't even cross my mind that you'd make me wait just to change again... Meguru: I like to kick back and relax at home, so I went ahead and changed into something more comfortable. Shuuji: Then why didn't you come to meet me in those clothes?!  Meguru: Because this way I get to surprise you. I knew you'd never expect me to change a second time. Shuuji: This was seriously all part of your plan? You sure went out of your way... Meguru: Really, though, this is loungewear. I can't wear this stuff outside. Meguru: So, what do you think? Surprised? Shuuji: Yeah, I really didn't expect you to change a second time. Though, your new getup is surprising too. You give off a completely different vibe than usual in that outfit. Meguru: That's right. Hehe. That surprise you too? Well, you had no way of knowing since I never told you. Meguru: Do the glasses make a big difference?  Shuuji: Hmm... They do make you look more plain than usual. Meguru: This is how I always looked before entering Himematsu. Shuuji: ...You mean, before your makeover? Meguru: Yep! Standing before you is an elusive Meguru that hardly anyone else gets to see. Meguru: It's gotten kinda embarrassing to show myself in public like this now. I look way too plain. I don't want to come off as a slob. Shuuji: ...But you're okay looking like this in front of me? Meguru: Hehehe. I'm making an exception for you. Your reactions are worth it! Meguru: I'd like you to keep this a secret as well. Shuuji: Y-Yeah, sure... Shuuji: That's a pretty sweet weapon, but I'm a lance player. Not like getting that gun would do me any good. Meguru: What the heck? Why aren't you jealous?! Meguru: Well, whatever. I know you'll think differently after Lavie here saves your butt with her shiny new weapon.  Shuuji: Guh. Well, yeah, I'm pretty much relying on you to carry me... as always... Shuuji: Gotta say, though. Playing with each other while sitting face-to-face is a completely different experience. Meguru: Right? This way you won't get horrifically murderized when you try to thank me! Shuuji: You didn't have to bring that up again, Lavie-san! Meguru: Sorry, but it was too funny. I don't think I'll ever forget how you just stopped and got your face kicked in. Shuuji: I was actually moved by how skilled yet kind the mysterious Lavie-san was... I was shocked when I saw who was behind the character. Meguru: What the heck? I'm not any different from Lavie! Just look at how good she is at coordinating her outfit. Shuuji: Can't deny that. That armor set is pretty dang cool. Meguru: I know, right?! I had to do so much grinding to get the whole set. Hehe! Shuuji: The hair and armor colors even match. It's kinda hot, or more like sexy... Nice job. Meguru: How could you say that to the person playing the character? Gross. Shuuji: I was just trying to compliment your fashion sense, since you seem to take pride in that... Meguru: Ugh... Meguru: Th-Then you should say that about me instead. Shuuji: Huh? Meguru: Don't \"huh\" me! What's with that answer? Don't you want to compliment me? Meguru: Lavie's player is, umm... confident about her own fashion as well... Shuuji: Oh, you look pretty sexy too. Meguru: Buh?! Wh-Wh-Wh-What're you saying?! Shuuji: Well, just look at how you're always showing off your legs... Meguru: M-M-Maybe, but... we're talking about my fashion sense! Not my legs! Shuuji: But going with bare legs is an intentional decision, isn't it? That's a conscious fashion choice. Meguru: Okay, true! But still! Ahh, geez! Shuuji: When I first saw you at school, I thought you looked like a bit of a floozy. But on closer inspection, it's really more of a casual cute style. Meguru: ...... Shuuji: I can tell you put some serious thought into picking a jumper that would match with your uniform. You give off a vibrant, playful vibe, like that of a younger girl. It's really fitting for you. Meguru: Y-Yeah? Ehehe, I spent a lot of time coordinating that outfit. It's my pride and joy♪ Meguru: Senpai, Senpai, praise me more! Shuuji: Sorry, but that's all I got. I'm having trouble remembering anything else to say from the fashion magazines I flipped through... Meguru: ...There goes most of the goodwill you just garnered. Shuuji: You're pretty easy to flatter, huh? Meguru: And there goes the rest. Shuuji: Sorry, I went a little too far there... Meguru: Whatever. Let's just go and do a quest. Shuuji: Oh, okay... I guess I'll back you up... Meguru: Pfft, haha... You don't have to act so depressed. Shuuji: Ah, you cheering up again? Meguru: Geez, I don't believe you. Yeah, I'll cheer up and shoot you full healing bullets～ Shuuji: Huh? Did you make these just for me...? Meguru: No, I made them yesterday. I was just in the mood for it. Shuuji: Ah... Still, though. Thanks. I'll dig right in. Meguru: Yeah, go ahead! Shuuji: ...Oh, this is great! It's sweet and sour, but also has a slightly bitter aftertaste. I really like it. Meguru: Oh, awesome! Meguru: Hearing everyone's impression is the best part of making any dessert. Shuuji: No, really, you're seriously good at this. Every treat of yours I've eaten has been delicious. Shuuji: You're a pretty good cook in general, aren't you? Like in MonHun, you've got quite a few hidden talents. Meguru: Oh, thank... Well, umm... Meguru: I guess you could say I'm a bit of a homebody. I tend to spend most of my free time at home. Shuuji: Oh, I see. That makes sense... Meguru: Yeah, basically. Shuuji: What kind of books do you like? The genres on your shelf seem all over the place. Meguru: Good question... I don't have specific preferences. I read pretty much everything. Shuuji: Huh... Got any examples? Meguru: The last thing I read was an Irish poem collection. Before that was some celebrity's street food travelogue, and before that an isekai harem light novel, I think? Shuuji: Holy crap, that spread... You'll read just about anything, huh? Meguru: Lately though I've been playing games a lot more than reading. I play stuff other than MonHun too. Shuuji: Yeah, I see the console. Oh... l-looks like you're into otome games. Meguru: Heck yeah. With headphones on! Those sexy male voices make my heart pound in ways that― Meguru: Wait, how did you know?! Shuuji: Err, there's what looks like one laying out in the open over there... Meguru: Huh?! Aaah! I-I forgot to put it awaaay! Shuuji: I-It's okay! I play that kinda stuff too! Meguru: What?! You're a guy who plays otome games?! Shuuji: No, I tend to play games aimed at guys... Meguru: For guys...? Y-You mean porn games? Ugh, you actually play that filth? You're the worst... Shuuji: What an absurd double standard. Don't just assume that any visual novel for guys is an adult PC game! There's a lot of perfectly normal stuff on consoles! Shuuji: Wait, why do you even know about those kinds of games...? Meguru: Uhh... Shuuji: You actually play those, don't you?! Meguru: I-I do not! How dare you suggest that?! I've had enough of your super-perv antics! Shuuji: Don't pretend like you're not accusing me of the same thing! This is such a double standard! Shuuji: No, thank you. For the tart, and― Meguru's Mom: Oh my, you're going home already? Meguru: Wha?! Shuuji: Oh, uh, yes! Thanks for having me! Meguru: M-Mom!! Why did you come out?! Meguru's Mom: This is the first friend you've brought over in so long. Of course I'd want to say hello! Meguru's Mom: And it's a boy too? How exciting! Meguru: Geez! I thought I told you to stay clear! Besides, you're getting the wrong idea! Meguru: It's not like you think! He's just an upperclassman from my club! Meguru's Mom: Thank you for taking care of my daughter. Ahh, I wish my husband was here to see you too... Meguru: Mooom! Geeez! Shuuji: Er, I really need to go now! You'll have to let me off for today! Thanks again! Shuuji: ...... Nene: Huh? Is that you, Hoshina-kun? Shuuji: Oh... Hey there, Ayachi-san. On your way home? Nene: Yes. The sun was setting, so we called it a day. Nene: Weren't you supposed to be somewhere with Inaba-san? Shuuji: Yeah, but we called it a day for the same reason. Nene: I see... Shuuji: Yeah... Nene: ...... Nene: I've got some news, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Ah... Wh-What is it? Nene: It seems that Togakushi-senpai is willing to help us. Shuuji: Huh? You mean... Nene: About Inaba-san's missing friend. Shuuji: ...... Nene: Since Inaba-san's friend was her classmate, Togakushi-senpai said she would get in touch with some people she knows from the schools near their old one and have them check the student registers there. Shuuji: I see... Nene: ...Hoshina-kun? Shuuji: Yeah... Meguru: \"I'd like you to keep this a secret as well.\" Shuuji: (But if there's a thorn still stuck in her heart, I want to remove it for her.) Shuuji: \"W-Well, yeah... We do...\" Meguru: \"So I feel a certain kinship with you.\" Shuuji: Are you free right now? This would be a good time for me to share the details. "

Meguru: They turned out pretty well, I think. Alright, here you go, Tsumugi-senpai! Tsumugi: Wow♪ Thanks～ Meguru: Togakushi-senpai, here's yours! Touko: Ooh♪ This is such a wonderful surprise. Thank you. Nene: Can I try one as well? Meguru: Of course you can! I made a ton of 'em. There's no way I'd leave you out!  Meguru: So here, take one! Nene: Thank you very much. I'll have a taste. Shuuji: Oh... Thanks. A girl's homemade cupcake, huh... Meguru: I'm sure you'll like it. Shuuji: You've been pretty cheerful lately, I have to say. Meguru: Yeah, thanks to you. Tsumugi: Oh! It's great, Meguru-chan! Meguru: Really? I'm glad you like it! Touko: It's so moist and fluffy. You didn't just use some pre-packaged mix, right? I can tell you put some real effort into these. The nuts are a great touch. Nene: It's really good, Inaba-san. This tastes just as good as the stuff they sell at bakeries.  Meguru: Wow! Nene-senpai, that's so nice of you to say! Nene: Sh-Shouldn't you sit and eat your own share? Meguru: Oh, well, maybe you should feed me. Just kidding! Nene: ...? What's the matter, Inaba-san? Meguru: Oh, nothing! Meguru: Okay, I'll eat mine now. Nene: Alright, let's call it a day here. Tsumugi: 'Kay! Meguru: Ahaha. You're welcome. Shuuji: Welp, time to head home. Meguru: Ah, Senpai, Senpai. Meguru: Are you free after this? Shuuji: I guess, yeah. Meguru: Then, well... let's go home together! Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Umm... Is this another cupcake? Meguru: Y-You don't want it? Shuuji: Of course I do! I was just surprised. Shuuji: Umm... You went out of your way to make me an extra one? Meguru: ...Well, you're the one I made that promise with. Shuuji: Y-Yeah, I guess. Shuuji: Oh... Meguru: I-I'm the one thanking you, here. Meguru: Come on. Hurry up and eat it. Go, go. Shuuji: Yeah, thanks. I can't wait! Shuuji: No, you did good! It's just a little messy because I can't stop smiling while I eat. Meguru: ...... Shuuji: *munch* *munch* Yeah, it's great. This tastes awesome, Inaba-san. Meguru: ...E-Ehehehe. Meguru: Ah! Now you're making me smile and laugh too, geez! Shuuji: Huh? How is that my fault? Meguru: 'Cuz what kind of dope smiles while they eat? Meguru: You're welcome. Shuuji: Though, to be honest... I wish I had something to drink along with it. It tasted great, but now my mouth is dry. Meguru: Oh... Y-You're right! I'm sorry I didn't think of that! Meguru: Umm, there's a vending machine down the side street we talked on the other day, right? Let's go! Shuuji: Nah, no need to take a detour just for that. I was only half serious, anyway. Meguru: Oh, okay, right... Meguru: Yeah...? Shuuji: I'll take that detour after all. Wanna tag along? I wouldn't mind chatting more with you. Meguru: Ah... Meguru: Yeah! Of course! Meguru: There we go. Meguru: Hm? What's wrong, Senpai? Shuuji: Oh, nothing. Shuuji: For sure. Meguru: That's good. I was afraid you wouldn't want to eat any of my treats anymore. Shuuji: I'd never turn down more treats from you. It'd be awesome if I could have more sometime. Meguru: Roger that. Next time I'll make something easier to eat. Meguru: So... What did you want to talk about now?  Shuuji: Hm? Meguru: Don't \"hm\" me! Didn't you just say you wanted to chat some more? Shuuji: O-Ohh... Right... Meguru: You want to know? Shuuji: Yeah. After getting this involved, I'm kinda curious. I haven't heard any of the details yet. Meguru: Hmm, let's see... Meguru: Nene-senpai kept chatting away about nothing in particular. Shuuji: Oh yeah? Meguru: Other than that, I made dinner to show my thanks for letting me sleep over... Meguru: Oh, right! We also took a bath together! And even better, it was Nene-senpai who invited me for that! Meguru: And before you ask, we didn't wash each other or anything. But man, Nene-senpai has such a nice figure and pretty skin. I'm a girl and was still totally captivated. It's not fair how she gets to be both slender and voluptuous. Shuuji: Y-You don't say... Meguru: Hey, I know that look! You're picturing her right now, aren't you?! You perv! Shuuji: You can't blame me after you're the one who said all that stuff. Shuuji: Erm, I was picturing you this time. Meguru: WHAT?! Wh-Why me?! Meguru: Why would you imagine ME naked?! Compared to Nene-senpai, I'm basically flat! Shuuji: Well, I think you're both really attractive. A flat girl like you can still be hot! Meguru: ―――?! Shuuji: Err, sorry! This has been really rude of me! Forget I said anything! Meguru: W-Will do. I'll try my best! You... You see, jokes like that don't faze me one bit! Shuuji: Huh? R-Right... Meguru: R-Right! Nene-senpai was worried about whether I'm getting along with my classmates!  Shuuji: Ahh... Meguru: Y-Yeah. True, we took a bath together, ate cake together and all that... Meguru: ...... Shuuji: ...Inaba-san? Meguru: I'm sure you're curious about that too, huh? Shuuji: Huh? A-About what? Meguru: About why I decided to get a makeover when entering Himematsu. Shuuji: Well... Meguru: Yeah. Our conversation ended up there. Meguru: I didn't tell her anything. Shuuji: Huh? Meguru: It's a hard subject for me, so I just sorta glossed over it. Shuuji: ...... Meguru: But it makes me wonder if it's been weighing on her mind. And if it's been weighing on your mind as well... Shuuji: Umm...  Didn't you tell us before that you got a makeover to make yourself more approachable? Meguru: I did, and it's true, but I'm talking about what made me want to do that in the first place. Shuuji: O-Oh. Yeah... Meguru: ...... Meguru: Ah... Meguru: O-Okay. It's not a very enjoyable story, though... Ahaha... Shuuji: I don't mind. I'm just happy that you're willing to tell me. Meguru: ...Thank you. Shuuji: Alright. Go ahead. Meguru: She may have been my only one, but we were really close. We were best friends. Shuuji: ...You didn't have any other friends? Meguru: You know how clingy I can be, right? Well, back then, it was even worse. Meguru: I could be myself around Chi-chan, but not any of the other girls... Shuuji: Chi-chan, huh? Meguru: Yeah. Kizuki Chihoko. I always called her Chi-chan. Meguru: She was a very frail and quiet girl. She was a huge bookworm, though, and was super smart. Meguru: I did nothing but read books too, so we had a shared hobby and matching personalities. Meguru: I could tell her all the things that I couldn't tell anyone else. I told her everything... Meguru: ...But maybe that was the problem. Meguru: To make things worse, I tend to jabber on incessantly when I get excited. Meguru: Basically, I'm completely unfettered when it comes to everyone I'm close with... Shuuji: Yeah, I can see that. Meguru: ...... Meguru: Chi-chan stopped coming to school all of a sudden. Shuuji: Huh? Meguru: I had no idea why. She just stopped coming... Meguru: She never answered my calls or texts either. Meguru: After a while of that, I couldn't take it anymore and went over to her place. Meguru: But when I got there... her house was completely vacant. Shuuji: Huh...? Meguru: So I asked our homeroom teacher, but he wouldn't tell me anything. All he would say was that she left our school. Meguru: And now... I still have no idea where Chi-chan is or what she's currently doing... Shuuji: So... what you're saying is that she suddenly moved away and never told you? Meguru: She didn't tell me anything. She wouldn't even answer my texts or calls. Meguru: But I just figured that it made sense. Shuuji: ...Why's that? Meguru: I said something terrible to Chi-chan right before she stopped coming to school. Meguru: \"I can't get along with anyone else, but you're the only friend I want.\" Meguru: \"It's the same for you, right? So let's be friends forever.\" Shuuji: What's so terrible about that? Meguru: But when I think back on it now, I realize how put off she looked when I said that. Meguru: It was almost like I said something revolting to her... Shuuji: ...... Meguru: That's why I figured it must have been my fault that she didn't tell me anything. Meguru: Maybe it hurt her when I told her she didn't have any other friends than me. Meguru: I would say inconsiderate stuff like that and act like a selfish kid around her all the time. Maybe that was too much for her. Meguru: That must be why she disappeared from my life completely... Shuuji: But... Meguru: Partly because I lost my best friend... Meguru: But also, with Chi-chan gone, I was back to being without a single friend I could open up to. Shuuji: Ah... Meguru: So after that, I just became an introverted bookworm. Meguru: I knew I was too annoying to be good at making friends, so I was too scared to ever try again. Meguru: I also felt like I'd never get a friendship like Chi-chan's again, anyway. Meguru: And besides, not even my best friend Chi-chan wanted to be friends with me anymore. Shuuji: ...I see. Meguru: I decided I couldn't let things continue like that. Shuuji: ...... Meguru: I wanted to get good at socializing and tried my best to achieve that. Meguru: So if I were to meet Chi-chan again... I could apologize to her and tell her that I'm different now. Shuuji: ...And that's why you changed yourself when you entered Himematsu. Meguru: Yeah, exactly. Shuuji: I see... Meguru: ...I-I'm sorry. I just ended up spewing some boring, incomprehensible nonsense! Meguru: L-Let's talk about something else! Umm, err, like about MonHun― Shuuji: No. I get exactly how you feel. Shuuji: I've gone through some stuff and struggled to talk to people too. Shuuji: I've always had hardly any friends. The most I could ever muster was some smalltalk with my classmates. I would just wear a fake smile and try not to upset anyone. Shuuji: It got to the point where, just a little while back, my own dad told me I had the eyes of a dead fish. Meguru: Ah... Shuuji: Yeah, you've thought the same, I'm sure. Meguru: N-No! I would never think anything like that! I just thought you look kinda gloomy. Like you didn't have any friends and stuff... Shuuji: Yeah, that doesn't make it much better. Meguru: I'm sorry! Shuuji: It's alright. After all, it's the truth. Shuuji: But, you see, circumstances led me to joining the OC where I got in touch with everyone else's worries. That made me take a closer look at myself, which led to a thought. Meguru: Wh-Which is...? Shuuji: That I couldn't let things continue like that. Meguru: ...... Shuuji: I mean, I couldn't even muster a decent smile. It was so stiff that even I thought I looked gross. Shuuji: That inspired me to change myself. To give myself a more natural smile... Meguru: ...I see. Meguru: So you're... the same as me... Shuuji: Do you understand how I felt? Meguru: Y-Yeah! I totally do! It's almost like you were talking about me! Shuuji: Thanks. That is why I feel like I can understand your situation so well.   Shuuji: ...Thanks for telling me. Meguru: D-Don't thank me! I should thank you... Meguru: You told me about yourself, listened to my story and understood me. I'm so happy... Shuuji: Then that makes two of us. Meguru: Seems so... Ahahaha... Shuuji: ...... Meguru: ...... Shuuji: I-I guess it's about time we go home. Meguru: R-R-Right, we've been talking all evening... Meguru: Th-This is far enough. Meguru: Yeah. It's only a few minutes from here, and the streets are well-lit. Shuuji: Okay. Then I'll head home. See you on Monday, Inaba-san. Meguru: Yeah... Meguru: ...Oh, wait a moment! One last thing. Shuuji: Huh? What's up? Meguru: Umm... I don't know how to put this, but, umm... Meguru: I-I know you think you haven't been able to smile well... Shuuji: ...Huh? Meguru: But... Meguru: Your smile has never felt unpleasant to me! Shuuji: ...... Meguru: Y-Yeah... Hehe... Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Ready to have a taste of mine this time? Shuuji: Ahaha, yeah of course you― Meguru: But... Meguru: ...Can I ask for something else instead? Shuuji: What? L-Like, you want me to drink the rest of your cafe au lait or something? Meguru: ...... Shuuji: ...Inaba-san? Meguru: Meguru. Meguru: Could you, from today on... start calling me by my given name? Shuuji: ...... Meguru: ...... Meguru: N-Never mind! I take that back! Forget I said anything! Shuuji: M-Meguru. Meguru: Ah... Shuuji: Is that what you wanted? Meguru: A-Again. One more time. Shuuji: ...Meguru. Meguru: ～～～!! Shuuji: ...Hellooo Meguru. Meguru: That's me! Shuuji: Nn... "

I brought cupcakes! Tsumugi, Touko: Oooh♪ Tsumugi: Oh, yeah. Your cookies and pudding were great! I'm sure your cupcakes are good too. Meguru: They turned out pretty well, I think. Alright, here you go, Tsumugi-senpai! Tsumugi: Wow♪ Thanks～ Meguru: Togakushi-senpai, here's yours! Touko: Ooh♪ This is such a wonderful surprise. Thank you. Nene: Can I try one as well? Meguru: Of course you can! I made a ton of 'em. There's no way I'd leave you out!  Meguru: So here, take one! Nene: Thank you very much. I'll have a taste. Shuuji: Oh... Thanks. A girl's homemade cupcake, huh... Meguru: I'm sure you'll like it. Shuuji: You've been pretty cheerful lately, I have to say. Meguru: Yeah, thanks to you. Tsumugi: Oh! It's great, Meguru-chan! Meguru: Really? I'm glad you like it! Touko: It's so moist and fluffy. You didn't just use some pre-packaged mix, right? I can tell you put some real effort into these. The nuts are a great touch. Nene: It's really good, Inaba-san. This tastes just as good as the stuff they sell at bakeries.  Meguru: Wow! Nene-senpai, that's so nice of you to say! Nene: Sh-Shouldn't you sit and eat your own share? Meguru: Oh, well, maybe you should feed me. Just kidding! Nene: ...? What's the matter, Inaba-san? Meguru: Oh, nothing! Meguru: Okay, I'll eat mine now. Nene: Alright, let's call it a day here. Tsumugi: 'Kay! Meguru: Ahaha. You're welcome. Shuuji: Welp, time to head home. Meguru: Ah, Senpai, Senpai. Meguru: Are you free after this? Shuuji: I guess, yeah. Meguru: Then, well... let's go home together! Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Umm... Is this another cupcake? Meguru: Y-You don't want it? Shuuji: Of course I do! I was just surprised. Shuuji: Umm... You went out of your way to make me an extra one? Meguru: ...Well, you're the one I made that promise with. Shuuji: Y-Yeah, I guess. Shuuji: Oh... Meguru: I-I'm the one thanking you, here. Meguru: Come on. Hurry up and eat it. Go, go. Shuuji: Yeah, thanks. I can't wait! Shuuji: No, you did good! It's just a little messy because I can't stop smiling while I eat. Meguru: ...... Shuuji: *munch* *munch* Yeah, it's great. This tastes awesome, Inaba-san. Meguru: ...E-Ehehehe. Meguru: Ah! Now you're making me smile and laugh too, geez! Shuuji: Huh? How is that my fault? Meguru: 'Cuz what kind of dope smiles while they eat? Meguru: You're welcome. Shuuji: Though, to be honest... I wish I had something to drink along with it. It tasted great, but now my mouth is dry. Meguru: Oh... Y-You're right! I'm sorry I didn't think of that! Meguru: Umm, there's a vending machine down the side street we talked on the other day, right? Let's go! Shuuji: Nah, no need to take a detour just for that. I was only half serious, anyway. Meguru: Oh, okay, right... Meguru: Yeah...? Shuuji: I'll take that detour after all. Wanna tag along? I wouldn't mind chatting more with you. Meguru: Ah... Meguru: Yeah! Of course! Meguru: There we go. Meguru: Hm? What's wrong, Senpai? Shuuji: Oh, nothing. Shuuji: For sure. Meguru: That's good. I was afraid you wouldn't want to eat any of my treats anymore. Shuuji: I'd never turn down more treats from you. It'd be awesome if I could have more sometime. Meguru: Roger that. Next time I'll make something easier to eat. Meguru: So... What did you want to talk about now?  Shuuji: Hm? Meguru: Don't \"hm\" me! Didn't you just say you wanted to chat some more? Shuuji: O-Ohh... Right... Meguru: You want to know? Shuuji: Yeah. After getting this involved, I'm kinda curious. I haven't heard any of the details yet. Meguru: Hmm, let's see... Meguru: Nene-senpai kept chatting away about nothing in particular. Shuuji: Oh yeah? Meguru: Other than that, I made dinner to show my thanks for letting me sleep over... Meguru: Oh, right! We also took a bath together! And even better, it was Nene-senpai who invited me for that! Meguru: And before you ask, we didn't wash each other or anything. But man, Nene-senpai has such a nice figure and pretty skin. I'm a girl and was still totally captivated. It's not fair how she gets to be both slender and voluptuous. Shuuji: Y-You don't say... Meguru: Hey, I know that look! You're picturing her right now, aren't you?! You perv! Shuuji: You can't blame me after you're the one who said all that stuff. Shuuji: Erm, I was picturing you this time. Meguru: WHAT?! Wh-Why me?! Meguru: Why would you imagine ME naked?!

We must've been concentrating pretty hard. Shuuji: How about we talk about the party? Would make for a nice change of pace. Touko: That's a good idea. Nene: Then I'll go and make us some more tea. Tsumugi: Thanks, Ayachi-san. Shuuji: Hasn't it gotten a little bit dark in here? Meguru: Let's switch on the lights. Nene-senpai, is it okay to switch on the lights?  Nene: Yes, of course it is. I think I left the remote for the lights somewhere near the sofa.  Meguru: Roger that. Meguru: Remote, remote... Nene: You can't find it? Meguru: Give me a few seconds. Umm... Ah, found it. But... Huh? Shuuji: What's wrong? Meguru: ...It's a little different from the one at my home. It's smaller, and only has a few buttons. Shuuji: Wh-What are you holding there, Inaba-san?!

It doesn't look like a remote for an air conditioner or TV. What is it? Nene: I-It's a remote detonator! Meguru: A remote detonator?! Nene: This room will explode if you press that button! You'd bomb us all! Meguru: Why would you have such a terrifying switch?! Shuuji: L-Look! O-Over here! Isn't this the remote for the lights?! Shuuji: I'll turn on the lights, so you can come back over here now. Meguru: Okay, thanks. Shuuji: Umm, Ayachi-san, here. Nene: ...Thank you, very much. Shuuji: Yeah, uh, don't worry about it. Shuuji: Anyway... Is this the remote for your egg― Nene: %130;Huh? What did you just say? Shuuji: You can't just keep pretending to be a dense anime protagonist whenever you're in trouble. Nene: God... I hate this. I'm going home... Shuuji: You ARE home. Nene: It's not like you think! It's, umm... for when the arousal sometimes comes on especially strongly... I-I don't use it every time! Shuuji: Uh, I never asked you about that. Calm down. Nene: I-It's all that stupid contract's fault! Shuuji: ...Yeah, okay. The contract. Nene: Yes, the contract. Shuuji: ...... Nene: ...... Nene: I can't take this anymore. This can't be happening. This can't be happening. This can't be happening... Death is the only way out now. Shuuji: Calm down. I haven't said anything. Nene: Your look... Your look says it all. It says that I'm a pervert for using an egg vibrator. Shuuji: I'm not thinking anything like that! Shuuji: Though, I WAS wondering why it was still out... Nene: I-It's not like you think! I'm not actually using it right now or anything! I'm not a pervert! Nene: I DID put it away! The egg itself, at least... But apparently I forgot the remote... Shuuji: So, there isn't anything else you forgot to put away, is there? We're all good now, right? Nene: Umm......... Nene: ........................... Nene: W-We're all good! Shuuji: It took you that long to think about it?! And why do you still sound so unsure?! Meguru: How far have you gotten so far? I don't know, since I've been studying the whole time. Nene: We have booked catering for light food, and we have ordered some inexpensive soft drinks over the internet. Nene: As for the party staff, we've discussed it with the Student Council and are currently making a shift plan. There should be no problems there. Nene: We also ordered the decorations on the internet when we ordered the drinks and got permission from the school to store them there upon delivery. Nene: Our overall plan has been to keep costs low by ordering through online stores that have good discounts. We'll only go out and buy the things we overlooked. Meguru: Ooh... Seems like most everything was taken care of while I wasn't paying attention. Touko: Just like I thought, Ayachi-san is very capable. She's so good at this that my help almost seems unnecessary. Nene: That's not true. I'm only able to be this efficient thanks to all the information you gave us. Nene: Except for the program. Meguru: Have we not made any progress there? Touko: We have. Our school's brass band will play at the party. Meguru: But that alone isn't enough? Nene: I wouldn't say that. But it's hard to tell until we actually hold the party. Touko: The party's main guests will be students, so we don't need anything super showy, but it's hard to tell how they'll feel until the party starts. Touko: At least we don't need a full stage schedule like with the cultural festival. Touko: But, just to be on the safe side, it would be better to have something that would fire everyone up with a whoomph.  Tsumugi: With a \"whoomph\"? Meguru: How about cavalry battle? Shuuji: That would certainly liven things up. If it were the sports festival. Meguru: A hotdog eating contest? Shuuji: Why do you keep bringing up typical sports festival events? Meguru: Then, what about a play? Touko: We did consider that. While it works for a cultural festival, wouldn't it be tiring to focus on the stage for too long at a party? Shuuji: Besides, we wouldn't be able to get the Drama Club to put together a show on such short notice. Nene: The third-years have already retired, so the club has their hands full practicing for next spring's cultural festival. Meguru: I see... Oh! Then how about embrace the Halloween theme and, like, do a candy exchange? Meguru: Everyone has to bring some candy, and then they exchange it with each other. Nene: Isn't exchanging sweets something you do on Christmas rather than Halloween? Shuuji: Giving out candy does fit Halloween... Though, that might be a bit daunting if participation is mandatory. Shuuji: Ideally, we want something everyone can participate in at their leisure, and still fun for those who don't participate... Hmmm... Shuuji: Oh, I know! How about a costume contest? Nene: A costume contest? Shuuji: You said that a lot of students wear Halloween costumes at the party, right? Touko: Yeah, a good number of them do every year. Tsumugi: So, you mean make it mandatory this time? Shuuji: No, that's too much to ask for. Shuuji: I'm talking about voting on who put the most effort into their costume, and who looks best in their costume. Meguru: You mean kinda like a beauty contest? Shuuji: Kinda, yeah. Shuuji: It doesn't have to be as grand, though. You'd need to submit your entry, but you wouldn't have to do anything special like presenting yourself on stage. Also, no separate brackets for girls and boys. Shuuji: And, hmm... As for the prizes, maybe something like school cafeteria meal tickets? We can fit that in our budget, right? Nene: Yes, we certainly do have the budget for that... Shuuji: If it's just casting a vote, everyone could participate no problem. Touko: Oh, yes, that's good. That would certainly liven things up. Tsumugi: If there's nothing weird like a swimsuit contest, I feel like a lot of students might participate. Shuuji: Well... I'm worried if we'll get enough participants, actually. Nene: Yeah, I know what you mean. The party could come around only for there to be no one willing to participate. Touko: You don't need to worry about that. There'll be at least five participants. Shuuji: Huh? Do you know anyone who'd participate? Touko: Yup. They're right here. Shuuji: Right here...? Wait, you mean... Shuuji: One...? Meguru: ...Two? Tsumugi: Three? Nene: Four... Touko: And five! Touko: See? We could at least stop the party from getting too awkward if we participate. Shuuji: Ahh, yeah. Touko: Not at all. You're very necessary. You need to show everyone that guys can participate too. Shuuji: Well, I guess that makes sense. Tsumugi: But that means that us five will definitely have to wear costumes, right? Meguru: More or less, yeah. Tsumugi: You... don't seem very bothered by it. Don't you think it's embarrassing? Or maybe you're an avid cosplayer? Meguru: No, it'll be my first time. I mean, it's a little embarrassing... But don't you think costumes will make the party more fun? Meguru: We'll have to help run the party the whole time anyway, so we might as well have fun with it. Tsumugi: Yeah... I guess. Meguru: Besides, it's not like you have to wear some kind of super sexy costume. Meguru: There'll be a lot of other people wearing costumes, so I think it'd be cool to give it a shot as well. Tsumugi: Well... Yeah, you might have a point. Shuuji: Do you not want to wear a costume, Shiiba-san? Tsumugi: I mean... It's not like I don't want to. It just seems like it'd be really embarrassing. Meguru: We'll be wearing costumes together, Tsumugi-senpai! You hardly ever get a chance like this! Tsumugi: ...... Tsumugi: ...A-As long as the costume isn't too revealing. Meguru: Of course. I don't want to dress in anything embarrassing, myself. Touko: Are you also alright with that, Ayachi-san? Nene: Well... If I don't have to wear anything weird that stands out too much, then I have no objections. Meguru: How are we going to get our costumes? Touko: Ah, leave that to me! I'll get costumes for all of us ready. Nene: Huh? But... Touko: Specifically, I want to ask the Fashion Design Club. So you all don't have to worry about your costumes. Tsumugi: Even if it's the Fashion Design Club, won't it be hard for them to prepare this many costumes on such short notice? Touko: It won't be a problem if I ask them now. I'm friends with the club president there, and she's is always talking about how much she likes making clothes for cute girls. Touko: I'm sure she would love to make costumes for you three. She would probably beg me for the honor and would hate me if I didn't ask her. Nene: Okay... Can you take care of that for us, then? Touko: Yup! You bet! Touko: My, this party is starting to sound so fun. Meguru: You said it! Let's make this the best party ever! Touko: Yeah! Nene: Well then, Inaba-san, we better get back to studying so you can actually attend that party. Meguru: Ugh... I'd rather not be reminded... Nene: We were quite productive today, I'd say. Touko: Yeah, we sure were. That was a great study session! Meguru: My head hurts a little from all the concentrating. Nene: Today would be all for naught if you end up forgetting everything. Make sure you review everything if you want it to stick. Meguru: Ugh... I know. Tsumugi: Ayachi-san, thanks for letting us use your apartment. Nene: Don't thank me. I really enjoyed studying together with everyone. Tsumugi: Yeah, I had a ton of fun too! Shuuji: Thanks for helping me study today. Nene: You're very welcome. Usually it's always you helping me out. Touko: Well, Inaba-san, think you can pass your tests now? Meguru: It's hard to say, but... I'll make sure not to waste Nene-senpai's lessons! Nene: I'm hoping for some good results, Inaba-san. Meguru: Y-Yeah... I'll do my best. Shuuji: Anyway, we shouldn't stand around here chatting forever, so... Tsumugi: Right. See you all on Monday, then. Meguru: Thank you for today, Nene-senpai. Touko: Thanks for having us. Shuuji: Have a nice weekend, Ayachi-san. Nene: Thank you. You too. Touko: I need to take the train, so I'm heading this way. Bye-bye. Meguru: See you. Tsumugi: Thanks for all the help today. Touko: Let's try our best to pass our tests too! Until next week. Shuuji: Yeah, see you at school. Enjoy the rest of your weekend. Shuuji: Alright, you both live in the same direction, right? I've already come this far, so I may as well see you two home. Meguru: You don't have to. My place is just around the corner, and Tsumugi-senpai is with me too. We'll be just fine. Tsumugi: Yeah. I'm happy you want to see us home, but don't you live in the other direction? You've already gone out your way for us enough. There's no need to go even more out of the way. Meguru: Okay, so we'll go the rest of the way alone. Bye! Today was a lot of fun. Tsumugi: It really was. Have a nice weekend. Bye-bye. Shuuji: You too. See you two on Monday. Shuuji: ...Welp, time for me to go home as well. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Man, I really am acting strange. I've never really cared about a school event before. Wakana: ...Oh, Hoshina? Shuuji: Kariya? What are you doing here? Wakana: I'm going home from guitar practice. Shuuji: Out practicing this close to midterms, huh? Wakana: Well, you know, I just needed a change of pace. Hahaha... *sigh* Wakana: As if! I'm not brave enough for that. I'm renting a rehearsal studio. Shuuji: Can you do that by yourself? I always figured that was something only bands could do. Wakana: Rehearsal studios come in all shapes and forms. A lot of places rent out small studios for solo practice. That's the kind I'm renting. Wakana: I've got some cash to play around with thanks to my job at the cafe, so sometimes I rent out a rehearsal studio where I can go all out with an amp. Shuuji: You don't do street performance? Wakana: Oh, please. I'm really not brave enough for that. And it seems like it'd be a real pain in the butt. Shuuji: Then how about forming a band? Wakana: I'm just a hobbyist. I mean, sure, I'm getting some decent practice in now that I bought my own guitar, but still. Shuuji: You've been at this for a while, though. It's been a few years, right? Wakana: Well, yeah. It has. Shuuji: Hmm... Shuuji: How about testing the waters a little? Wakana: Huh? What are you talking about? Shuuji: Want to try showing off your guitar skills in front of some fellow students? Wakana: Some fellow students...? What do you mean by that? What're you talking about? "

Shuuji: How about we talk about the party? Would make for a nice change of pace. Touko: That's a good idea. Nene: Then I'll go and make us some more tea. Tsumugi: Thanks, Ayachi-san. Shuuji: Hasn't it gotten a little bit dark in here? Meguru: Let's switch on the lights. Nene-senpai, is it okay to switch on the lights?  Nene: Yes, of course it is. I think I left the remote for the lights somewhere near the sofa.  Meguru: Roger that. Meguru: Remote, remote... Nene: You can't find it? Meguru: Give me a few seconds. Umm... Ah, found it. But... Huh? Shuuji: What's wrong? Meguru: ...It's a little different from the one at my home. It's smaller, and only has a few buttons. Shuuji: Wh-What are you holding there, Inaba-san?! Meguru: Well, the remote for the lights? Meguru: Alright, I'll turn on the lights now. Nene: Wait! Inaba-san! Please wait a moment! Meguru: Yeah? Why? Nene: You. Must. Not. Use. That. Switch! Meguru: Why are you talking like a robot? Nene: Who cares! That's not the right switch! It's for something else! You must not press it! Meguru: Oh, really? Then what's this remote for? It doesn't look like a remote for an air conditioner or TV. What is it? Nene: I-It's a remote detonator! Meguru: A remote detonator?! Nene: This room will explode if you press that button! You'd bomb us all! Meguru: Why would you have such a terrifying switch?! Shuuji: L-Look! O-Over here! Isn't this the remote for the lights?! Shuuji: I'll turn on the lights, so you can come back over here now. Meguru: Okay, thanks. Shuuji: Umm, Ayachi-san, here. Nene: ...Thank you, very much. Shuuji: Yeah, uh, don't worry about it. Shuuji: Anyway... Is this the remote for your egg― Nene: %130;Huh? What did you just say? Shuuji: You can't just keep pretending to be a dense anime protagonist whenever you're in trouble. Nene: God... I hate this. I'm going home... Shuuji: You ARE home. Nene: It's not like you think! It's, umm... for when the arousal sometimes comes on especially strongly... I-I don't use it every time! Shuuji: Uh, I never asked you about that. Calm down. Nene: I-It's all that stupid contract's fault! Shuuji: ...Yeah, okay. The contract. Nene: Yes, the contract. Shuuji: ...... Nene: ...... Nene: I can't take this anymore. This can't be happening. This can't be happening. This can't be happening... Death is the only way out now. Shuuji: Calm down. I haven't said anything. Nene: Your look... Your look says it all. It says that I'm a pervert for using an egg vibrator. Shuuji: I'm not thinking anything like that! Shuuji: Though, I WAS wondering why it was still out... Nene: I-It's not like you think! I'm not actually using it right now or anything! I'm not a pervert! Nene: I DID put it away! The egg itself, at least... But apparently I forgot the remote... Shuuji: So, there isn't anything else you forgot to put away, is there? We're all good now, right? Nene: Umm......... Nene: ........................... Nene: W-We're all good! Shuuji: It took you that long to think about it?! And why do you still sound so unsure?! Meguru: How far have you gotten so far? I don't know, since I've been studying the whole time. Nene: We have booked catering for light food, and we have ordered some inexpensive soft drinks over the internet. Nene: As for the party staff, we've discussed it with the Student Council and are currently making a shift plan. There should be no problems there. Nene: We also ordered the decorations on the internet when we ordered the drinks and got permission from the school to store them there upon delivery.

Nene: Yeah, we do. A lot of people don't have any serious issues; they just want a push on the back. Tsumugi: Oh, yeah. You're right. I bet that a lot of the time, they've already made up their mind and just want some encouragement. Shuuji: This is probably a good thing, considering the time of the year.

I don't want to think about it. Tsumugi: That reaction tells me everything. You really need to study more. Meguru: Ugh... Shuuji: All club activities will be put on a mandatory break starting next week as midterms near. You should have plenty of time to study.

Student: I'll try to follow your advice. Nene: Okay. Please stop by if you ever need help again. Nene: Thank you. Meguru: You know, way more people are stopping by for fortune telling than consultations lately. Nene: Yeah, that's true. Tsumugi: Do you get these stretches of no consultations often? Nene: Yeah, we do. A lot of people don't have any serious issues; they just want a push on the back. Tsumugi: Oh, yeah. You're right. I bet that a lot of the time, they've already made up their mind and just want some encouragement. Shuuji: This is probably a good thing, considering the time of the year. Nene: Yeah, midterms are coming up soon. A lot of students probably want to focus on studying, even if they have other things to worry about. Shuuji: I gotta study up myself. Meguru: Wow, Senpai, you take your studying pretty seriously, huh? Shuuji: Well, I didn't have anything else to do other than studying before joining the OC. Tsumugi: You must have pretty good grades then. Shuuji: Nothing worth bragging about. I'm just above average, I'd say. Meguru: ...Tch. I always figured you were a slacker who intentionally bombed your tests to get the easier retakes. Shuuji: Wow. How rude. Tsumugi: Are your grades good, Meguru-chan? Meguru: ...Please don't ask. I don't want to think about it. Tsumugi: That reaction tells me everything. You really need to study more. Meguru: Ugh... Shuuji: All club activities will be put on a mandatory break starting next week as midterms near. You should have plenty of time to study.  Meguru: I wouldn't be having this problem in the first place if all I needed was time to study. Shuuji: I know where you're coming from, but you're only hurting yourself by not studying. Meguru: Stop it! You're making way too much sense! I don't wanna hear it! Tsumugi: Ahaha, you can't keep making excuses for yourself. Shuuji: Huh, Koshiji-san? Koshiji: Hi there. Long time no see. Shuuji: Oh, yeah, it's been a while. Thanks for back then. And congrats on becoming president. Koshiji: Ahh... Yeah. I was hoping to forget that, so thanks a lot for bringing it up again. But really, thank you for your help back then. Shuuji: Oh, well, umm... I'm sorry.

Let's call it a day so you can take it easy. Nene: ...Very well. Thank you for looking out for me. Touko: Helping people is important, but you're not going to be able to help anyone if you get sick. Touko: I'll take over tidying and locking up, so you can go straight home. Nene: ...Are you sure? Touko: Yup, just leave it to me! Nene: Well then, I'll be excusing myself. Thank you, everyone. Touko: Bye-bye～ Make sure you get some rest! Tsumugi: Wait up! I'll go home with you, just in case. Meguru: Oh, I'll come too. What about you, Senpai?

Touko: Oh my, what do you mean? I only made a simple observation. Shuuji: You know what you said, and you clearly did it on purpose. Touko: Mufufu. You're blushing, you know? Shuuji: I'm not used to stuff like this... Go easy on me, please. Touko: Okay, my bad. Well, it's getting late, so how about we start locking up? Shuuji: Yeah, let's. Shuuji: But, before that... Could I have a moment? Touko: Of course. There's no rush. Oh, have you decided to talk to me at last? Shuuji: It's more of a request, I guess? Touko: You need something from me? Touko: Oh, is this about your reward? Decided what you wanted, have you? Go on then, let's hear it. Touko: Please, be honest with me. How can I be of service? Shuuji: I'd just like to talk for a minute if you don't mind. Touko: You want to talk? But isn't that what we're doing right now? Or do you mean you want to talk about sex? Like pillow talk? Oh my, you naughty boy. Shuuji: Could you please cut it out with the dirty jokes? Shuuji: I don't want any kind of special conversation. Certainly not one about sex. I just want us to talk normally so I can learn more about you. Shuuji: I mean, yes, there is a reason I want to talk to you, but we don't have to talk about anything specific... A normal conversation will do just fine, really. Touko: You're really serious about this. My bad. I just went and poked fun at you like normal. Shuuji: No, it's fine. I mean, I know this is a bit out of the blue. Touko: What's this about, though? Why do you want to know more about me? Shuuji: Well, you see, errm... There's no big reason behind it. Shuuji: It's just, we're in the same club, but I barely know anything about you. When I realized that, it started to bother me and made me want to do something about it. Touko: Oh, I see. Shuuji: So I just thought we could hang out together a little, or something. Shuuji: So... is that a no, then? Touko: Chatting itself isn't a problem. I don't mind doing that. Shuuji: Oh, well, that's good... Touko: Well, chatting a little isn't much of a reward, is it? It's just a normal, everyday thing. Touko: So it doesn't feel right. Hmm... Oh, I know. Let's go somewhere on our next day off, just the two of us, and talk there. Shuuji: Huh? Just the two of us? Touko: Yeah, that's right. That'll make it nice and easy for us to talk, won't it? Shuuji: D-Do you mean like... Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Yeah, sounds great. Touko: It's settled, then! Your reward for doing a good job with the Halloween party is a date with me. I sound a bit arrogant, putting it that way. Ahaha. Shuuji: N-No, I don't think you did at all. Thank you very much, Senpai. Touko: No problem. Well then, I'm looking forward to our date.

I mean, the drum thing worked out, didn't it? Shuuji: That's true. Shuuji: You're being awfully nice today. Hideaki: That's 'cause it looks like something's really bothering you. And now I wanna know what it is. Shuuji: You're really enjoying this, huh? Hideaki: Kinda? But I'm pretty worried too. I'm not gonna laugh at you, I swear. I'll just give you my opinion. Shuuji: The whole reason I'm hesitant is that I know you'll laugh at me. Hideaki: A date, huh? I see, hmm... Hideaki: ...... Hideaki: Pfft, ahahahaha! Even middle schoolers don't worry about that nowadays! Ahahahaha! Shuuji: I thought you weren't gonna laugh! Hideaki: Sorry, my bad. Couldn't help it. Just didn't expect you to be worrying about a date. Shuuji: I think a lot of people worry about dates, actually. Hideaki: I went out and bought new clothes and everything for it. But I was wearing stuff I wasn't used to, so it went horribly. Shuuji: So, do you think I should dress up properly for a date? Hideaki: I dunno. Like, obviously you have to pay attention to your looks, but... I don't think you need to dress fancy or anything. Hideaki: Especially in your case, Shuuji. It's not like you're going on an actual date, right? So the rules for a normal date don't apply. Shuuji: Yeah... You're right. "

Even middle schoolers don't worry about that nowadays! Ahahahaha! Shuuji: I thought you weren't gonna laugh! Hideaki: Sorry, my bad. Couldn't help it. Just didn't expect you to be worrying about a date. Shuuji: I think a lot of people worry about dates, actually. Hideaki: I went out and bought new clothes and everything for it. But I was wearing stuff I wasn't used to, so it went horribly. Shuuji: So, do you think I should dress up properly for a date? Hideaki: I dunno. Like, obviously you have to pay attention to your looks, but... I don't think you need to dress fancy or anything. Hideaki: Especially in your case, Shuuji. It's not like you're going on an actual date, right? So the rules for a normal date don't apply. Shuuji: Yeah... You're right. "

Schoolgirl D: Ayachi-san! Let's start a band together! With your heavenly voice, we'll make it big for sure! Nene: Sorry, but I'm not interested. I was just a stand-in for that one occasion. Schoolgirl D: But didn't the crowd's reaction feel great? Don't you wanna get more of that, on an even bigger stage? I know you can do it, Ayachi-san! Nene: Thank you for the compliment, but I really can't. I'm not good at being in front of crowds. Schoolgirl D: *sigh* Okay, I guess there's no changing your mind. Aww man, we could've hit it big... Schoolgirl D: Oh! But if you ever change your mind and wanna step onto the stage again, talk to me first! You gotta! Nene: *sigh* Very well. Touko: You had it tough today. Here's some tea. Drink it and let it calm your soul. Watch out, though; it's hot. Nene: Thank you, Togakushi-senpai. Nene: *blow* *sip* Ahh, wonderful... Tsumugi: And there were even more people who asked her in our classroom. Meguru: Really? Whoa, that's crazy... Nene: I'm glad that they liked my singing... I just wish they would leave me be. Touko: Now, now, this just shows how wonderfully your band played, doesn't it? Nene: Yes, and that's an honor, and I'm truly grateful, but... it's rather draining... Shuuji: In fact, I'm sure it'll be a lot calmer tomorrow, even. The party is still fresh in everyone's minds. Nene: I hope you're right... Meguru: Should we wrap things up here, then? Nene-senpai's looking pretty rough. Tsumugi: They'll be closing the club building soon, so I doubt anyone else is gonna come to us with their problems. Shuuji: There you have it, Ayachi-san. Let's call it a day so you can take it easy. Nene: ...Very well. Thank you for looking out for me. Touko: Helping people is important, but you're not going to be able to help anyone if you get sick. Touko: I'll take over tidying and locking up, so you can go straight home. Nene: ...Are you sure? Touko: Yup, just leave it to me! Nene: Well then, I'll be excusing myself. Thank you, everyone. Touko: Bye-bye～ Make sure you get some rest! Tsumugi: Wait up! I'll go home with you, just in case. Meguru: Oh, I'll come too. What about you, Senpai? Shuuji: I feel bad making Togakushi-senpai tidy up by herself, so I'll stay and help her out. Tsumugi: Bye, then. Shuuji: Yeah, see you later. Touko: See you tomorrow～ Shuuji: ...... Touko: Oh my, what do you mean? I only made a simple observation. Shuuji: You know what you said, and you clearly did it on purpose. Touko: Mufufu. You're blushing, you know? Shuuji: I'm not used to stuff like this... Go easy on me, please. Touko: Okay, my bad. Well, it's getting late, so how about we start locking up? Shuuji: Yeah, let's. Shuuji: But, before that... Could I have a moment? Touko: Of course. There's no rush. Oh, have you decided to talk to me at last? Shuuji: It's more of a request, I guess? Touko: You need something from me? Touko: Oh, is this about your reward? Decided what you wanted, have you? Go on then, let's hear it. Touko: Please, be honest with me. How can I be of service? Shuuji: I'd just like to talk for a minute if you don't mind. Touko: You want to talk? But isn't that what we're doing right now? Or do you mean you want to talk about sex? Like pillow talk? Oh my, you naughty boy. Shuuji: Could you please cut it out with the dirty jokes? Shuuji: I don't want any kind of special conversation. Certainly not one about sex. I just want us to talk normally so I can learn more about you. Shuuji: I mean, yes, there is a reason I want to talk to you, but we don't have to talk about anything specific... A normal conversation will do just fine, really. Touko: You're really serious about this. My bad. I just went and poked fun at you like normal. Shuuji: No, it's fine. I mean, I know this is a bit out of the blue. Touko: What's this about, though? Why do you want to know more about me? Shuuji: Well, you see, errm... There's no big reason behind it. Shuuji: It's just, we're in the same club, but I barely know anything about you. When I realized that, it started to bother me and made me want to do something about it. Touko: Oh, I see. Shuuji: So I just thought we could hang out together a little, or something. Shuuji: So... is that a no, then? Touko: Chatting itself isn't a problem. I don't mind doing that. Shuuji: Oh, well, that's good... Touko: Well, chatting a little isn't much of a reward, is it? It's just a normal, everyday thing. Touko: So it doesn't feel right. Hmm... Oh, I know. Let's go somewhere on our next day off, just the two of us, and talk there. Shuuji: Huh? Just the two of us? Touko: Yeah, that's right. That'll make it nice and easy for us to talk, won't it? Shuuji: D-Do you mean like... Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Yeah, sounds great. Touko: It's settled, then! Your reward for doing a good job with the Halloween party is a date with me. I sound a bit arrogant, putting it that way. Ahaha. Shuuji: N-No, I don't think you did at all. Thank you very much, Senpai. Touko: No problem. Well then, I'm looking forward to our date. Shuuji: I-I'm looking forward to it too. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: A date with Togakushi-senpai... Shuuji: A date... A date, huh? Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Do I even have any good date clothes?! Hideaki: Yo! Shuuji: Hey. Hideaki: What're you doing here so early? Shuuji: Just thinking about things. Hideaki: If something's bothering you, why not go talk to your friends at the OC? Shuuji: If it was a normal problem, I would. Shuuji: But this is a matter of pride. I can't talk to girls about this. Hideaki: Oho. This sounds interesting―no, I dare say fascinating. Hideaki: Well, we're both men here. You can talk to me about it! Shuuji: Huh? With you? Kaidou...? Hideaki: What's with that reaction? Don't talk smack until you try! I mean, the drum thing worked out, didn't it? Shuuji: That's true. Shuuji: You're being awfully nice today. Hideaki: That's 'cause it looks like something's really bothering you. And now I wanna know what it is. Shuuji: You're really enjoying this, huh? Hideaki: Kinda? But I'm pretty worried too. I'm not gonna laugh at you, I swear. I'll just give you my opinion. Shuuji: The whole reason I'm hesitant is that I know you'll laugh at me. Hideaki: A date, huh? I see, hmm... Hideaki: ...... Hideaki: Pfft, ahahahaha!

            "Meguru: Ugh, I didn't get a single chance to play together with Nene-senpai today... It was just you all day long... Shuuji: No use crying about that. Ayachi-san was busy all day dealing with everyone stopping by. Meguru: Nene-senpai, do you think we could just get one quest in together? Nene: I'm sorry, but I really don't feel like playing games after all that... Nene: Besides... Nene: I-It's just you. Right, Hoshina-kun? Shuuji: Yeah, don't be silly. C'mon, you'll get left behind if you don't hurry up. Meguru: ...Hey, don't just gloss over my question like that. Shuuji: We're not glossing over anything. Anyway, where's my bag? Meguru: ...... Meguru: (Is there something going on between them? This is kinda frustrating...) Touko: Okay, I have plans to see a friend now. See you all tomorrow. Tsumugi: Yeah, bye. Tsumugi: How about we all go somewhere too? Or maybe it would be better to go straight home today, huh? Nene: Yes... I would appreciate that. Tsumugi: That's fine! Get plenty of rest. Meguru: ...... Shuuji: Hm? Inaba-san, what's wrong? You don't wanna go home? Meguru: ...Senpai. Meguru: Come with me for a bit! Shuuji: Wha?! Nene: Ah, okay... Meguru: I need to talk to you! Meguru: Oh, our hands... Shuuji: You're just now realizing that? Meguru: Y-Yeah. I just kinda grabbed your hand without thinking. Sorry! Shuuji: It's not like I mind... Shuuji: Umm... So what do you want to talk about? Meguru: Oh, r-right! About that, umm... Shuuji: What? Meguru: I mean y-you're unfair! Meguru: I wanna get along with Nene-senpai too! Shuuji: ...What? Meguru: It feels like you been talking to each other behind everyone's backs! Meguru: You've been talking with THE Nene-senpai! She's cute, pretty, has a great figure, is classy but nice... but she still keeps everyone at a distance. Everyone but you, it seems! Meguru: That's so not fair! Meguru: N-No, I wouldn't go that far. I'd feel bad asking about that... Shuuji: Yeah? Meguru: Senpai, how have you gotten so close with Nene-senpai? Shuuji: Right, umm... Shuuji: Hmm... If you wanna be better friends with her, shouldn't you have gone home with her instead of dragging me off somewhere? Meguru: W-Well yeah, I guess, but... Shuuji: Though, if it were that easy, we wouldn't be here right now. Meguru: Y-Yeah! Right! Shuuji: But you know, the way I see it is that you're the one who's closer to Ayachi-san. Shuuji: It's not like I can hug Ayachi-san like you do. Meguru: Well, no duh! Guys can't just hug girls out of nowhere! That'd be so wrong! Shuuji: Can't exactly say no to that. Ayachi-san is pretty hot... Meguru: Ugh... You're such a creeper sometimes. Seriously, how can you say that? Shuuji: You're the one who asked me that! Any guy would feel the same way. It's not like we act on every urge we get! Meguru: Looking at it the other way around, all I can do is hug her and nothing else. Shuuji: What do you mean by that? Meguru: W-Well, you know... We never chat alone in the clubroom during lunch break, for example. Shuuji: So that really has been weighing on your mind... We didn't talk about anything special there, okay? Meguru: Th-That doesn't make it any less unfair. I'm still just as jealous knowing that! Meguru: Remember what I said yesterday? I just want all of my friendships to be deep. That's why! Shuuji: Hmm... Meguru: But like I just mentioned, Nene-senpai always seems kinda distant, you know? So it's hard to just up and ask her. Meguru: What if she went all, \"You want me to eat lunch with you? Why would I do that?\" I'd die from shock. Shuuji: ...Yeah, that's tough. Shuuji: Okay. I'll do what I can. Meguru: ...!! Shuuji: Err, I think it's a bit early to be thanking me. Meguru: Whatcha mean? Shuuji: While I'd love to help you, I'm not actually sure how I got so close to Ayachi-san. Shuuji: So I don't have a clue where to start. Meguru: What?! Meguru: Th-That's not true! You're like super close! You've even been communicating with eye contact alone! Meguru: That's the whole reason I said this is unfair! Shuuji: Well, I'm glad you think so, but I dunno what to do... Shuuji: Like you said earlier, there's an inherent difference in how we can interact with her since I'm a guy and you're a girl. I doubt my approach would work for you. Meguru: You got close with her in a way only a guy can...? Meguru: W-Wait! Is that why you understand each other so well?! I mean, like, your relationship has gotten ph-ph-physical?! Shuuji: Whoa, whoa! Hold on! You're way off-base! Why are you taking things in that direction?! Meguru: Don't put this on me! You're the one who made it sound like that! Shuuji: I didn't! That was all you! Anyway, just calm down. Let's get some drinks at the vending machine over there. Shuuji: That's what I want to say... *sip* Anyway, that was just a misunderstanding on your part.  Meguru: Yeah, I know. There's no way that'd be true now that I think about it. Shuuji: Would've been nice if you thought that through sooner... Would have saved me some money on the drinks. Meguru: Ah, speaking of, is the milk tea you got any good? I had a hard time deciding between that and this coffee. Shuuji: I'd say it's better than the kind they have at school. Meguru: Hmm... Maybe I should've went with the milk tea instead. Shuuji: Want a taste? Meguru: Of course not! That would be an... i-i-indirect kiss! Shuuji: Oh... Y-Yeah, I guess so. Meguru: Geez, why are you always like this? There's no way a dolt like you could get close with Nene-senpai! Shuuji: Isn't that different from what you said earlier? Meguru: ...So please tell me how you got so close to her while being such a dolt. Shuuji: Err, like I said, I have no idea. Meguru: You are no help at all... Shuuji: Oh, give me a break. Let me think... Meguru: I won't drink that even if you wipe the rim clean. Shuuji: Forget about that already. What I'm saying is... Shuuji: Why not just go and visit Ayachi-san right now? Meguru: ...... Shuuji: And then when you're there, suggest staying the night. Meguru: ...Y-You mean, just me? Shuuji: Of course. You want to get closer to her, right? Meguru: N-No way! Shuuji: You mean you don't want to get closer to her?! Meguru: No, I do! But you want me to stay the night with her?! Meguru: Visiting her by myself would be hard enough for me... Shuuji: And yet you have no qualms hanging out at my place... Meguru: Th-That's because it's you. Meguru: R-Right. Meguru: But, umm, the idea itself is good. Sleeping over at Nene-senpai's place is like a dream for me. Shuuji: Okay, then with that goal in mind, how about you work towards getting closer to her starting tomorrow? Meguru: Ugh... Can I really do this? Shuuji: Well, how about you come and stay over at my place as practice? Meguru: AS IF!! Shuuji: Well, with that settled, let's pick this back up tomorrow. Meguru: O-Okay. See you tomorrow. Meguru: Umm... Thank you, Senpai. Shuuji: You can show your thanks by staying the night at my place. Meguru: What?! Are you serious?! Are you in super-perv Senpai mode right now?! Are you after me or something?! Shuuji: Nah, just kidding. Meguru: You've got a real messed up sense of humor... Taichi: Okay. Take care. Shuuji: ...Good morning. Meguru: Yeah! I figured you'd eventually pass by here. Shuuji: ...Why, though? Meguru: Hey! What kind of reaction is that? Meguru: Didn't you tell me you'd help me yesterday? Shuuji: Oh yeah, I guess that makes sense... Shuuji: Sorry. I was just a little taken aback. Meguru: ...Senpai? Shuuji: Oh, it's nothing. Let's walk while we talk. Meguru: Yeah! Roger that. Shuuji: We'll end up at school in no time if we follow my regular route though. Shuuji: So at the risk of sounding boring, let's take the same detour as yesterday. Shuuji: Should we not have taken a detour? Meguru: No, that was actually a good idea. Meguru: ...It just feels strange heading to school with you. Shuuji: Even though you were waiting to ambush me... Meguru: I-I know. And did you have to put it like that? You make me sound like a bad guy! Shuuji: Anyway, if you have no problem with the detour, then let's get down to business. Shuuji: We need to talk about how you should get closer to Ayachi-san. Meguru: Y-Yeah. Shuuji: So, to make sure, is the goal still being able to sleep over at her place? Meguru: Yeah, we can go with that. Meguru: I kinda got really flustered yesterday, but after thinking about it calmly, it doesn't seem too hard to do. Shuuji: If it's that easy, then can't you do this without my help? Meguru: Th-That's not how I meant it! You can't back out now! You already promised me you'd help! Meguru: Good! Meguru: You know, for how cold you seem, you're surprisingly nice. Shuuji: How am I supposed to take that? Meguru: As a compliment. Shuuji: O-Okay, thanks... Anyhow... Shuuji: The way I see it, getting used to interacting with her is the only way. Meguru: Right. I agree with that. Shuuji: And so, your first step should be― Meguru: Ne... N-N-Nene-senpai! Meguru: Good mornifsh! Nene: It's unusual to see you here in the morning. Meguru: Y-Yesh. Tru dat! Nene: ......?? Meguru: Not at all! Just saying good morninf! Meguru: Hoshina-senpai invited me, so I figured I would swing by... Nene: Okay...? Meguru: Helloha! Nene: ...Yes. Helloha to you as well. Meguru: ...... Nene: ...... "

I figured you'd eventually pass by here. Shuuji: ...Why, though? Meguru: Hey! What kind of reaction is that? Meguru: Didn't you tell me you'd help me yesterday? Shuuji: Oh yeah, I guess that makes sense... Shuuji: Sorry. I was just a little taken aback. Meguru: ...Senpai? Shuuji: Oh, it's nothing. Let's walk while we talk. Meguru: Yeah! Roger that. Shuuji: We'll end up at school in no time if we follow my regular route though. Shuuji: So at the risk of sounding boring, let's take the same detour as yesterday. Shuuji: Should we not have taken a detour? Meguru: No, that was actually a good idea. Meguru: ...It just feels strange heading to school with you. Shuuji: Even though you were waiting to ambush me... Meguru: I-I know. And did you have to put it like that? You make me sound like a bad guy! Shuuji: Anyway, if you have no problem with the detour, then let's get down to business. Shuuji: We need to talk about how you should get closer to Ayachi-san. Meguru: Y-Yeah. Shuuji: So, to make sure, is the goal still being able to sleep over at her place? Meguru: Yeah, we can go with that. Meguru: I kinda got really flustered yesterday, but after thinking about it calmly, it doesn't seem too hard to do. Shuuji: If it's that easy, then can't you do this without my help? Meguru: Th-That's not how I meant it! You can't back out now! You already promised me you'd help! Meguru: Good! Meguru: You know, for how cold you seem, you're surprisingly nice. Shuuji: How am I supposed to take that? Meguru: As a compliment. Shuuji: O-Okay, thanks... Anyhow... Shuuji: The way I see it, getting used to interacting with her is the only way. Meguru: Right. I agree with that. Shuuji: And so, your first step should be― Meguru: Ne... N-N-Nene-senpai! Meguru: Good mornifsh! Nene: It's unusual to see you here in the morning. Meguru: Y-Yesh. Tru dat! Nene: ......?? Meguru: Not at all! Just saying good morninf! Meguru: Hoshina-senpai invited me, so I figured I would swing by... Nene: Okay...? Meguru: Helloha! Nene: ...Yes. Helloha to you as well. Meguru: ......

Shuuji: Ah, sorry.  Nene: I'm sorry... I only participated as a pinch hitter. Schoolgirl D: But you can sing SO good, girl! With you, we could seriously become an international sensation!! Nene: I appreciate your kind words, I do... but I'm really sorry. I have no intention of singing any further. Schoolgirl D: Man, that's a bummer... I was ready to be a star.  Schoolgirl D: But if you ever change your mind, I'm always up for it! I'll wait for you, no matter how long it takes! Nene: U-Uhm, yes... Thank you.  Touko: Here, have some tea. I imagine you must be pretty exhausted.  Nene: Thank you, Togakushi-senpai. Touko: The only thing at home I can do is study, and doing that all day just turns my brain to mush. I'm sure you know that feeling.  Touko: So, if you guys don't mind, would it be alright if I stayed and helped the OC out?  Tsumugi: Only if you count the clubroom. If you count all the people that asked her in the classroom during school, it's way more than three.  Nene: It has been quite the day... Shuuji: ...Definitely. I can tell that just by looking at you. Touko: Well, it'll all die down soon. We just have to wait for word to spread that Ayachi-san won't keep singing.  Meguru: But still, she might get random requests to come fill for people if they lose a vocalist or something. Can't count out that possibility.  Nene: ...I really wouldn't like that. I never even expected to receive this much attention in the first place... It almost makes me wish I hadn't done this.  Touko: And I gotta imagine you'll get another rush of invitations once the cultural festival comes around next year.  Nene: Don't say that, Togakushi-senpai. Now I have to worry about that actually happening.  Touko: Oh, I'm sorry. But still, being prepared for it ahead of time isn't such a bad idea.  Nene: D-Don't worry, I have an excuse. I'll just tell them that the Occult Club is going to be doing a performance.  Shuuji: Let's hope that's enough to dissuade them.  Tsumugi: No need to worry about it now, you have time. A lot of things can change in a year, so you might as well just worry about it when the time comes.  Shuuji: True. We can't really make predictions about events that far off in the future.  Nene: Still... Just thinking about the possibility is enough to make me depressed... *sigh* Touko: How long do you guys usually stay?  Nene: It can vary depending on things, but generally, I would say we leave around six.  Shuuji: Do you wanna just call it a day now? We can do that. I know several of the sports teams end around this time too.  Touko: Good idea. I imagine Ayachi-san wants to go on home and lay down.  Meguru: We don't have to stay if you don't want to, Nene-senpai. Tsumugi: And don't forget, this is a weekday. Don't you want to be well-rested for school tomorrow? Nene: Okay... If you all have no reservations, then I suppose we can end things here for today.  Meguru: Alright, then see you guys tomorrow!  Nene: See you tomorrow. Shuuji: Alright... I got the milk, and I got the kinpira burdock. Clerk: Alright, here you are! That'll be 605 Yen. Shuuji: Here.  Clerk: 605 exactly. Thank you, thank you. Please come see us again. Shuuji: Phew, NOW I'm done. Time to go on home and get some din?Hm? Nene: ...... Nene: Huh? Ah, hello, Hoshina-kun! What are you doing here? Shuuji: Nothing much. Just doing some shopping before dinner. What're you up to?  Shuuji: I noticed you pacing around for some time.  Nene: Y-You just stood there and watched? Why didn't you come up and say something sooner... Shuuji: Sorry, I was just a little confused, so I wound up staring. Are you out grocery shopping too? Nene: No, not quite. Today was pretty exhausting for me, so I was thinking of maybe going somewhere... Shuuji: Ah, yeah, I feel that. Sometimes you just don't wanna bother with whipping up something yourself.  Shuuji: ...Ramen? Nene: I told you not to look... Shuuji: S-Sorry. But really, I don't see anything to be embarrassed about.  Nene: You really don't think it's... strange or anything? You can't tell me a girl eating at a ramen restaurant all by herself doesn't weird you out.  Shuuji: Oh no, not at all. I don't see anything wrong with it. Nene: O-Oh, well thank you. Nene: It's not something I love, per se... but I've been curious to explore it.  Nene: Do you remember that day when you and I went with Inaba-san to the conveyor-belt sushi restaurant? Shuuji: Yeah, I do.  Nene: Well, it's much the same scenario... I've never actually been to a ramen restaurant before.  Shuuji: Is that so? Shuuji: You're getting cold feet?  Nene: That's right... I looked in and only saw men dining there, so I got scared.  Nene: But the thing is, I'm not sure I'll ever work up the courage to do this again if I walk away... Shuuji: Is trying this ramen that important to you?  Nene: ...Yes. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Umm... would you like me to come with you? Maybe that would help. Nene: Ah, er, wait... I thought you were going to be eating dinner at home.  Shuuji: Nah, it's all good. None of it'll get cold. Shuuji: And all this talk of ramen's gotten me a little curious... You wouldn't mind if I joined you, would you?  Shuuji: Absolutely. Ready to go on in? Nene: Yes! Shuuji: Coming.  Nene: Ramen! Oh, Ramen! Nene: It'll be my first time having real ramen instead of the cheap, instant kind. I can't wait to see how it tastes. Nene: Is that some sort of problem, perhaps?  Shuuji: Well, before we go in, let me check with you: are you aware of what kind of place this is?  Nene: Come again? I thought it was a ramen place. Is it not? Really? But I'm sure I― Shuuji: Weeell, you could SAY it's a ramen place, but that's not quite the full picture... Let's just say it's a bit of special place. Nene: Oh, you don't have to worry about that. I've done my research prior to coming here.  Shuuji: Really?  Nene: Yes. I have it all down pat. Shuuji: Yeah, a few times with Kaidou.  Shuuji: Ah, yes. Just us two.  Clerk: We got two free seats together, so come on and follow me.  Shuuji: Are you ready, Ayachi-san? Nene: Yes! Clerk: How's it goin', y'all! Shuuji: What are you getting? Nene: The extra large char siu. Shuuji: The extra large?  Nene: Am I not allowed to?  Shuuji: Well, you are, but it's gonna be a lot of food. You sure you can handle it?  Nene: Absolutely. It might seem surprising, but I'm actually a large eater.  Shuuji: Oh, really?  Shuuji: ...Are you sure about that? Nene: Huh? Clerk: Er, yeah, absolutely, miss... W-We'll have that out to ya.  Shuuji: A-Ayachi-san, what are you DOING?! Nene: What? Is something the matter?  Shuuji: A-Are you sure you want that? Like, are you REALLY sure you want that?  Nene: Well... is that not the special code that you chant when ordering it? I read on the internet that first-timers should simply stick to ordering it that way. Shuuji: Man oh man... You actually believed that... Nene: Now it's only a matter of time before it comes out and I get to eat it! Oh, I wonder what it'll taste like... I'm so excited♪ Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Yeah, we've already ordered and everything.  Nene: I feel a little bad. My apologies. But still, I'm glad our path's crossed.  Shuuji: Y-You are...? Nene: Absolutely. I've been eager to eat at this place for so, so long. Nene: Plus enjoying meals with others is something I seldom get the chance to do. It's always nice to have company.  Shuuji: O-Ohh... yeah. Shuuji: Yeah, I'm all good.  Shuuji: That exciting for you?  Nene: Oh, yes! I've had my eyes on this restaurant for so, sooo long. But I could never bring myself to come, you see. Nene: Just to put my frustration into perspective for you, if I had waited a tad bit longer, it might've been possible to retrieve fragments from me. Shuuji: Eh, I don't know, that sounds like a bit of an exaggeration.  Nene: I guarantee you it's not. I'm genuinely happy.   Nene: But, just so you know... If you don't want to stay here with me, you don't have to. You're free to leave anytime.  Shuuji: I don't mind. And if anything, I enjoy hanging out with you.  Nene: Huh...?! Umm, what did you― Shuuji: A-Ah, uhm! I just meant that, like, when I'm with you I don't have to worry about my secret, so it makes me feel relaxed, I guess? Or comfortable? Something like that.  Nene: Ah, yes, of course. Don't worry, I fully understand what you're trying to say.  Nene: And also, I enjoy hanging out with you too, Hoshina-kun.  Shuuji: ―――! Nene: ...... Nene: A-Also, I think I ought to thank you. You've really helped me out in a variety of ways.  Shuuji: Oh, no, I'm not looking for thanks. Really, I should be the one apologizing, considering you still haven't gotten back all your fragments.  Nene: No, that's perfectly alright. They are coming back, slowly but surely.  Nene: Ah! It's finally here♪ I finally get to taste real ramen♪ Shuuji: ...... Nene: Umm... What is this?  Shuuji: An extra large char siu ramen with noodles firm and spicy, extra veggies, and extra extra garlic oil. Nene: But, the thing is, I don't see the noodles. Where are they? Shuuji: Beneath that mountain of vegetables somewhere. Nene: ...This isn't ramen like I know it.  Shuuji: Well, this isn't regular ramen. It's the \"Taroumaru\" style of ramen.  Nene: Ramen... Nene: Ah, goodness! I can't mope around like this; That would be a definite breach of the sacred ramen etiquette! I have to start eating.  Shuuji: What?! Sacred ramen etiquette?! Nene: No. I was the one who ordered it, so I'll eat all of it. Well then, without further ado.  Shuuji: Well, at first, yeah. Oh, and you ate the vegetables. That's not part of the ramen.  Shuuji: True.  Shuuji: %130;HOW IN―?! Guest A: Yer frickin' kidding... That lass ate everything, even the soup... Guest B: And she's as slim as a twig?! Guest C: But boy is she a looker... Help, boys, I'm fallin' in love! Nene: D-Do you need something? You're staring at me, and it's making me rather embarrassed.  Nene: Is there something on my face, perhaps?  Shuuji: No, not that. I was just wondering, like... how does that slim body of yours even hold all that food... Guest A: Who IS that girl, seriously?! Guest B: Man, I don't even think I'd be able to eat all that.  Guest C: ...I wanna have an eating contest with her! Nene: ......? The other customers seem to be talking amongst themselves about something. Do you know why?  Shuuji: Probably. They just witnessed the birth of a new legend.  Nene: Huh... A legend, you say...? Nene: That and then some. It was simply delicious. But, ugh... I think I may have overeaten just a little bit.  Shuuji: Just a LITTLE...? Nene: My stomach's so full I might not be able to fit anything else in the rest of the day. It was very worthwhile coming here. Nene: And, of course, I have to thank you for accompanying me.  Shuuji: My pleasure.  Nene: Thanks to you, this won't be nagging at my chest anymore... I feel relieved. Guest B: And she ate so gracefully too... Damn, I'm a jealous man.  Guest C: I wanna challenge her to an eat-off.  Nene: I don't know why... but I feel like we're drawing a lot of attention.  Shuuji: Ah... yeah... Nene: Come on. Shuuji: I-I'm coming... Shuuji: What do you mean?  Nene: Well, so many people were staring at me... So I had the idea that maybe I'd done something disrespectful or rude.  Shuuji: No, you didn't do anything wrong. They were looking at you out of admiration. Nene: But for what reason? All I did was eat a bowl of ramen.  Shuuji: That was no ordinary bowl of ramen, though.  Nene: ......? I'm still somewhat confused, but it's good to know that they at least weren't angry at me, or sneering at me.   Shuuji: Oh, I forgot to ask. How's your stomach? Does it hurt any?  Nene: No, it feels quite fine. The only thing my chest is full of right now is joy and content *siigh*... Nene: What's wrong, Hoshina-kun? Shuuji: Ah, nothing. Glad to hear you liked it; I enjoyed mine too. It was a pretty fun time, all things considered.  Nene: I feel the same. Really, though... It feels like I have fun whatever I'm doing when you're there too.  Shuuji: Wh-Where'd that come from... Could you explain that a little more?  Nene: Well, we have many more members in the club now, and I got to go to the ramen place I've been longing to try. It's just been new experiences day after day... I enjoy my life a lot more.  Shuuji: R-Really? Nene: Yes. That's the honest truth.  Shuuji: Come to think of it, it's the same for me. I've made so many new experiences since joining the club. Hanging out with girls outside of school, participating in a school event, and so on and so forth.  Shuuji: My life would've been a million times duller if I hadn't made the decision to be more social and outgoing.  Nene: Huh? Oh, hardly. I haven't done anything quite that special.  Shuuji: Oh, but you have. Also, not as a repayment or anything, but if you ever feel scared to go someplace alone again... Just ask me, and I'll gladly come with you.  Nene: ...Er, umm... but... Nene: ...... Nene: Can I... hold you to that, then? Shuuji: Of course. Just hit me up whenever.  Nene: Thank you! Haha.  Shuuji: Of course, that's only if you don't mind me tagging along.  Nene: Why would I mind? Remember what I just told you? Every moment is fun when I'm with you.  Shuuji: O-Oh, uh, thanks. Shuuji: I'm in the same boat as you. Ever since I joined the OC, and became friends with you, I've been having so much fun. Nene: ―――! Nene: Th-Thank... you... Nene: Y-Yes. We ended club early today so I could go home and get rested up. It would be disrespectful to the rest of the club members if I stayed out late wandering around town.  Shuuji: Huh? Nene: Look, over there. That has to be her.  Shuuji: Oh, you're right. Shuuji: Yeah, better not disturb them if they're on a date.  Nene: Let's hurry and be on our way before she sees us.  Shuuji: That's the smartest idea, yeah.  Shuuji: Good to hear.  Nene: Make sure you get a good night's rest too, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Sure thing. Well, Ayachi-san, see you at school tomorrow. Goodnight.  Nene: Goodnight.  Nene: ...... Nene: Ack!! Wh-What did I just SAY?! "

Stop reminiscing and get in your seats. I wanna get homeroom over with quickly.  Hideaki: Yes ma'am.  Kanae: You too, Hoshina.  Shuuji: Ah, sorry.  Nene: I'm sorry... I only participated as a pinch hitter. Schoolgirl D: But you can sing SO good, girl! With you, we could seriously become an international sensation!! Nene: I appreciate your kind words, I do... but I'm really sorry. I have no intention of singing any further. Schoolgirl D: Man, that's a bummer... I was ready to be a star.  Schoolgirl D: But if you ever change your mind, I'm always up for it! I'll wait for you, no matter how long it takes! Nene: U-Uhm, yes... Thank you.  Touko: Here, have some tea. I imagine you must be pretty exhausted.  Nene: Thank you, Togakushi-senpai. Touko: The only thing at home I can do is study, and doing that all day just turns my brain to mush. I'm sure you know that feeling.  Touko: So, if you guys don't mind, would it be alright if I stayed and helped the OC out?  Tsumugi: Only if you count the clubroom. If you count all the people that asked her in the classroom during school, it's way more than three.  Nene: It has been quite the day... Shuuji: ...Definitely. I can tell that just by looking at you. Touko: Well, it'll all die down soon. We just have to wait for word to spread that Ayachi-san won't keep singing.  Meguru: But still, she might get random requests to come fill for people if they lose a vocalist or something. Can't count out that possibility.  Nene: ...I really wouldn't like that. I never even expected to receive this much attention in the first place... It almost makes me wish I hadn't done this.  Touko: And I gotta imagine you'll get another rush of invitations once the cultural festival comes around next year.  Nene: Don't say that, Togakushi-senpai. Now I have to worry about that actually happening.  Touko: Oh, I'm sorry. But still, being prepared for it ahead of time isn't such a bad idea.  Nene: D-Don't worry, I have an excuse. I'll just tell them that the Occult Club is going to be doing a performance.  Shuuji: Let's hope that's enough to dissuade them.  Tsumugi: No need to worry about it now, you have time. A lot of things can change in a year, so you might as well just worry about it when the time comes.  Shuuji: True. We can't really make predictions about events that far off in the future.  Nene: Still... Just thinking about the possibility is enough to make me depressed... *sigh* Touko: How long do you guys usually stay?  Nene: It can vary depending on things, but generally, I would say we leave around six.  Shuuji: Do you wanna just call it a day now? We can do that. I know several of the sports teams end around this time too.  Touko: Good idea. I imagine Ayachi-san wants to go on home and lay down.  Meguru: We don't have to stay if you don't want to, Nene-senpai. Tsumugi: And don't forget, this is a weekday. Don't you want to be well-rested for school tomorrow? Nene: Okay... If you all have no reservations, then I suppose we can end things here for today.  Meguru: Alright, then see you guys tomorrow!  Nene: See you tomorrow. Shuuji: Alright... I got the milk, and I got the kinpira burdock. Clerk: Alright, here you are! That'll be 605 Yen. Shuuji: Here.  Clerk: 605 exactly. Thank you, thank you. Please come see us again. Shuuji: Phew, NOW I'm done. Time to go on home and get some din?Hm? Nene: ...... Nene: Huh? Ah, hello, Hoshina-kun! What are you doing here? Shuuji: Nothing much. Just doing some shopping before dinner. What're you up to?  Shuuji: I noticed you pacing around for some time.  Nene: Y-You just stood there and watched? Why didn't you come up and say something sooner... Shuuji: Sorry, I was just a little confused, so I wound up staring. Are you out grocery shopping too? Nene: No, not quite. Today was pretty exhausting for me, so I was thinking of maybe going somewhere... Shuuji: Ah, yeah, I feel that. Sometimes you just don't wanna bother with whipping up something yourself.  Shuuji: ...Ramen? Nene: I told you not to look... Shuuji: S-Sorry. But really, I don't see anything to be embarrassed about.  Nene: You really don't think it's... strange or anything? You can't tell me a girl eating at a ramen restaurant all by herself doesn't weird you out.  Shuuji: Oh no, not at all. I don't see anything wrong with it. Nene: O-Oh, well thank you. Nene: It's not something I love, per se... but I've been curious to explore it.  Nene: Do you remember that day when you and I went with Inaba-san to the conveyor-belt sushi restaurant? Shuuji: Yeah, I do.  Nene: Well, it's much the same scenario... I've never actually been to a ramen restaurant before.  Shuuji: Is that so? Shuuji: You're getting cold feet?  Nene: That's right... I looked in and only saw men dining there, so I got scared.  Nene: But the thing is, I'm not sure I'll ever work up the courage to do this again if I walk away... Shuuji: Is trying this ramen that important to you?  Nene: ...Yes. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Umm... would you like me to come with you? Maybe that would help. Nene: Ah, er, wait... I thought you were going to be eating dinner at home.  Shuuji: Nah, it's all good. None of it'll get cold. Shuuji: And all this talk of ramen's gotten me a little curious... You wouldn't mind if I joined you, would you?  Shuuji: Absolutely. Ready to go on in? Nene: Yes! Shuuji: Coming.  Nene: Ramen! Oh, Ramen! Nene: It'll be my first time having real ramen instead of the cheap, instant kind. I can't wait to see how it tastes. Nene: Is that some sort of problem, perhaps?  Shuuji: Well, before we go in, let me check with you: are you aware of what kind of place this is?  Nene: Come again? I thought it was a ramen place. Is it not? Really? But I'm sure I― Shuuji: Weeell, you could SAY it's a ramen place, but that's not quite the full picture... Let's just say it's a bit of special place. Nene: Oh, you don't have to worry about that. I've done my research prior to coming here.  Shuuji: Really?  Nene: Yes. I have it all down pat. Shuuji: Yeah, a few times with Kaidou.  Shuuji: Ah, yes. Just us two.  Clerk: We got two free seats together, so come on and follow me.  Shuuji: Are you ready, Ayachi-san? Nene: Yes! Clerk: How's it goin', y'all! Shuuji: What are you getting? Nene: The extra large char siu. Shuuji: The extra large?  Nene: Am I not allowed to?  Shuuji: Well, you are, but it's gonna be a lot of food. You sure you can handle it?  Nene: Absolutely. It might seem surprising, but I'm actually a large eater.  Shuuji: Oh, really?  Shuuji: ...Are you sure about that? Nene: Huh? Clerk: Er, yeah, absolutely, miss... W-We'll have that out to ya.  Shuuji: A-Ayachi-san, what are you DOING?! Nene: What? Is something the matter?  Shuuji: A-Are you sure you want that? Like, are you REALLY sure you want that?  Nene: Well... is that not the special code that you chant when ordering it? I read on the internet that first-timers should simply stick to ordering it that way. Shuuji: Man oh man... You actually believed that... Nene: Now it's only a matter of time before it comes out and I get to eat it! Oh, I wonder what it'll taste like... I'm so excited♪ Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Yeah, we've already ordered and everything.  Nene: I feel a little bad. My apologies. But still, I'm glad our path's crossed.  Shuuji: Y-You are...? Nene: Absolutely. I've been eager to eat at this place for so, so long. Nene: Plus enjoying meals with others is something I seldom get the chance to do. It's always nice to have company.  Shuuji: O-Ohh... yeah. Shuuji: Yeah, I'm all good.  Shuuji: That exciting for you?  Nene: Oh, yes! I've had my eyes on this restaurant for so, sooo long. But I could never bring myself to come, you see. Nene: Just to put my frustration into perspective for you, if I had waited a tad bit longer, it might've been possible to retrieve fragments from me. Shuuji: Eh, I don't know, that sounds like a bit of an exaggeration.  Nene: I guarantee you it's not. I'm genuinely happy.   Nene: But, just so you know... If you don't want to stay here with me, you don't have to. You're free to leave anytime.  Shuuji: I don't mind. And if anything, I enjoy hanging out with you.  Nene: Huh...?! Umm, what did you― Shuuji: A-Ah, uhm! I just meant that, like, when I'm with you I don't have to worry about my secret, so it makes me feel relaxed, I guess? Or comfortable? Something like that.  Nene: Ah, yes, of course. Don't worry, I fully understand what you're trying to say.  Nene: And also, I enjoy hanging out with you too, Hoshina-kun.  Shuuji: ―――! Nene: ...... Nene: A-Also, I think I ought to thank you. You've really helped me out in a variety of ways.  Shuuji: Oh, no, I'm not looking for thanks. Really, I should be the one apologizing, considering you still haven't gotten back all your fragments.  Nene: No, that's perfectly alright. They are coming back, slowly but surely.  Nene: Ah! It's finally here♪ I finally get to taste real ramen♪ Shuuji: ...... Nene: Umm... What is this?  Shuuji: An extra large char siu ramen with noodles firm and spicy, extra veggies, and extra extra garlic oil. Nene: But, the thing is, I don't see the noodles. Where are they? Shuuji: Beneath that mountain of vegetables somewhere. Nene: ...This isn't ramen like I know it.  Shuuji: Well, this isn't regular ramen. It's the \"Taroumaru\" style of ramen.  Nene: Ramen... Nene: Ah, goodness! I can't mope around like this; That would be a definite breach of the sacred ramen etiquette! I have to start eating.  Shuuji: What?! Sacred ramen etiquette?! Nene: No. I was the one who ordered it, so I'll eat all of it. Well then, without further ado.  Shuuji: Well, at first, yeah. Oh, and you ate the vegetables. That's not part of the ramen.  Shuuji: True.  Shuuji: %130;HOW IN―?! Guest A: Yer frickin' kidding... That lass ate everything, even the soup... Guest B: And she's as slim as a twig?! Guest C: But boy is she a looker... Help, boys, I'm fallin' in love! Nene: D-Do you need something? You're staring at me, and it's making me rather embarrassed.  Nene: Is there something on my face, perhaps?  Shuuji: No, not that. I was just wondering, like... how does that slim body of yours even hold all that food... Guest A: Who IS that girl, seriously?! Guest B: Man, I don't even think I'd be able to eat all that.  Guest C: ...I wanna have an eating contest with her! Nene: ......? The other customers seem to be talking amongst themselves about something. Do you know why?  Shuuji: Probably. They just witnessed the birth of a new legend.  Nene: Huh... A legend, you say...? Nene: That and then some. It was simply delicious. But, ugh... I think I may have overeaten just a little bit.  Shuuji: Just a LITTLE...? Nene: My stomach's so full I might not be able to fit anything else in the rest of the day. It was very worthwhile coming here. Nene: And, of course, I have to thank you for accompanying me.  Shuuji: My pleasure.  Nene: Thanks to you, this won't be nagging at my chest anymore... I feel relieved. Guest B: And she ate so gracefully too... Damn, I'm a jealous man.  Guest C: I wanna challenge her to an eat-off.  Nene: I don't know why... but I feel like we're drawing a lot of attention.  Shuuji: Ah... yeah... Nene: Come on. Shuuji: I-I'm coming... Shuuji: What do you mean?  Nene: Well, so many people were staring at me... So I had the idea that maybe I'd done something disrespectful or rude.  Shuuji: No, you didn't do anything wrong. They were looking at you out of admiration. Nene: But for what reason? All I did was eat a bowl of ramen.  Shuuji: That was no ordinary bowl of ramen, though.  Nene: ......? I'm still somewhat confused, but it's good to know that they at least weren't angry at me, or sneering at me.   Shuuji: Oh, I forgot to ask. How's your stomach? Does it hurt any?  Nene: No, it feels quite fine. The only thing my chest is full of right now is joy and content *siigh*... Nene: What's wrong, Hoshina-kun? Shuuji: Ah, nothing. Glad to hear you liked it; I enjoyed mine too. It was a pretty fun time, all things considered.  Nene: I feel the same. Really, though... It feels like I have fun whatever I'm doing when you're there too.  Shuuji: Wh-Where'd that come from... Could you explain that a little more?  Nene: Well, we have many more members in the club now, and I got to go to the ramen place I've been longing to try. It's just been new experiences day after day... I enjoy my life a lot more.  Shuuji: R-Really? Nene: Yes. That's the honest truth.  Shuuji: Come to think of it, it's the same for me. I've made so many new experiences since joining the club. Hanging out with girls outside of school, participating in a school event, and so on and so forth.  Shuuji: My life would've been a million times duller if I hadn't made the decision to be more social and outgoing.  Nene: Huh? Oh, hardly. I haven't done anything quite that special.  Shuuji: Oh, but you have. Also, not as a repayment or anything, but if you ever feel scared to go someplace alone again... Just ask me, and I'll gladly come with you.  Nene: ...Er, umm... but... Nene: ...... Nene: Can I... hold you to that, then? Shuuji: Of course. Just hit me up whenever.  Nene: Thank you! Haha.  Shuuji: Of course, that's only if you don't mind me tagging along.  Nene: Why would I mind? Remember what I just told you? Every moment is fun when I'm with you.  Shuuji: O-Oh, uh, thanks. Shuuji: I'm in the same boat as you. Ever since I joined the OC, and became friends with you, I've been having so much fun. Nene: ―――! Nene: Th-Thank... you... Nene: Y-Yes. We ended club early today so I could go home and get rested up. It would be disrespectful to the rest of the club members if I stayed out late wandering around town.  Shuuji: Huh? Nene: Look, over there. That has to be her.  Shuuji: Oh, you're right. Shuuji: Yeah, better not disturb them if they're on a date.  Nene: Let's hurry and be on our way before she sees us.  Shuuji: That's the smartest idea, yeah.  Shuuji: Good to hear.  Nene: Make sure you get a good night's rest too, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Sure thing. Well, Ayachi-san, see you at school tomorrow. Goodnight.  Nene: Goodnight.  Nene: ...... Nene: Ack!!

You used to have the eyes of a dead fish, but now you've passed the point of a resurrected fish all the way to a bouncy, fresh fish. Shuuji: Er, sorry, but I have no idea what you're saying... Taichi: Ah! Something nice must've happened, huh? I see how it is. Maybe you're the fisherman, and you caught someone? You snagged a bouncy, fresh fish for yourself? Shuuji: No, I haven't! Could you stop teasing me first thing in the morning? That's messed― Shuuji: Oh... Give me a moment. I got a text. Shuuji: I've hardly ever used them before, so I don't have a clue what I'm doing― Taichi: Heh... *grin* Shuuji: Ah?! I-It's not like that, Dad! Taichi: Don't worry about me, Son. You meeting up with someone? Or are you having lunch together? Shuuji: Ugh... A-Anyway, I'm sorry but I gotta go now! I'll do the laundry after school, so just leave it be for now! Taichi: Sure. See you later. And good luck! Meguru: Ah! Senpai! Helloha! Shuuji: Pheew... G-Good morning. Meguru: You're breathing pretty heavily. Did you run all the way here? Shuuji: N-No, I didn't. Meguru: Ahaha... Yeah, I just felt like it when I woke up this morning. Meguru: And Senpai, what was up with that emoticon...? Pfft, that made it seem like you were all flustered. Shuuji: Oh, yeah... My bad, Inaba-san. I wanted to use one since you did, but I don't know jack about emoticons... Meguru: ...... Shuuji: H-Huh? Inaba-san? Meguru: *stare* Shuuji: Inaba―Ah! Shuuji: Sorry! Umm... Meguru. Meguru: That's right! I almost thought you forgot already. Meguru: But I'll forgive you since you remembered in the end. Let's go, Senpai! Shuuji: ...Huh? We're going this way again? Meguru: Of course. This way has just become that kinda way for us, you know? Shuuji: That kinda way...? You mean like, a way just for us, so we can talk? Meguru: Haha, actually saying that out loud is so lame. Shuuji: It's really hard to get what sets you off and what doesn't, you know that?! Meguru: I don't know what you're talking about. Meguru: ...Umm, by the way, Senpai. Shuuji: Huh? Wh-What's up? Meguru: You know, there's actually something I'd like to ask of you. That's partly why I texted you. Shuuji: Yeah? What is it? Meguru: You remember how I told you all that stuff on the way home last Friday? Shuuji: Ah... Shuuji: Huh? You mean... Meguru: Umm... From Nene-senpai and the others, I mean. Shuuji: Huh? Go on... Meguru: How do I put this... More importantly than that... Meguru: I just, well... I only want you to know. Shuuji: ...... Meguru: I'm not really sure why myself... Ahaha, yeah... Shuuji: ...Got it. I'll keep it to myself. Meguru: Ah... Shuuji: (I mean, even putting that aside...) Shuuji: (...Sorry, Meguru. I know I just promised you, but...) Shuuji: Yeah, thanks. Shuuji: Well, the thing is... Shuuji: (Do you two know anyone who could search for someone?) Shuuji: (Yeah. I'm trying find someone who went missing.) Nene: (...Is this somehow related to Inaba-san's fragments?) Tsumugi: (Oh, right. Ayachi-san told me about that. That's why you've been so concerned with Meguru-chan lately, right?) Shuuji: (Yeah... That's right.) Shuuji: (I'll give you the details later, but it seems like she her best friend disappeared and she doesn't know where she is.) Tsumugi: (...Really?) Shuuji: (She left without saying goodbye... I think the incident left her scarred. Now I want to find that friend of hers.) Tsumugi: (Oh... She went through all that?) Nene: (...Okay. I understand.) Nene: (I don't know anyone with people finding skills, but I'll at least ask who I can for now.) Tsumugi: (Oh, I'll help out too. Not just because of the fragments. I want to help Meguru-chan.) Shuuji: (Thanks. I really appreciate it.) Tsumugi: (Also, is it okay to tell Togakushi-senpai about this too? She knows a lot of people, so she could be really helpful.) Shuuji: (Yeah, would be great if you could. I can definitely see her being a big help.) Tsumugi: (I'm sure she will! Okay, I'll ask her.) Shuuji: (But one more thing. I would like you to keep this all from her for now.) Nene: (...Why is that?) Shuuji: (Umm... The truth is, she asked me to keep it a secret. Said she doesn't want anyone but me to know since it's embarrassing to her.) Tsumugi: (Oh?) Shuuji: (Besides, we might not be able to find the girl. I don't want to disappoint her or anything. So I'd really appreciate it if you kept quiet about this until we know more.) Nene: (...Alright. Understood.) Tsumugi: (But... Hey, Ayachi-san. This is definitely how I think it is, right?) Nene: (I think so. I can't see it any other way.) Shuuji: (...Huh? What're you talking about?) Tsumugi: (Ahaha, you can be so dense about this stuff.) Tsumugi: (Isn't it obvious? Meguru-chan actually―) Meguru: Excuse me! Tsumugi: Ah?! Meguru: Oh, you're all together! Meguru: Do you really have to ask? I came to hang out. Meguru: Alright! Don't mind me. Meguru: Hey, Nene-senpai, Tsumugi-senpai! I've come over to chat! Shuuji: ...... Tsumugi: H-Huh? With us, you mean? Meguru: You bet. We haven't seen each other or talked since Friday. Meguru: Oh, I'm not bothering you by coming, am I? Tsumugi: N-No! Not at all. Meguru: Ahaha, great! I'm happy to hear that. Nene: Is it okay to ignore Hoshina-kun like that, though? Shuuji: Huh? O-Oh, uh... Meguru: (...! ...!) Tsumugi: I'm pretty sure he didn't say anything... Meguru: Senpai, Senpai. You don't mind, do you? Shuuji: Nah, it's okay, Meguru. If you've come to see the two of them, then I'll let you guys be. Nene, Tsumugi: ...... Meguru: No one said you had to go away or anything. You can stay and watch in silence. Shuuji: Isn't this just bullying?! Meguru: Not at all! I'm just asking you to kindly watch over me. Shuuji: Ugh... Okay, enough with the puppy-dog eyes, Meguru. Meguru: What's the matter? Please watch over me, Senpai! Hideaki: Uh, excuse me. Comment from the peanut gallery, here. Meguru: Huh?! Wh-What the! Wh-Wh-What is it?! Hideaki: Okay, so... Ahem. Hideaki: Isn't Shuuji the only one you're chatting with?! Meguru: Ah... Wakana: Ah, sorry for butting in. I'm Kariya Wakana, and this guy is Kaidou Hideaki. We're Hoshina's friends. Meguru: O-Oh! I'm Inaba Meguru. Wakana: Anyway... Ahem. Wakana: Hoshina, since when have you been calling her by her first name without honorifics?! Shuuji: Ah... Tsumugi: Yes! That's right! I was just thinking that! Nice one, Kariya-san! Nene: So was I. I think we all were wondering about that. Up until now, he has been calling her by her last name with an honorific... Meguru: Ah, er, umm, about that, it's like...! Meguru: Huh? Ah, er... Shuuji: We've become pretty good friends, so I asked if I could start using her first name. Shuuji: And, well, a plain and simple \"Meguru\" without honorifics is what felt right to me, so I just went with that. Hideaki: Huh... I see. Gotta say, that's not like you. Shuuji: Yeah, you're not wrong. But I've never had a junior in a club before, so... Wakana: It didn't feel right treating her like an underclassman forever? Kinda like how they do it in sports clubs. Didn't know you had that side to you, Hoshina. Shuuji: Is there something wrong with that? It's not like this girl holds anything back like a typical underclassman. Wakana: Yeah, I can see that. She seems kinda over-familiar... Oh, sorry, I didn't mean that in a bad way. She just seems quite attached with how she's all \"Senpai, Senpai!\" Nene: So nothing special happened between you two that led to you calling her by her first name? Tsumugi: That's kind of a bummer... Shuuji: Y-Yeah, nothing special happened! Right, Meguru? Meguru: Huh?! D-Dat's right! Shuuji: Anyway, isn't it about time for you to head back to your classroom? Lunch break is almost over. Meguru: Ah... Oh yeah! I'll do that! Meguru: I-I'm leaving then! See you all later! Meguru: So I thought, next time I should have you come over to my place instead. Shuuji: I can't turn you down when you put it like that. Shuuji: Well, we're both ditching club for the day to do this... Meguru: But Nene-senpai said that it was okay. Shuuji: Yeah, I guess. Shuuji: (......) Shuuji: (I'm trying my best to ignore that delicious bittersweet taste from earlier.) Shuuji: Huh, you live pretty close to the station. Meguru: We could have passed through the shopping district to get to my place too, but I thought it'd be better to take a route that's easier to remember. Shuuji: ...Does that mean there is going to be a second time? Meguru: Why do you always have to ask these things out loud? Seriously, Senpai... Man. Shuuji: Wh-What's so bad about it? That's just how important it is. Meguru: O-Oh, it's important? Shuuji: Sure is. At least to me. Meguru: ...You don't ever change, do you? Shuuji: What's that supposed to mean? Meguru: Ah, we have to turn the corner here. Shuuji: Oh... Meguru: We're there. This is my house. Shuuji: Huh? Sure... Meguru: I'm baaack! Shuuji: It's about damn―Bueeh?! Shuuji: ...... Meguru: Senpai, you should see the look on your face right now. Shuuji: I mean, it didn't even cross my mind that you'd make me wait just to change again... Meguru: I like to kick back and relax at home, so I went ahead and changed into something more comfortable. Shuuji: Then why didn't you come to meet me in those clothes?!  Meguru: Because this way I get to surprise you. I knew you'd never expect me to change a second time. Shuuji: This was seriously all part of your plan? You sure went out of your way... Meguru: Really, though, this is loungewear. I can't wear this stuff outside. Meguru: So, what do you think? Surprised? Shuuji: Yeah, I really didn't expect you to change a second time. Though, your new getup is surprising too. You give off a completely different vibe than usual in that outfit. Meguru: That's right. Hehe. That surprise you too? Well, you had no way of knowing since I never told you. Meguru: Do the glasses make a big difference?  Shuuji: Hmm... They do make you look more plain than usual. Meguru: This is how I always looked before entering Himematsu. Shuuji: ...You mean, before your makeover? Meguru: Yep! Standing before you is an elusive Meguru that hardly anyone else gets to see. Meguru: It's gotten kinda embarrassing to show myself in public like this now. I look way too plain. I don't want to come off as a slob. Shuuji: ...But you're okay looking like this in front of me? Meguru: Hehehe. I'm making an exception for you. Your reactions are worth it! Meguru: I'd like you to keep this a secret as well. Shuuji: Y-Yeah, sure... Shuuji: That's a pretty sweet weapon, but I'm a lance player. Not like getting that gun would do me any good. Meguru: What the heck? Why aren't you jealous?! Meguru: Well, whatever. I know you'll think differently after Lavie here saves your butt with her shiny new weapon.  Shuuji: Guh. Well, yeah, I'm pretty much relying on you to carry me... as always... Shuuji: Gotta say, though. Playing with each other while sitting face-to-face is a completely different experience. Meguru: Right? This way you won't get horrifically murderized when you try to thank me! Shuuji: You didn't have to bring that up again, Lavie-san! Meguru: Sorry, but it was too funny. I don't think I'll ever forget how you just stopped and got your face kicked in. Shuuji: I was actually moved by how skilled yet kind the mysterious Lavie-san was... I was shocked when I saw who was behind the character. Meguru: What the heck? I'm not any different from Lavie! Just look at how good she is at coordinating her outfit. Shuuji: Can't deny that. That armor set is pretty dang cool. Meguru: I know, right?! I had to do so much grinding to get the whole set. Hehe! Shuuji: The hair and armor colors even match. It's kinda hot, or more like sexy... Nice job. Meguru: How could you say that to the person playing the character? Gross. Shuuji: I was just trying to compliment your fashion sense, since you seem to take pride in that... Meguru: Ugh... Meguru: Th-Then you should say that about me instead. Shuuji: Huh? Meguru: Don't \"huh\" me! What's with that answer? Don't you want to compliment me? Meguru: Lavie's player is, umm... confident about her own fashion as well... Shuuji: Oh, you look pretty sexy too. Meguru: Buh?! Wh-Wh-Wh-What're you saying?! Shuuji: Well, just look at how you're always showing off your legs... Meguru: M-M-Maybe, but... we're talking about my fashion sense! Not my legs! Shuuji: But going with bare legs is an intentional decision, isn't it? That's a conscious fashion choice. Meguru: Okay, true! But still! Ahh, geez! Shuuji: When I first saw you at school, I thought you looked like a bit of a floozy. But on closer inspection, it's really more of a casual cute style. Meguru: ...... Shuuji: I can tell you put some serious thought into picking a jumper that would match with your uniform. You give off a vibrant, playful vibe, like that of a younger girl. It's really fitting for you. Meguru: Y-Yeah? Ehehe, I spent a lot of time coordinating that outfit. It's my pride and joy♪ Meguru: Senpai, Senpai, praise me more! Shuuji: Sorry, but that's all I got. I'm having trouble remembering anything else to say from the fashion magazines I flipped through... Meguru: ...There goes most of the goodwill you just garnered. Shuuji: You're pretty easy to flatter, huh? Meguru: And there goes the rest. Shuuji: Sorry, I went a little too far there... Meguru: Whatever. Let's just go and do a quest. Shuuji: Oh, okay... I guess I'll back you up... Meguru: Pfft, haha... You don't have to act so depressed. Shuuji: Ah, you cheering up again? Meguru: Geez, I don't believe you. Yeah, I'll cheer up and shoot you full healing bullets～ Shuuji: Huh? Did you make these just for me...? Meguru: No, I made them yesterday. I was just in the mood for it. Shuuji: Ah... Still, though. Thanks. I'll dig right in. Meguru: Yeah, go ahead! Shuuji: ...Oh, this is great! It's sweet and sour, but also has a slightly bitter aftertaste. I really like it. Meguru: Oh, awesome! Meguru: Hearing everyone's impression is the best part of making any dessert. Shuuji: No, really, you're seriously good at this. Every treat of yours I've eaten has been delicious. Shuuji: You're a pretty good cook in general, aren't you? Like in MonHun, you've got quite a few hidden talents. Meguru: Oh, thank... Well, umm... Meguru: I guess you could say I'm a bit of a homebody. I tend to spend most of my free time at home. Shuuji: Oh, I see. That makes sense... Meguru: Yeah, basically. Shuuji: What kind of books do you like? The genres on your shelf seem all over the place. Meguru: Good question... I don't have specific preferences. I read pretty much everything. Shuuji: Huh... Got any examples? Meguru: The last thing I read was an Irish poem collection. Before that was some celebrity's street food travelogue, and before that an isekai harem light novel, I think? Shuuji: Holy crap, that spread... You'll read just about anything, huh? Meguru: Lately though I've been playing games a lot more than reading. I play stuff other than MonHun too. Shuuji: Yeah, I see the console. Oh... l-looks like you're into otome games. Meguru: Heck yeah. With headphones on! Those sexy male voices make my heart pound in ways that― Meguru: Wait, how did you know?! Shuuji: Err, there's what looks like one laying out in the open over there... Meguru: Huh?! Aaah! I-I forgot to put it awaaay! Shuuji: I-It's okay! I play that kinda stuff too! Meguru: What?! You're a guy who plays otome games?! Shuuji: No, I tend to play games aimed at guys... Meguru: For guys...? Y-You mean porn games? Ugh, you actually play that filth? You're the worst... Shuuji: What an absurd double standard. Don't just assume that any visual novel for guys is an adult PC game! There's a lot of perfectly normal stuff on consoles! Shuuji: Wait, why do you even know about those kinds of games...? Meguru: Uhh... Shuuji: You actually play those, don't you?! Meguru: I-I do not! How dare you suggest that?! I've had enough of your super-perv antics! Shuuji: Don't pretend like you're not accusing me of the same thing! This is such a double standard! Shuuji: No, thank you. For the tart, and― Meguru's Mom: Oh my, you're going home already? Meguru: Wha?! Shuuji: Oh, uh, yes! Thanks for having me! Meguru: M-Mom!! Why did you come out?! Meguru's Mom: This is the first friend you've brought over in so long. Of course I'd want to say hello! Meguru's Mom: And it's a boy too? How exciting! Meguru: Geez! I thought I told you to stay clear! Besides, you're getting the wrong idea! Meguru: It's not like you think! He's just an upperclassman from my club! Meguru's Mom: Thank you for taking care of my daughter. Ahh, I wish my husband was here to see you too... Meguru: Mooom! Geeez! Shuuji: Er, I really need to go now! You'll have to let me off for today! Thanks again! Shuuji: ...... Nene: Huh? Is that you, Hoshina-kun? Shuuji: Oh... Hey there, Ayachi-san. On your way home? Nene: Yes. The sun was setting, so we called it a day. Nene: Weren't you supposed to be somewhere with Inaba-san? Shuuji: Yeah, but we called it a day for the same reason. Nene: I see... Shuuji: Yeah... Nene: ...... Nene: I've got some news, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Ah... Wh-What is it? Nene: It seems that Togakushi-senpai is willing to help us. Shuuji: Huh? You mean... Nene: About Inaba-san's missing friend. Shuuji: ...... Nene: Since Inaba-san's friend was her classmate, Togakushi-senpai said she would get in touch with some people she knows from the schools near their old one and have them check the student registers there. Shuuji: I see... Nene: ...Hoshina-kun? Shuuji: Yeah... Meguru: \"I'd like you to keep this a secret as well.\" Shuuji: (But if there's a thorn still stuck in her heart, I want to remove it for her.) Shuuji: \"W-Well, yeah... We do...\" Meguru: \"So I feel a certain kinship with you.\" Shuuji: Are you free right now? This would be a good time for me to share the details. "

I'm supposed to call her by her first name now. Shuuji: Meguru... Meguru... Okay... Shuuji: The taste from... Meguru... Shuuji: Huh? D-Does it? Taichi: Yeah. You used to have the eyes of a dead fish, but now you've passed the point of a resurrected fish all the way to a bouncy, fresh fish. Shuuji: Er, sorry, but I have no idea what you're saying... Taichi: Ah! Something nice must've happened, huh? I see how it is. Maybe you're the fisherman, and you caught someone? You snagged a bouncy, fresh fish for yourself? Shuuji: No, I haven't! Could you stop teasing me first thing in the morning? That's messed― Shuuji: Oh... Give me a moment. I got a text. Shuuji: I've hardly ever used them before, so I don't have a clue what I'm doing― Taichi: Heh... *grin* Shuuji: Ah?! I-It's not like that, Dad! Taichi: Don't worry about me, Son. You meeting up with someone? Or are you having lunch together? Shuuji: Ugh... A-Anyway, I'm sorry but I gotta go now! I'll do the laundry after school, so just leave it be for now! Taichi: Sure. See you later. And good luck! Meguru: Ah! Senpai! Helloha! Shuuji: Pheew... G-Good morning. Meguru: You're breathing pretty heavily. Did you run all the way here? Shuuji: N-No, I didn't. Meguru: Ahaha... Yeah, I just felt like it when I woke up this morning. Meguru: And Senpai, what was up with that emoticon...? Pfft, that made it seem like you were all flustered. Shuuji: Oh, yeah... My bad, Inaba-san. I wanted to use one since you did, but I don't know jack about emoticons... Meguru: ...... Shuuji: H-Huh? Inaba-san? Meguru: *stare* Shuuji: Inaba―Ah! Shuuji: Sorry! Umm... Meguru. Meguru: That's right! I almost thought you forgot already. Meguru: But I'll forgive you since you remembered in the end. Let's go, Senpai! Shuuji: ...Huh? We're going this way again? Meguru: Of course. This way has just become that kinda way for us, you know? Shuuji: That kinda way...? You mean like, a way just for us, so we can talk? Meguru: Haha, actually saying that out loud is so lame. Shuuji: It's really hard to get what sets you off and what doesn't, you know that?! Meguru: I don't know what you're talking about. Meguru: ...Umm, by the way, Senpai. Shuuji: Huh? Wh-What's up? Meguru: You know, there's actually something I'd like to ask of you. That's partly why I texted you. Shuuji: Yeah? What is it? Meguru: You remember how I told you all that stuff on the way home last Friday? Shuuji: Ah... Shuuji: Huh? You mean... Meguru: Umm... From Nene-senpai and the others, I mean. Shuuji: Huh? Go on... Meguru: How do I put this... More importantly than that... Meguru: I just, well... I only want you to know. Shuuji: ...... Meguru: I'm not really sure why myself... Ahaha, yeah... Shuuji: ...Got it. I'll keep it to myself. Meguru: Ah... Shuuji: (I mean, even putting that aside...) Shuuji: (...Sorry, Meguru. I know I just promised you, but...) Shuuji: Yeah, thanks. Shuuji: Well, the thing is... Shuuji: (Do you two know anyone who could search for someone?) Shuuji: (Yeah. I'm trying find someone who went missing.) Nene: (...Is this somehow related to Inaba-san's fragments?) Tsumugi: (Oh, right. Ayachi-san told me about that. That's why you've been so concerned with Meguru-chan lately, right?) Shuuji: (Yeah... That's right.) Shuuji: (I'll give you the details later, but it seems like she her best friend disappeared and she doesn't know where she is.) Tsumugi: (...Really?) Shuuji: (She left without saying goodbye... I think the incident left her scarred. Now I want to find that friend of hers.) Tsumugi: (Oh... She went through all that?) Nene: (...Okay. I understand.) Nene: (I don't know anyone with people finding skills, but I'll at least ask who I can for now.) Tsumugi: (Oh, I'll help out too. Not just because of the fragments. I want to help Meguru-chan.) Shuuji: (Thanks. I really appreciate it.) Tsumugi: (Also, is it okay to tell Togakushi-senpai about this too? She knows a lot of people, so she could be really helpful.) Shuuji: (Yeah, would be great if you could. I can definitely see her being a big help.) Tsumugi: (I'm sure she will! Okay, I'll ask her.) Shuuji: (But one more thing. I would like you to keep this all from her for now.) Nene: (...Why is that?) Shuuji: (Umm... The truth is, she asked me to keep it a secret. Said she doesn't want anyone but me to know since it's embarrassing to her.) Tsumugi: (Oh?) Shuuji: (Besides, we might not be able to find the girl. I don't want to disappoint her or anything. So I'd really appreciate it if you kept quiet about this until we know more.) Nene: (...Alright. Understood.) Tsumugi: (But... Hey, Ayachi-san. This is definitely how I think it is, right?) Nene: (I think so. I can't see it any other way.) Shuuji: (...Huh? What're you talking about?) Tsumugi: (Ahaha, you can be so dense about this stuff.) Tsumugi: (Isn't it obvious? Meguru-chan actually―) Meguru: Excuse me! Tsumugi: Ah?! Meguru: Oh, you're all together! Meguru: Do you really have to ask? I came to hang out. Meguru: Alright! Don't mind me. Meguru: Hey, Nene-senpai, Tsumugi-senpai! I've come over to chat! Shuuji: ...... Tsumugi: H-Huh? With us, you mean? Meguru: You bet. We haven't seen each other or talked since Friday. Meguru: Oh, I'm not bothering you by coming, am I? Tsumugi: N-No! Not at all. Meguru: Ahaha, great! I'm happy to hear that. Nene: Is it okay to ignore Hoshina-kun like that, though? Shuuji: Huh? O-Oh, uh... Meguru: (...! ...!) Tsumugi: I'm pretty sure he didn't say anything... Meguru: Senpai, Senpai. You don't mind, do you? Shuuji: Nah, it's okay, Meguru. If you've come to see the two of them, then I'll let you guys be. Nene, Tsumugi: ...... Meguru: No one said you had to go away or anything. You can stay and watch in silence. Shuuji: Isn't this just bullying?! Meguru: Not at all! I'm just asking you to kindly watch over me. Shuuji: Ugh... Okay, enough with the puppy-dog eyes, Meguru. Meguru: What's the matter? Please watch over me, Senpai! Hideaki: Uh, excuse me. Comment from the peanut gallery, here. Meguru: Huh?! Wh-What the! Wh-Wh-What is it?! Hideaki: Okay, so... Ahem. Hideaki: Isn't Shuuji the only one you're chatting with?! Meguru: Ah... Wakana: Ah, sorry for butting in. I'm Kariya Wakana, and this guy is Kaidou Hideaki. We're Hoshina's friends. Meguru: O-Oh! I'm Inaba Meguru. Wakana: Anyway... Ahem. Wakana: Hoshina, since when have you been calling her by her first name without honorifics?! Shuuji: Ah... Tsumugi: Yes! That's right! I was just thinking that! Nice one, Kariya-san! Nene: So was I. I think we all were wondering about that. Up until now, he has been calling her by her last name with an honorific... Meguru: Ah, er, umm, about that, it's like...! Meguru: Huh? Ah, er... Shuuji: We've become pretty good friends, so I asked if I could start using her first name. Shuuji: And, well, a plain and simple \"Meguru\" without honorifics is what felt right to me, so I just went with that. Hideaki: Huh... I see. Gotta say, that's not like you. Shuuji: Yeah, you're not wrong. But I've never had a junior in a club before, so... Wakana: It didn't feel right treating her like an underclassman forever? Kinda like how they do it in sports clubs. Didn't know you had that side to you, Hoshina. Shuuji: Is there something wrong with that? It's not like this girl holds anything back like a typical underclassman. Wakana: Yeah, I can see that. She seems kinda over-familiar... Oh, sorry, I didn't mean that in a bad way. She just seems quite attached with how she's all \"Senpai, Senpai!\" Nene: So nothing special happened between you two that led to you calling her by her first name? Tsumugi: That's kind of a bummer... Shuuji: Y-Yeah, nothing special happened! Right, Meguru? Meguru: Huh?! D-Dat's right! Shuuji: Anyway, isn't it about time for you to head back to your classroom? Lunch break is almost over. Meguru: Ah... Oh yeah! I'll do that! Meguru: I-I'm leaving then! See you all later! Meguru: So I thought, next time I should have you come over to my place instead. Shuuji: I can't turn you down when you put it like that. Shuuji: Well, we're both ditching club for the day to do this... Meguru: But Nene-senpai said that it was okay. Shuuji: Yeah, I guess. Shuuji: (......) Shuuji: (I'm trying my best to ignore that delicious bittersweet taste from earlier.) Shuuji: Huh, you live pretty close to the station. Meguru: We could have passed through the shopping district to get to my place too, but I thought it'd be better to take a route that's easier to remember. Shuuji: ...Does that mean there is going to be a second time? Meguru: Why do you always have to ask these things out loud? Seriously, Senpai... Man. Shuuji: Wh-What's so bad about it? That's just how important it is. Meguru: O-Oh, it's important? Shuuji: Sure is. At least to me. Meguru: ...You don't ever change, do you? Shuuji: What's that supposed to mean? Meguru: Ah, we have to turn the corner here. Shuuji: Oh... Meguru: We're there. This is my house. Shuuji: Huh? Sure... Meguru: I'm baaack! Shuuji: It's about damn―Bueeh?! Shuuji: ......

Shuuji: Yeah... Nene: ...... Nene: I've got some news, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Ah... Wh-What is it? Nene: It seems that Togakushi-senpai is willing to help us. Shuuji: Huh? You mean... Nene: About Inaba-san's missing friend. Shuuji: ...... Nene: Since Inaba-san's friend was her classmate, Togakushi-senpai said she would get in touch with some people she knows from the schools near their old one and have them check the student registers there. Shuuji: I see... Nene: ...Hoshina-kun? Shuuji: Yeah... Meguru: \"I'd like you to keep this a secret as well.\" Shuuji: (But if there's a thorn still stuck in her heart, I want to remove it for her.) Shuuji: \"W-Well, yeah... We do...\" Meguru: \"So I feel a certain kinship with you.\" Shuuji: Are you free right now?

            "Meguru: Hey, guess what? I brought cupcakes! Tsumugi, Touko: Oooh♪ Tsumugi: Oh, yeah. Your cookies and pudding were great! I'm sure your cupcakes are good too. Meguru: They turned out pretty well, I think. Alright, here you go, Tsumugi-senpai! Tsumugi: Wow♪ Thanks～ Meguru: Togakushi-senpai, here's yours! Touko: Ooh♪ This is such a wonderful surprise. Thank you. Nene: Can I try one as well? Meguru: Of course you can! I made a ton of 'em. There's no way I'd leave you out!  Meguru: So here, take one! Nene: Thank you very much. I'll have a taste. Shuuji: Oh... Thanks. A girl's homemade cupcake, huh... Meguru: I'm sure you'll like it. Shuuji: You've been pretty cheerful lately, I have to say. Meguru: Yeah, thanks to you. Tsumugi: Oh! It's great, Meguru-chan! Meguru: Really? I'm glad you like it! Touko: It's so moist and fluffy. You didn't just use some pre-packaged mix, right? I can tell you put some real effort into these. The nuts are a great touch. Nene: It's really good, Inaba-san. This tastes just as good as the stuff they sell at bakeries.  Meguru: Wow! Nene-senpai, that's so nice of you to say! Nene: Sh-Shouldn't you sit and eat your own share? Meguru: Oh, well, maybe you should feed me. Just kidding! Nene: ...? What's the matter, Inaba-san? Meguru: Oh, nothing! Meguru: Okay, I'll eat mine now. Nene: Alright, let's call it a day here. Tsumugi: 'Kay! Meguru: Ahaha. You're welcome. Shuuji: Welp, time to head home. Meguru: Ah, Senpai, Senpai. Meguru: Are you free after this? Shuuji: I guess, yeah. Meguru: Then, well... let's go home together! Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Umm... Is this another cupcake? Meguru: Y-You don't want it? Shuuji: Of course I do! I was just surprised. Shuuji: Umm... You went out of your way to make me an extra one? Meguru: ...Well, you're the one I made that promise with. Shuuji: Y-Yeah, I guess. Shuuji: Oh... Meguru: I-I'm the one thanking you, here. Meguru: Come on. Hurry up and eat it. Go, go. Shuuji: Yeah, thanks. I can't wait! Shuuji: No, you did good! It's just a little messy because I can't stop smiling while I eat. Meguru: ...... Shuuji: *munch* *munch* Yeah, it's great. This tastes awesome, Inaba-san. Meguru: ...E-Ehehehe. Meguru: Ah! Now you're making me smile and laugh too, geez! Shuuji: Huh? How is that my fault? Meguru: 'Cuz what kind of dope smiles while they eat? Meguru: You're welcome. Shuuji: Though, to be honest... I wish I had something to drink along with it. It tasted great, but now my mouth is dry. Meguru: Oh... Y-You're right! I'm sorry I didn't think of that! Meguru: Umm, there's a vending machine down the side street we talked on the other day, right? Let's go! Shuuji: Nah, no need to take a detour just for that. I was only half serious, anyway. Meguru: Oh, okay, right... Meguru: Yeah...? Shuuji: I'll take that detour after all. Wanna tag along? I wouldn't mind chatting more with you. Meguru: Ah... Meguru: Yeah! Of course! Meguru: There we go. Meguru: Hm? What's wrong, Senpai? Shuuji: Oh, nothing. Shuuji: For sure. Meguru: That's good. I was afraid you wouldn't want to eat any of my treats anymore. Shuuji: I'd never turn down more treats from you. It'd be awesome if I could have more sometime. Meguru: Roger that. Next time I'll make something easier to eat. Meguru: So... What did you want to talk about now?  Shuuji: Hm? Meguru: Don't \"hm\" me! Didn't you just say you wanted to chat some more? Shuuji: O-Ohh... Right... Meguru: You want to know? Shuuji: Yeah. After getting this involved, I'm kinda curious. I haven't heard any of the details yet. Meguru: Hmm, let's see... Meguru: Nene-senpai kept chatting away about nothing in particular. Shuuji: Oh yeah? Meguru: Other than that, I made dinner to show my thanks for letting me sleep over... Meguru: Oh, right! We also took a bath together! And even better, it was Nene-senpai who invited me for that! Meguru: And before you ask, we didn't wash each other or anything. But man, Nene-senpai has such a nice figure and pretty skin. I'm a girl and was still totally captivated. It's not fair how she gets to be both slender and voluptuous. Shuuji: Y-You don't say... Meguru: Hey, I know that look! You're picturing her right now, aren't you?! You perv! Shuuji: You can't blame me after you're the one who said all that stuff. Shuuji: Erm, I was picturing you this time. Meguru: WHAT?! Wh-Why me?! Meguru: Why would you imagine ME naked?! Compared to Nene-senpai, I'm basically flat! Shuuji: Well, I think you're both really attractive. A flat girl like you can still be hot! Meguru: ―――?! Shuuji: Err, sorry! This has been really rude of me! Forget I said anything! Meguru: W-Will do. I'll try my best! You... You see, jokes like that don't faze me one bit! Shuuji: Huh? R-Right... Meguru: R-Right! Nene-senpai was worried about whether I'm getting along with my classmates!  Shuuji: Ahh... Meguru: Y-Yeah. True, we took a bath together, ate cake together and all that... Meguru: ...... Shuuji: ...Inaba-san? Meguru: I'm sure you're curious about that too, huh? Shuuji: Huh? A-About what? Meguru: About why I decided to get a makeover when entering Himematsu. Shuuji: Well... Meguru: Yeah. Our conversation ended up there. Meguru: I didn't tell her anything. Shuuji: Huh? Meguru: It's a hard subject for me, so I just sorta glossed over it. Shuuji: ...... Meguru: But it makes me wonder if it's been weighing on her mind. And if it's been weighing on your mind as well... Shuuji: Umm...  Didn't you tell us before that you got a makeover to make yourself more approachable? Meguru: I did, and it's true, but I'm talking about what made me want to do that in the first place. Shuuji: O-Oh. Yeah... Meguru: ...... Meguru: Ah... Meguru: O-Okay. It's not a very enjoyable story, though... Ahaha... Shuuji: I don't mind. I'm just happy that you're willing to tell me. Meguru: ...Thank you. Shuuji: Alright. Go ahead. Meguru: She may have been my only one, but we were really close. We were best friends. Shuuji: ...You didn't have any other friends? Meguru: You know how clingy I can be, right? Well, back then, it was even worse. Meguru: I could be myself around Chi-chan, but not any of the other girls... Shuuji: Chi-chan, huh? Meguru: Yeah. Kizuki Chihoko. I always called her Chi-chan. Meguru: She was a very frail and quiet girl. She was a huge bookworm, though, and was super smart. Meguru: I did nothing but read books too, so we had a shared hobby and matching personalities. Meguru: I could tell her all the things that I couldn't tell anyone else. I told her everything... Meguru: ...But maybe that was the problem. Meguru: To make things worse, I tend to jabber on incessantly when I get excited. Meguru: Basically, I'm completely unfettered when it comes to everyone I'm close with... Shuuji: Yeah, I can see that. Meguru: ...... Meguru: Chi-chan stopped coming to school all of a sudden. Shuuji: Huh? Meguru: I had no idea why. She just stopped coming... Meguru: She never answered my calls or texts either. Meguru: After a while of that, I couldn't take it anymore and went over to her place. Meguru: But when I got there... her house was completely vacant. Shuuji: Huh...? Meguru: So I asked our homeroom teacher, but he wouldn't tell me anything. All he would say was that she left our school. Meguru: And now... I still have no idea where Chi-chan is or what she's currently doing... Shuuji: So... what you're saying is that she suddenly moved away and never told you? Meguru: She didn't tell me anything. She wouldn't even answer my texts or calls. Meguru: But I just figured that it made sense. Shuuji: ...Why's that? Meguru: I said something terrible to Chi-chan right before she stopped coming to school. Meguru: \"I can't get along with anyone else, but you're the only friend I want.\" Meguru: \"It's the same for you, right? So let's be friends forever.\" Shuuji: What's so terrible about that? Meguru: But when I think back on it now, I realize how put off she looked when I said that. Meguru: It was almost like I said something revolting to her... Shuuji: ...... Meguru: That's why I figured it must have been my fault that she didn't tell me anything. Meguru: Maybe it hurt her when I told her she didn't have any other friends than me. Meguru: I would say inconsiderate stuff like that and act like a selfish kid around her all the time. Maybe that was too much for her. Meguru: That must be why she disappeared from my life completely... Shuuji: But... Meguru: Partly because I lost my best friend... Meguru: But also, with Chi-chan gone, I was back to being without a single friend I could open up to. Shuuji: Ah... Meguru: So after that, I just became an introverted bookworm. Meguru: I knew I was too annoying to be good at making friends, so I was too scared to ever try again. Meguru: I also felt like I'd never get a friendship like Chi-chan's again, anyway. Meguru: And besides, not even my best friend Chi-chan wanted to be friends with me anymore. Shuuji: ...I see. Meguru: I decided I couldn't let things continue like that. Shuuji: ...... Meguru: I wanted to get good at socializing and tried my best to achieve that. Meguru: So if I were to meet Chi-chan again... I could apologize to her and tell her that I'm different now. Shuuji: ...And that's why you changed yourself when you entered Himematsu. Meguru: Yeah, exactly. Shuuji: I see... Meguru: ...I-I'm sorry. I just ended up spewing some boring, incomprehensible nonsense! Meguru: L-Let's talk about something else! Umm, err, like about MonHun― Shuuji: No. I get exactly how you feel. Shuuji: I've gone through some stuff and struggled to talk to people too. Shuuji: I've always had hardly any friends. The most I could ever muster was some smalltalk with my classmates. I would just wear a fake smile and try not to upset anyone. Shuuji: It got to the point where, just a little while back, my own dad told me I had the eyes of a dead fish. Meguru: Ah... Shuuji: Yeah, you've thought the same, I'm sure. Meguru: N-No! I would never think anything like that! I just thought you look kinda gloomy. Like you didn't have any friends and stuff... Shuuji: Yeah, that doesn't make it much better. Meguru: I'm sorry! Shuuji: It's alright. After all, it's the truth. Shuuji: But, you see, circumstances led me to joining the OC where I got in touch with everyone else's worries. That made me take a closer look at myself, which led to a thought. Meguru: Wh-Which is...? Shuuji: That I couldn't let things continue like that. Meguru: ...... Shuuji: I mean, I couldn't even muster a decent smile. It was so stiff that even I thought I looked gross. Shuuji: That inspired me to change myself. To give myself a more natural smile... Meguru: ...I see. Meguru: So you're... the same as me... Shuuji: Do you understand how I felt? Meguru: Y-Yeah! I totally do! It's almost like you were talking about me! Shuuji: Thanks. That is why I feel like I can understand your situation so well.   Shuuji: ...Thanks for telling me. Meguru: D-Don't thank me! I should thank you... Meguru: You told me about yourself, listened to my story and understood me. I'm so happy... Shuuji: Then that makes two of us. Meguru: Seems so... Ahahaha... Shuuji: ...... Meguru: ...... Shuuji: I-I guess it's about time we go home. Meguru: R-R-Right, we've been talking all evening... Meguru: Th-This is far enough. Meguru: Yeah. It's only a few minutes from here, and the streets are well-lit. Shuuji: Okay. Then I'll head home. See you on Monday, Inaba-san. Meguru: Yeah... Meguru: ...Oh, wait a moment! One last thing. Shuuji: Huh? What's up? Meguru: Umm... I don't know how to put this, but, umm... Meguru: I-I know you think you haven't been able to smile well... Shuuji: ...Huh? Meguru: But... Meguru: Your smile has never felt unpleasant to me! Shuuji: ...... Meguru: Y-Yeah... Hehe... Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Ready to have a taste of mine this time? Shuuji: Ahaha, yeah of course you― Meguru: But... Meguru: ...Can I ask for something else instead? Shuuji: What? L-Like, you want me to drink the rest of your cafe au lait or something? Meguru: ...... Shuuji: ...Inaba-san? Meguru: Meguru. Meguru: Could you, from today on... start calling me by my given name? Shuuji: ...... Meguru: ...... Meguru: N-Never mind! I take that back! Forget I said anything! Shuuji: M-Meguru. Meguru: Ah... Shuuji: Is that what you wanted? Meguru: A-Again. One more time. Shuuji: ...Meguru. Meguru: ～～～!! Shuuji: ...Hellooo Meguru. Meguru: That's me!

It was so stiff that even I thought I looked gross. Shuuji: That inspired me to change myself. To give myself a more natural smile... Meguru: ...I see. Meguru: So you're... the same as me... Shuuji: Do you understand how I felt? Meguru: Y-Yeah! I totally do! It's almost like you were talking about me! Shuuji: Thanks. That is why I feel like I can understand your situation so well.   Shuuji: ...Thanks for telling me. Meguru: D-Don't thank me! I should thank you... Meguru: You told me about yourself, listened to my story and understood me. I'm so happy... Shuuji: Then that makes two of us. Meguru: Seems so... Ahahaha... Shuuji: ...... Meguru: ...... Shuuji: I-I guess it's about time we go home. Meguru: R-R-Right, we've been talking all evening... Meguru: Th-This is far enough. Meguru: Yeah. It's only a few minutes from here, and the streets are well-lit. Shuuji: Okay. Then I'll head home. See you on Monday, Inaba-san. Meguru: Yeah... Meguru: ...Oh, wait a moment! One last thing. Shuuji: Huh? What's up? Meguru: Umm... I don't know how to put this, but, umm... Meguru: I-I know you think you haven't been able to smile well... Shuuji: ...Huh? Meguru: But... Meguru: Your smile has never felt unpleasant to me! Shuuji: ...... Meguru: Y-Yeah... Hehe... Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Ready to have a taste of mine this time? Shuuji: Ahaha, yeah of course you― Meguru: But... Meguru: ...Can I ask for something else instead? Shuuji: What? L-Like, you want me to drink the rest of your cafe au lait or something? Meguru: ...... Shuuji: ...Inaba-san? Meguru: Meguru. Meguru: Could you, from today on... start calling me by my given name? Shuuji: ...... Meguru: ...... Meguru: N-Never mind! I take that back! Forget I said anything! Shuuji: M-Meguru. Meguru: Ah... Shuuji: Is that what you wanted? Meguru: A-Again. One more time. Shuuji: ...Meguru. Meguru: ～～～!! Shuuji: ...Hellooo Meguru. Meguru: That's me!

            "Touko: Good idea. Let's take a break, everyone. It's not good to strain yourself too much. Tsumugi: Nnngh! I'm so tired... Shuuji: Mh, nnngh... Touko: It's already this late? We must've been concentrating pretty hard. Shuuji: How about we talk about the party? Would make for a nice change of pace. Touko: That's a good idea. Nene: Then I'll go and make us some more tea. Tsumugi: Thanks, Ayachi-san. Shuuji: Hasn't it gotten a little bit dark in here? Meguru: Let's switch on the lights. Nene-senpai, is it okay to switch on the lights?  Nene: Yes, of course it is. I think I left the remote for the lights somewhere near the sofa.  Meguru: Roger that. Meguru: Remote, remote... Nene: You can't find it? Meguru: Give me a few seconds. Umm... Ah, found it. But... Huh? Shuuji: What's wrong? Meguru: ...It's a little different from the one at my home. It's smaller, and only has a few buttons. Shuuji: Wh-What are you holding there, Inaba-san?! Meguru: Well, the remote for the lights? Meguru: Alright, I'll turn on the lights now. Nene: Wait! Inaba-san! Please wait a moment! Meguru: Yeah? Why? Nene: You. Must. Not. Use. That. Switch! Meguru: Why are you talking like a robot? Nene: Who cares! That's not the right switch! It's for something else! You must not press it! Meguru: Oh, really? Then what's this remote for? It doesn't look like a remote for an air conditioner or TV. What is it? Nene: I-It's a remote detonator! Meguru: A remote detonator?! Nene: This room will explode if you press that button! You'd bomb us all! Meguru: Why would you have such a terrifying switch?! Shuuji: L-Look! O-Over here! Isn't this the remote for the lights?! Shuuji: I'll turn on the lights, so you can come back over here now. Meguru: Okay, thanks. Shuuji: Umm, Ayachi-san, here. Nene: ...Thank you, very much. Shuuji: Yeah, uh, don't worry about it. Shuuji: Anyway... Is this the remote for your egg― Nene: %130;Huh? What did you just say? Shuuji: You can't just keep pretending to be a dense anime protagonist whenever you're in trouble. Nene: God... I hate this. I'm going home... Shuuji: You ARE home. Nene: It's not like you think! It's, umm... for when the arousal sometimes comes on especially strongly... I-I don't use it every time! Shuuji: Uh, I never asked you about that. Calm down. Nene: I-It's all that stupid contract's fault! Shuuji: ...Yeah, okay. The contract. Nene: Yes, the contract. Shuuji: ...... Nene: ...... Nene: I can't take this anymore. This can't be happening. This can't be happening. This can't be happening... Death is the only way out now. Shuuji: Calm down. I haven't said anything. Nene: Your look... Your look says it all. It says that I'm a pervert for using an egg vibrator. Shuuji: I'm not thinking anything like that! Shuuji: Though, I WAS wondering why it was still out... Nene: I-It's not like you think! I'm not actually using it right now or anything! I'm not a pervert! Nene: I DID put it away! The egg itself, at least... But apparently I forgot the remote... Shuuji: So, there isn't anything else you forgot to put away, is there? We're all good now, right? Nene: Umm......... Nene: ........................... Nene: W-We're all good! Shuuji: It took you that long to think about it?! And why do you still sound so unsure?! Meguru: How far have you gotten so far? I don't know, since I've been studying the whole time. Nene: We have booked catering for light food, and we have ordered some inexpensive soft drinks over the internet. Nene: As for the party staff, we've discussed it with the Student Council and are currently making a shift plan. There should be no problems there. Nene: We also ordered the decorations on the internet when we ordered the drinks and got permission from the school to store them there upon delivery. Nene: Our overall plan has been to keep costs low by ordering through online stores that have good discounts. We'll only go out and buy the things we overlooked. Meguru: Ooh... Seems like most everything was taken care of while I wasn't paying attention. Touko: Just like I thought, Ayachi-san is very capable. She's so good at this that my help almost seems unnecessary. Nene: That's not true. I'm only able to be this efficient thanks to all the information you gave us. Nene: Except for the program. Meguru: Have we not made any progress there? Touko: We have. Our school's brass band will play at the party. Meguru: But that alone isn't enough? Nene: I wouldn't say that. But it's hard to tell until we actually hold the party. Touko: The party's main guests will be students, so we don't need anything super showy, but it's hard to tell how they'll feel until the party starts. Touko: At least we don't need a full stage schedule like with the cultural festival. Touko: But, just to be on the safe side, it would be better to have something that would fire everyone up with a whoomph.  Tsumugi: With a \"whoomph\"? Meguru: How about cavalry battle? Shuuji: That would certainly liven things up. If it were the sports festival. Meguru: A hotdog eating contest? Shuuji: Why do you keep bringing up typical sports festival events? Meguru: Then, what about a play? Touko: We did consider that. While it works for a cultural festival, wouldn't it be tiring to focus on the stage for too long at a party? Shuuji: Besides, we wouldn't be able to get the Drama Club to put together a show on such short notice. Nene: The third-years have already retired, so the club has their hands full practicing for next spring's cultural festival. Meguru: I see... Oh! Then how about embrace the Halloween theme and, like, do a candy exchange? Meguru: Everyone has to bring some candy, and then they exchange it with each other. Nene: Isn't exchanging sweets something you do on Christmas rather than Halloween? Shuuji: Giving out candy does fit Halloween... Though, that might be a bit daunting if participation is mandatory. Shuuji: Ideally, we want something everyone can participate in at their leisure, and still fun for those who don't participate... Hmmm... Shuuji: Oh, I know! How about a costume contest? Nene: A costume contest? Shuuji: You said that a lot of students wear Halloween costumes at the party, right? Touko: Yeah, a good number of them do every year. Tsumugi: So, you mean make it mandatory this time? Shuuji: No, that's too much to ask for. Shuuji: I'm talking about voting on who put the most effort into their costume, and who looks best in their costume. Meguru: You mean kinda like a beauty contest? Shuuji: Kinda, yeah. Shuuji: It doesn't have to be as grand, though. You'd need to submit your entry, but you wouldn't have to do anything special like presenting yourself on stage. Also, no separate brackets for girls and boys. Shuuji: And, hmm... As for the prizes, maybe something like school cafeteria meal tickets? We can fit that in our budget, right? Nene: Yes, we certainly do have the budget for that... Shuuji: If it's just casting a vote, everyone could participate no problem. Touko: Oh, yes, that's good. That would certainly liven things up. Tsumugi: If there's nothing weird like a swimsuit contest, I feel like a lot of students might participate. Shuuji: Well... I'm worried if we'll get enough participants, actually. Nene: Yeah, I know what you mean. The party could come around only for there to be no one willing to participate. Touko: You don't need to worry about that. There'll be at least five participants. Shuuji: Huh? Do you know anyone who'd participate? Touko: Yup. They're right here. Shuuji: Right here...? Wait, you mean... Shuuji: One...? Meguru: ...Two? Tsumugi: Three? Nene: Four... Touko: And five! Touko: See? We could at least stop the party from getting too awkward if we participate. Shuuji: Ahh, yeah. Touko: Not at all. You're very necessary. You need to show everyone that guys can participate too. Shuuji: Well, I guess that makes sense. Tsumugi: But that means that us five will definitely have to wear costumes, right? Meguru: More or less, yeah. Tsumugi: You... don't seem very bothered by it. Don't you think it's embarrassing? Or maybe you're an avid cosplayer? Meguru: No, it'll be my first time. I mean, it's a little embarrassing... But don't you think costumes will make the party more fun? Meguru: We'll have to help run the party the whole time anyway, so we might as well have fun with it. Tsumugi: Yeah... I guess. Meguru: Besides, it's not like you have to wear some kind of super sexy costume. Meguru: There'll be a lot of other people wearing costumes, so I think it'd be cool to give it a shot as well. Tsumugi: Well... Yeah, you might have a point. Shuuji: Do you not want to wear a costume, Shiiba-san? Tsumugi: I mean... It's not like I don't want to. It just seems like it'd be really embarrassing. Meguru: We'll be wearing costumes together, Tsumugi-senpai! You hardly ever get a chance like this! Tsumugi: ...... Tsumugi: ...A-As long as the costume isn't too revealing. Meguru: Of course. I don't want to dress in anything embarrassing, myself. Touko: Are you also alright with that, Ayachi-san? Nene: Well... If I don't have to wear anything weird that stands out too much, then I have no objections. Meguru: How are we going to get our costumes? Touko: Ah, leave that to me! I'll get costumes for all of us ready. Nene: Huh? But... Touko: Specifically, I want to ask the Fashion Design Club. So you all don't have to worry about your costumes. Tsumugi: Even if it's the Fashion Design Club, won't it be hard for them to prepare this many costumes on such short notice? Touko: It won't be a problem if I ask them now. I'm friends with the club president there, and she's is always talking about how much she likes making clothes for cute girls. Touko: I'm sure she would love to make costumes for you three. She would probably beg me for the honor and would hate me if I didn't ask her. Nene: Okay... Can you take care of that for us, then? Touko: Yup! You bet! Touko: My, this party is starting to sound so fun. Meguru: You said it! Let's make this the best party ever! Touko: Yeah! Nene: Well then, Inaba-san, we better get back to studying so you can actually attend that party. Meguru: Ugh... I'd rather not be reminded... Nene: We were quite productive today, I'd say. Touko: Yeah, we sure were. That was a great study session! Meguru: My head hurts a little from all the concentrating. Nene: Today would be all for naught if you end up forgetting everything. Make sure you review everything if you want it to stick. Meguru: Ugh... I know. Tsumugi: Ayachi-san, thanks for letting us use your apartment. Nene: Don't thank me. I really enjoyed studying together with everyone. Tsumugi: Yeah, I had a ton of fun too! Shuuji: Thanks for helping me study today. Nene: You're very welcome. Usually it's always you helping me out. Touko: Well, Inaba-san, think you can pass your tests now? Meguru: It's hard to say, but... I'll make sure not to waste Nene-senpai's lessons! Nene: I'm hoping for some good results, Inaba-san. Meguru: Y-Yeah... I'll do my best. Shuuji: Anyway, we shouldn't stand around here chatting forever, so... Tsumugi: Right. See you all on Monday, then. Meguru: Thank you for today, Nene-senpai. Touko: Thanks for having us. Shuuji: Have a nice weekend, Ayachi-san. Nene: Thank you. You too. Touko: I need to take the train, so I'm heading this way. Bye-bye. Meguru: See you. Tsumugi: Thanks for all the help today. Touko: Let's try our best to pass our tests too! Until next week. Shuuji: Yeah, see you at school. Enjoy the rest of your weekend. Shuuji: Alright, you both live in the same direction, right? I've already come this far, so I may as well see you two home. Meguru: You don't have to. My place is just around the corner, and Tsumugi-senpai is with me too. We'll be just fine. Tsumugi: Yeah. I'm happy you want to see us home, but don't you live in the other direction? You've already gone out your way for us enough. There's no need to go even more out of the way. Meguru: Okay, so we'll go the rest of the way alone. Bye! Today was a lot of fun. Tsumugi: It really was. Have a nice weekend. Bye-bye. Shuuji: You too. See you two on Monday. Shuuji: ...Welp, time for me to go home as well. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Man, I really am acting strange. I've never really cared about a school event before. Wakana: ...Oh, Hoshina? Shuuji: Kariya? What are you doing here? Wakana: I'm going home from guitar practice. Shuuji: Out practicing this close to midterms, huh? Wakana: Well, you know, I just needed a change of pace. Hahaha... *sigh* Wakana: As if! I'm not brave enough for that. I'm renting a rehearsal studio. Shuuji: Can you do that by yourself? I always figured that was something only bands could do. Wakana: Rehearsal studios come in all shapes and forms. A lot of places rent out small studios for solo practice. That's the kind I'm renting. Wakana: I've got some cash to play around with thanks to my job at the cafe, so sometimes I rent out a rehearsal studio where I can go all out with an amp. Shuuji: You don't do street performance? Wakana: Oh, please. I'm really not brave enough for that. And it seems like it'd be a real pain in the butt. Shuuji: Then how about forming a band? Wakana: I'm just a hobbyist. I mean, sure, I'm getting some decent practice in now that I bought my own guitar, but still. Shuuji: You've been at this for a while, though. It's been a few years, right? Wakana: Well, yeah. It has. Shuuji: Hmm... Shuuji: How about testing the waters a little? Wakana: Huh? What are you talking about? Shuuji: Want to try showing off your guitar skills in front of some fellow students? Wakana: Some fellow students...? What do you mean by that? What're you talking about? "

She would probably beg me for the honor and would hate me if I didn't ask her. Nene: Okay... Can you take care of that for us, then? Touko: Yup! You bet! Touko: My, this party is starting to sound so fun. Meguru: You said it! Let's make this the best party ever! Touko: Yeah! Nene: Well then, Inaba-san, we better get back to studying so you can actually attend that party. Meguru: Ugh... I'd rather not be reminded... Nene: We were quite productive today, I'd say. Touko: Yeah, we sure were. That was a great study session! Meguru: My head hurts a little from all the concentrating. Nene: Today would be all for naught if you end up forgetting everything. Make sure you review everything if you want it to stick. Meguru: Ugh... I know. Tsumugi: Ayachi-san, thanks for letting us use your apartment. Nene: Don't thank me. I really enjoyed studying together with everyone. Tsumugi: Yeah, I had a ton of fun too! Shuuji: Thanks for helping me study today. Nene: You're very welcome. Usually it's always you helping me out. Touko: Well, Inaba-san, think you can pass your tests now? Meguru: It's hard to say, but... I'll make sure not to waste Nene-senpai's lessons! Nene: I'm hoping for some good results, Inaba-san. Meguru: Y-Yeah... I'll do my best. Shuuji: Anyway, we shouldn't stand around here chatting forever, so... Tsumugi: Right. See you all on Monday, then. Meguru: Thank you for today, Nene-senpai. Touko: Thanks for having us. Shuuji: Have a nice weekend, Ayachi-san. Nene: Thank you. You too. Touko: I need to take the train, so I'm heading this way. Bye-bye. Meguru: See you. Tsumugi: Thanks for all the help today. Touko: Let's try our best to pass our tests too! Until next week. Shuuji: Yeah, see you at school. Enjoy the rest of your weekend. Shuuji: Alright, you both live in the same direction, right? I've already come this far, so I may as well see you two home. Meguru: You don't have to. My place is just around the corner, and Tsumugi-senpai is with me too. We'll be just fine. Tsumugi: Yeah. I'm happy you want to see us home, but don't you live in the other direction? You've already gone out your way for us enough. There's no need to go even more out of the way. Meguru: Okay, so we'll go the rest of the way alone. Bye! Today was a lot of fun. Tsumugi: It really was. Have a nice weekend. Bye-bye. Shuuji: You too. See you two on Monday. Shuuji: ...Welp, time for me to go home as well. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Man, I really am acting strange. I've never really cared about a school event before. Wakana: ...Oh, Hoshina? Shuuji: Kariya? What are you doing here? Wakana: I'm going home from guitar practice. Shuuji: Out practicing this close to midterms, huh? Wakana: Well, you know, I just needed a change of pace. Hahaha... *sigh* Wakana: As if! I'm not brave enough for that. I'm renting a rehearsal studio. Shuuji: Can you do that by yourself? I always figured that was something only bands could do. Wakana: Rehearsal studios come in all shapes and forms. A lot of places rent out small studios for solo practice. That's the kind I'm renting. Wakana: I've got some cash to play around with thanks to my job at the cafe, so sometimes I rent out a rehearsal studio where I can go all out with an amp. Shuuji: You don't do street performance? Wakana: Oh, please. I'm really not brave enough for that. And it seems like it'd be a real pain in the butt. Shuuji: Then how about forming a band? Wakana: I'm just a hobbyist. I mean, sure, I'm getting some decent practice in now that I bought my own guitar, but still. Shuuji: You've been at this for a while, though. It's been a few years, right? Wakana: Well, yeah. It has. Shuuji: Hmm... Shuuji: How about testing the waters a little? Wakana: Huh? What are you talking about? Shuuji: Want to try showing off your guitar skills in front of some fellow students? Wakana: Some fellow students...? What do you mean by that? What're you talking about? \n\nWhile these examples may provide some guidance, evaluate their relevance to the current conversation.

I know you can do it, Ayachi-san! Nene: Thank you for the compliment, but I really can't. I'm not good at being in front of crowds. Schoolgirl D: *sigh* Okay, I guess there's no changing your mind. Aww man, we could've hit it big... Schoolgirl D: Oh! But if you ever change your mind and wanna step onto the stage again, talk to me first! You gotta! Nene: *sigh* Very well.

Touko: Now, now, this just shows how wonderfully your band played, doesn't it? Nene: Yes, and that's an honor, and I'm truly grateful, but... it's rather draining...

Nene-senpai's looking pretty rough. Tsumugi: They'll be closing the club building soon, so I doubt anyone else is gonna come to us with their problems. Shuuji: There you have it, Ayachi-san. Let's call it a day so you can take it easy. Nene: ...Very well. Thank you for looking out for me. Touko: Helping people is important, but you're not going to be able to help anyone if you get sick.

Touko: Oh my, what do you mean? I only made a simple observation. Shuuji: You know what you said, and you clearly did it on purpose. Touko: Mufufu. You're blushing, you know? Shuuji: I'm not used to stuff like this... Go easy on me, please. Touko: Okay, my bad. Well, it's getting late, so how about we start locking up? Shuuji: Yeah, let's. Shuuji: But, before that... Could I have a moment? Touko: Of course. There's no rush. Oh, have you decided to talk to me at last? Shuuji: It's more of a request, I guess? Touko: You need something from me? Touko: Oh, is this about your reward? Decided what you wanted, have you? Go on then, let's hear it. Touko: Please, be honest with me. How can I be of service? Shuuji: I'd just like to talk for a minute if you don't mind. Touko: You want to talk? But isn't that what we're doing right now? Or do you mean you want to talk about sex? Like pillow talk? Oh my, you naughty boy. Shuuji: Could you please cut it out with the dirty jokes? Shuuji: I don't want any kind of special conversation. Certainly not one about sex. I just want us to talk normally so I can learn more about you. Shuuji: I mean, yes, there is a reason I want to talk to you, but we don't have to talk about anything specific... A normal conversation will do just fine, really. Touko: You're really serious about this. My bad. I just went and poked fun at you like normal. Shuuji: No, it's fine. I mean, I know this is a bit out of the blue. Touko: What's this about, though? Why do you want to know more about me? Shuuji: Well, you see, errm... There's no big reason behind it. Shuuji: It's just, we're in the same club, but I barely know anything about you. When I realized that, it started to bother me and made me want to do something about it. Touko: Oh, I see. Shuuji: So I just thought we could hang out together a little, or something. Shuuji: So... is that a no, then? Touko: Chatting itself isn't a problem. I don't mind doing that. Shuuji: Oh, well, that's good... Touko: Well, chatting a little isn't much of a reward, is it? It's just a normal, everyday thing. Touko: So it doesn't feel right. Hmm... Oh, I know. Let's go somewhere on our next day off, just the two of us, and talk there. Shuuji: Huh? Just the two of us? Touko: Yeah, that's right. That'll make it nice and easy for us to talk, won't it? Shuuji: D-Do you mean like... Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Yeah, sounds great. Touko: It's settled, then! Your reward for doing a good job with the Halloween party is a date with me. I sound a bit arrogant, putting it that way. Ahaha. Shuuji: N-No, I don't think you did at all. Thank you very much, Senpai. Touko: No problem. Well then, I'm looking forward to our date. Shuuji: I-I'm looking forward to it too. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: A date with Togakushi-senpai... Shuuji: A date... A date, huh? Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Do I even have any good date clothes?! Hideaki: Yo! Shuuji: Hey. Hideaki: What're you doing here so early? Shuuji: Just thinking about things. Hideaki: If something's bothering you, why not go talk to your friends at the OC?

I mean, the drum thing worked out, didn't it? Shuuji: That's true. Shuuji: You're being awfully nice today. Hideaki: That's 'cause it looks like something's really bothering you. And now I wanna know what it is. Shuuji: You're really enjoying this, huh? Hideaki: Kinda? But I'm pretty worried too. I'm not gonna laugh at you, I swear. I'll just give you my opinion. Shuuji: The whole reason I'm hesitant is that I know you'll laugh at me. Hideaki: A date, huh? I see, hmm... Hideaki: ...... Hideaki: Pfft, ahahahaha! Even middle schoolers don't worry about that nowadays! Ahahahaha! Shuuji: I thought you weren't gonna laugh! Hideaki: Sorry, my bad. Couldn't help it. Just didn't expect you to be worrying about a date. Shuuji: I think a lot of people worry about dates, actually. Hideaki: I went out and bought new clothes and everything for it. But I was wearing stuff I wasn't used to, so it went horribly. Shuuji: So, do you think I should dress up properly for a date? Hideaki: I dunno. Like, obviously you have to pay attention to your looks, but... I don't think you need to dress fancy or anything. Hideaki: Especially in your case, Shuuji. It's not like you're going on an actual date, right? So the rules for a normal date don't apply. Shuuji: Yeah... You're right. "

But I was wearing stuff I wasn't used to, so it went horribly. Shuuji: So, do you think I should dress up properly for a date? Hideaki: I dunno. Like, obviously you have to pay attention to your looks, but... I don't think you need to dress fancy or anything. Hideaki: Especially in your case, Shuuji. It's not like you're going on an actual date, right? So the rules for a normal date don't apply. Shuuji: Yeah... You're right. \n\nWhile these examples may provide some guidance, evaluate their relevance to the current conversation.

Nene: Sorry, but I'm not interested. I was just a stand-in for that one occasion. Schoolgirl D: But didn't the crowd's reaction feel great? Don't you wanna get more of that, on an even bigger stage? I know you can do it, Ayachi-san! Nene: Thank you for the compliment, but I really can't. I'm not good at being in front of crowds. Schoolgirl D: *sigh* Okay, I guess there's no changing your mind. Aww man, we could've hit it big... Schoolgirl D: Oh! But if you ever change your mind and wanna step onto the stage again, talk to me first! You gotta! Nene: *sigh* Very well. Touko: You had it tough today. Here's some tea. Drink it and let it calm your soul. Watch out, though; it's hot. Nene: Thank you, Togakushi-senpai. Nene: *blow* *sip* Ahh, wonderful... Tsumugi: And there were even more people who asked her in our classroom. Meguru: Really? Whoa, that's crazy... Nene: I'm glad that they liked my singing... I just wish they would leave me be. Touko: Now, now, this just shows how wonderfully your band played, doesn't it? Nene: Yes, and that's an honor, and I'm truly grateful, but... it's rather draining... Shuuji: In fact, I'm sure it'll be a lot calmer tomorrow, even. The party is still fresh in everyone's minds. Nene: I hope you're right... Meguru: Should we wrap things up here, then? Nene-senpai's looking pretty rough. Tsumugi: They'll be closing the club building soon, so I doubt anyone else is gonna come to us with their problems. Shuuji: There you have it, Ayachi-san. Let's call it a day so you can take it easy. Nene: ...Very well. Thank you for looking out for me. Touko: Helping people is important, but you're not going to be able to help anyone if you get sick. Touko: I'll take over tidying and locking up, so you can go straight home. Nene: ...Are you sure? Touko: Yup, just leave it to me! Nene: Well then, I'll be excusing myself. Thank you, everyone. Touko: Bye-bye～ Make sure you get some rest! Tsumugi: Wait up! I'll go home with you, just in case. Meguru: Oh, I'll come too. What about you, Senpai? Shuuji: I feel bad making Togakushi-senpai tidy up by herself, so I'll stay and help her out. Tsumugi: Bye, then. Shuuji: Yeah, see you later. Touko: See you tomorrow～ Shuuji: ...... Touko: Oh my, what do you mean? I only made a simple observation. Shuuji: You know what you said, and you clearly did it on purpose. Touko: Mufufu. You're blushing, you know? Shuuji: I'm not used to stuff like this... Go easy on me, please. Touko: Okay, my bad. Well, it's getting late, so how about we start locking up? Shuuji: Yeah, let's. Shuuji: But, before that... Could I have a moment? Touko: Of course. There's no rush. Oh, have you decided to talk to me at last? Shuuji: It's more of a request, I guess? Touko: You need something from me? Touko: Oh, is this about your reward? Decided what you wanted, have you? Go on then, let's hear it. Touko: Please, be honest with me. How can I be of service? Shuuji: I'd just like to talk for a minute if you don't mind. Touko: You want to talk? But isn't that what we're doing right now? Or do you mean you want to talk about sex? Like pillow talk? Oh my, you naughty boy. Shuuji: Could you please cut it out with the dirty jokes? Shuuji: I don't want any kind of special conversation. Certainly not one about sex. I just want us to talk normally so I can learn more about you. Shuuji: I mean, yes, there is a reason I want to talk to you, but we don't have to talk about anything specific... A normal conversation will do just fine, really. Touko: You're really serious about this. My bad. I just went and poked fun at you like normal. Shuuji: No, it's fine. I mean, I know this is a bit out of the blue. Touko: What's this about, though? Why do you want to know more about me? Shuuji: Well, you see, errm... There's no big reason behind it. Shuuji: It's just, we're in the same club, but I barely know anything about you. When I realized that, it started to bother me and made me want to do something about it. Touko: Oh, I see. Shuuji: So I just thought we could hang out together a little, or something. Shuuji: So... is that a no, then? Touko: Chatting itself isn't a problem. I don't mind doing that. Shuuji: Oh, well, that's good... Touko: Well, chatting a little isn't much of a reward, is it? It's just a normal, everyday thing. Touko: So it doesn't feel right. Hmm... Oh, I know. Let's go somewhere on our next day off, just the two of us, and talk there. Shuuji: Huh? Just the two of us? Touko: Yeah, that's right. That'll make it nice and easy for us to talk, won't it? Shuuji: D-Do you mean like... Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Yeah, sounds great. Touko: It's settled, then! Your reward for doing a good job with the Halloween party is a date with me. I sound a bit arrogant, putting it that way. Ahaha. Shuuji: N-No, I don't think you did at all. Thank you very much, Senpai. Touko: No problem. Well then, I'm looking forward to our date. Shuuji: I-I'm looking forward to it too. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: A date with Togakushi-senpai... Shuuji: A date... A date, huh? Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Do I even have any good date clothes?! Hideaki: Yo! Shuuji: Hey. Hideaki: What're you doing here so early? Shuuji: Just thinking about things. Hideaki: If something's bothering you, why not go talk to your friends at the OC? Shuuji: If it was a normal problem, I would. Shuuji: But this is a matter of pride. I can't talk to girls about this. Hideaki: Oho. This sounds interesting―no, I dare say fascinating. Hideaki: Well, we're both men here. You can talk to me about it! Shuuji: Huh? With you? Kaidou...? Hideaki: What's with that reaction? Don't talk smack until you try! I mean, the drum thing worked out, didn't it? Shuuji: That's true. Shuuji: You're being awfully nice today. Hideaki: That's 'cause it looks like something's really bothering you. And now I wanna know what it is. Shuuji: You're really enjoying this, huh? Hideaki: Kinda? But I'm pretty worried too. I'm not gonna laugh at you, I swear. I'll just give you my opinion. Shuuji: The whole reason I'm hesitant is that I know you'll laugh at me. Hideaki: A date, huh? I see, hmm... Hideaki: ...... Hideaki: Pfft, ahahahaha! Even middle schoolers don't worry about that nowadays! Ahahahaha! Shuuji: I thought you weren't gonna laugh! Hideaki: Sorry, my bad. Couldn't help it.

Meguru: (Is there something going on between them? This is kinda frustrating...) Touko: Okay, I have plans to see a friend now. See you all tomorrow. Tsumugi: Yeah, bye. Tsumugi: How about we all go somewhere too? Or maybe it would be better to go straight home today, huh? Nene: Yes... I would appreciate that. Tsumugi: That's fine! Get plenty of rest. Meguru: ......

Meguru: Oh, our hands... Shuuji: You're just now realizing that? Meguru: Y-Yeah. I just kinda grabbed your hand without thinking. Sorry! Shuuji: It's not like I mind... Shuuji: Umm... So what do you want to talk about? Meguru: Oh, r-right! About that, umm... Shuuji: What? Meguru: I mean y-you're unfair! Meguru: I wanna get along with Nene-senpai too! Shuuji: ...What? Meguru: It feels like you been talking to each other behind everyone's backs! Meguru: You've been talking with THE Nene-senpai! She's cute, pretty, has a great figure, is classy but nice... but she still keeps everyone at a distance. Everyone but you, it seems! Meguru: That's so not fair! Meguru: N-No, I wouldn't go that far. I'd feel bad asking about that... Shuuji: Yeah? Meguru: Senpai, how have you gotten so close with Nene-senpai? Shuuji: Right, umm... Shuuji: Hmm... If you wanna be better friends with her, shouldn't you have gone home with her instead of dragging me off somewhere? Meguru: W-Well yeah, I guess, but... Shuuji: Though, if it were that easy, we wouldn't be here right now. Meguru: Y-Yeah! Right! Shuuji: But you know, the way I see it is that you're the one who's closer to Ayachi-san. Shuuji: It's not like I can hug Ayachi-san like you do. Meguru: Well, no duh! Guys can't just hug girls out of nowhere! That'd be so wrong! Shuuji: Can't exactly say no to that. Ayachi-san is pretty hot... Meguru: Ugh... You're such a creeper sometimes. Seriously, how can you say that? Shuuji: You're the one who asked me that! Any guy would feel the same way. It's not like we act on every urge we get! Meguru: Looking at it the other way around, all I can do is hug her and nothing else. Shuuji: What do you mean by that? Meguru: W-Well, you know... We never chat alone in the clubroom during lunch break, for example. Shuuji: So that really has been weighing on your mind... We didn't talk about anything special there, okay? Meguru: Th-That doesn't make it any less unfair. I'm still just as jealous knowing that! Meguru: Remember what I said yesterday? I just want all of my friendships to be deep. That's why! Shuuji: Hmm... Meguru: But like I just mentioned, Nene-senpai always seems kinda distant, you know? So it's hard to just up and ask her. Meguru: What if she went all, \"You want me to eat lunch with you? Why would I do that?\" I'd die from shock. Shuuji: ...Yeah, that's tough. Shuuji: Okay. I'll do what I can. Meguru: ...!! Shuuji: Err, I think it's a bit early to be thanking me. Meguru: Whatcha mean? Shuuji: While I'd love to help you, I'm not actually sure how I got so close to Ayachi-san. Shuuji: So I don't have a clue where to start. Meguru: What?! Meguru: Th-That's not true! You're like super close! You've even been communicating with eye contact alone! Meguru: That's the whole reason I said this is unfair! Shuuji: Well, I'm glad you think so, but I dunno what to do... Shuuji: Like you said earlier, there's an inherent difference in how we can interact with her since I'm a guy and you're a girl. I doubt my approach would work for you. Meguru: You got close with her in a way only a guy can...? Meguru: W-Wait! Is that why you understand each other so well?! I mean, like, your relationship has gotten ph-ph-physical?! Shuuji: Whoa, whoa! Hold on! You're way off-base! Why are you taking things in that direction?! Meguru: Don't put this on me! You're the one who made it sound like that! Shuuji: I didn't! That was all you! Anyway, just calm down. Let's get some drinks at the vending machine over there. Shuuji: That's what I want to say... *sip* Anyway, that was just a misunderstanding on your part.  Meguru: Yeah, I know. There's no way that'd be true now that I think about it. Shuuji: Would've been nice if you thought that through sooner... Would have saved me some money on the drinks. Meguru: Ah, speaking of, is the milk tea you got any good? I had a hard time deciding between that and this coffee. Shuuji: I'd say it's better than the kind they have at school. Meguru: Hmm... Maybe I should've went with the milk tea instead. Shuuji: Want a taste? Meguru: Of course not! That would be an... i-i-indirect kiss! Shuuji: Oh... Y-Yeah, I guess so. Meguru: Geez, why are you always like this? There's no way a dolt like you could get close with Nene-senpai! Shuuji: Isn't that different from what you said earlier? Meguru: ...So please tell me how you got so close to her while being such a dolt. Shuuji: Err, like I said, I have no idea. Meguru: You are no help at all... Shuuji: Oh, give me a break. Let me think... Meguru: I won't drink that even if you wipe the rim clean. Shuuji: Forget about that already. What I'm saying is... Shuuji: Why not just go and visit Ayachi-san right now? Meguru: ...... Shuuji: And then when you're there, suggest staying the night. Meguru: ...Y-You mean, just me? Shuuji: Of course. You want to get closer to her, right? Meguru: N-No way! Shuuji: You mean you don't want to get closer to her?! Meguru: No, I do! But you want me to stay the night with her?! Meguru: Visiting her by myself would be hard enough for me... Shuuji: And yet you have no qualms hanging out at my place... Meguru: Th-That's because it's you. Meguru: R-Right. Meguru: But, umm, the idea itself is good. Sleeping over at Nene-senpai's place is like a dream for me. Shuuji: Okay, then with that goal in mind, how about you work towards getting closer to her starting tomorrow? Meguru: Ugh... Can I really do this? Shuuji: Well, how about you come and stay over at my place as practice? Meguru: AS IF!! Shuuji: Well, with that settled, let's pick this back up tomorrow. Meguru: O-Okay. See you tomorrow. Meguru: Umm... Thank you, Senpai. Shuuji: You can show your thanks by staying the night at my place. Meguru: What?! Are you serious?! Are you in super-perv Senpai mode right now?! Are you after me or something?! Shuuji: Nah, just kidding. Meguru: You've got a real messed up sense of humor... Taichi: Okay. Take care. Shuuji: ...Good morning. Meguru: Yeah! I figured you'd eventually pass by here. Shuuji: ...Why, though? Meguru: Hey! What kind of reaction is that? Meguru: Didn't you tell me you'd help me yesterday? Shuuji: Oh yeah, I guess that makes sense... Shuuji: Sorry. I was just a little taken aback. Meguru: ...Senpai? Shuuji: Oh, it's nothing. Let's walk while we talk. Meguru: Yeah! Roger that. Shuuji: We'll end up at school in no time if we follow my regular route though. Shuuji: So at the risk of sounding boring, let's take the same detour as yesterday. Shuuji: Should we not have taken a detour? Meguru: No, that was actually a good idea. Meguru: ...It just feels strange heading to school with you. Shuuji: Even though you were waiting to ambush me... Meguru: I-I know. And did you have to put it like that? You make me sound like a bad guy! Shuuji: Anyway, if you have no problem with the detour, then let's get down to business. Shuuji: We need to talk about how you should get closer to Ayachi-san. Meguru: Y-Yeah. Shuuji: So, to make sure, is the goal still being able to sleep over at her place? Meguru: Yeah, we can go with that. Meguru: I kinda got really flustered yesterday, but after thinking about it calmly, it doesn't seem too hard to do. Shuuji: If it's that easy, then can't you do this without my help? Meguru: Th-That's not how I meant it! You can't back out now! You already promised me you'd help! Meguru: Good! Meguru: You know, for how cold you seem, you're surprisingly nice. Shuuji: How am I supposed to take that? Meguru: As a compliment. Shuuji: O-Okay, thanks... Anyhow... Shuuji: The way I see it, getting used to interacting with her is the only way. Meguru: Right. I agree with that. Shuuji: And so, your first step should be― Meguru: Ne... N-N-Nene-senpai! Meguru: Good mornifsh! Nene: It's unusual to see you here in the morning. Meguru: Y-Yesh. Tru dat! Nene: ......?? Meguru: Not at all! Just saying good morninf! Meguru: Hoshina-senpai invited me, so I figured I would swing by... Nene: Okay...? Meguru: Helloha! Nene: ...Yes. Helloha to you as well. Meguru: ...... Nene: ...... "

It was just you all day long... Shuuji: No use crying about that. Ayachi-san was busy all day dealing with everyone stopping by. Meguru: Nene-senpai, do you think we could just get one quest in together? Nene: I'm sorry, but I really don't feel like playing games after all that... Nene: Besides... Nene: I-It's just you. Right, Hoshina-kun? Shuuji: Yeah, don't be silly. C'mon, you'll get left behind if you don't hurry up. Meguru: ...Hey, don't just gloss over my question like that. Shuuji: We're not glossing over anything. Anyway, where's my bag? Meguru: ...... Meguru: (Is there something going on between them? This is kinda frustrating...) Touko: Okay, I have plans to see a friend now. See you all tomorrow. Tsumugi: Yeah, bye. Tsumugi: How about we all go somewhere too? Or maybe it would be better to go straight home today, huh? Nene: Yes... I would appreciate that. Tsumugi: That's fine! Get plenty of rest. Meguru: ...... Shuuji: Hm? Inaba-san, what's wrong? You don't wanna go home? Meguru: ...Senpai. Meguru: Come with me for a bit! Shuuji: Wha?! Nene: Ah, okay... Meguru: I need to talk to you! Meguru: Oh, our hands... Shuuji: You're just now realizing that? Meguru: Y-Yeah. I just kinda grabbed your hand without thinking. Sorry! Shuuji: It's not like I mind... Shuuji: Umm... So what do you want to talk about? Meguru: Oh, r-right! About that, umm... Shuuji: What? Meguru: I mean y-you're unfair! Meguru: I wanna get along with Nene-senpai too! Shuuji: ...What? Meguru: It feels like you been talking to each other behind everyone's backs! Meguru: You've been talking with THE Nene-senpai! She's cute, pretty, has a great figure, is classy but nice... but she still keeps everyone at a distance. Everyone but you, it seems! Meguru: That's so not fair! Meguru: N-No, I wouldn't go that far. I'd feel bad asking about that... Shuuji: Yeah? Meguru: Senpai, how have you gotten so close with Nene-senpai? Shuuji: Right, umm... Shuuji: Hmm... If you wanna be better friends with her, shouldn't you have gone home with her instead of dragging me off somewhere? Meguru: W-Well yeah, I guess, but... Shuuji: Though, if it were that easy, we wouldn't be here right now. Meguru: Y-Yeah! Right! Shuuji: But you know, the way I see it is that you're the one who's closer to Ayachi-san. Shuuji: It's not like I can hug Ayachi-san like you do. Meguru: Well, no duh! Guys can't just hug girls out of nowhere! That'd be so wrong! Shuuji: Can't exactly say no to that. Ayachi-san is pretty hot... Meguru: Ugh... You're such a creeper sometimes. Seriously, how can you say that? Shuuji: You're the one who asked me that! Any guy would feel the same way. It's not like we act on every urge we get! Meguru: Looking at it the other way around, all I can do is hug her and nothing else. Shuuji: What do you mean by that? Meguru: W-Well, you know... We never chat alone in the clubroom during lunch break, for example. Shuuji: So that really has been weighing on your mind... We didn't talk about anything special there, okay? Meguru: Th-That doesn't make it any less unfair. I'm still just as jealous knowing that! Meguru: Remember what I said yesterday? I just want all of my friendships to be deep. That's why! Shuuji: Hmm... Meguru: But like I just mentioned, Nene-senpai always seems kinda distant, you know? So it's hard to just up and ask her. Meguru: What if she went all, \"You want me to eat lunch with you? Why would I do that?\" I'd die from shock. Shuuji: ...Yeah, that's tough. Shuuji: Okay. I'll do what I can. Meguru: ...!! Shuuji: Err, I think it's a bit early to be thanking me. Meguru: Whatcha mean? Shuuji: While I'd love to help you, I'm not actually sure how I got so close to Ayachi-san. Shuuji: So I don't have a clue where to start. Meguru: What?! Meguru: Th-That's not true! You're like super close! You've even been communicating with eye contact alone! Meguru: That's the whole reason I said this is unfair! Shuuji: Well, I'm glad you think so, but I dunno what to do... Shuuji: Like you said earlier, there's an inherent difference in how we can interact with her since I'm a guy and you're a girl. I doubt my approach would work for you. Meguru: You got close with her in a way only a guy can...? Meguru: W-Wait! Is that why you understand each other so well?! I mean, like, your relationship has gotten ph-ph-physical?! Shuuji: Whoa, whoa! Hold on! You're way off-base! Why are you taking things in that direction?! Meguru: Don't put this on me! You're the one who made it sound like that! Shuuji: I didn't! That was all you! Anyway, just calm down. Let's get some drinks at the vending machine over there. Shuuji: That's what I want to say... *sip* Anyway, that was just a misunderstanding on your part.  Meguru: Yeah, I know. There's no way that'd be true now that I think about it. Shuuji: Would've been nice if you thought that through sooner... Would have saved me some money on the drinks. Meguru: Ah, speaking of, is the milk tea you got any good? I had a hard time deciding between that and this coffee. Shuuji: I'd say it's better than the kind they have at school. Meguru: Hmm... Maybe I should've went with the milk tea instead. Shuuji: Want a taste? Meguru: Of course not! That would be an... i-i-indirect kiss! Shuuji: Oh... Y-Yeah, I guess so. Meguru: Geez, why are you always like this? There's no way a dolt like you could get close with Nene-senpai! Shuuji: Isn't that different from what you said earlier? Meguru: ...So please tell me how you got so close to her while being such a dolt. Shuuji: Err, like I said, I have no idea. Meguru: You are no help at all... Shuuji: Oh, give me a break. Let me think... Meguru: I won't drink that even if you wipe the rim clean. Shuuji: Forget about that already. What I'm saying is... Shuuji: Why not just go and visit Ayachi-san right now? Meguru: ...... Shuuji: And then when you're there, suggest staying the night. Meguru: ...Y-You mean, just me? Shuuji: Of course. You want to get closer to her, right? Meguru: N-No way! Shuuji: You mean you don't want to get closer to her?! Meguru: No, I do! But you want me to stay the night with her?! Meguru: Visiting her by myself would be hard enough for me... Shuuji: And yet you have no qualms hanging out at my place... Meguru: Th-That's because it's you. Meguru: R-Right. Meguru: But, umm, the idea itself is good. Sleeping over at Nene-senpai's place is like a dream for me. Shuuji: Okay, then with that goal in mind, how about you work towards getting closer to her starting tomorrow? Meguru: Ugh... Can I really do this? Shuuji: Well, how about you come and stay over at my place as practice? Meguru: AS IF!! Shuuji: Well, with that settled, let's pick this back up tomorrow. Meguru: O-Okay. See you tomorrow. Meguru: Umm... Thank you, Senpai. Shuuji: You can show your thanks by staying the night at my place. Meguru: What?! Are you serious?! Are you in super-perv Senpai mode right now?! Are you after me or something?! Shuuji: Nah, just kidding. Meguru: You've got a real messed up sense of humor... Taichi: Okay. Take care. Shuuji: ...Good morning. Meguru: Yeah! I figured you'd eventually pass by here. Shuuji: ...Why, though? Meguru: Hey! What kind of reaction is that? Meguru: Didn't you tell me you'd help me yesterday? Shuuji: Oh yeah, I guess that makes sense... Shuuji: Sorry. I was just a little taken aback. Meguru: ...Senpai? Shuuji: Oh, it's nothing. Let's walk while we talk. Meguru: Yeah! Roger that. Shuuji: We'll end up at school in no time if we follow my regular route though. Shuuji: So at the risk of sounding boring, let's take the same detour as yesterday.

I imagine you must be pretty exhausted.  Nene: Thank you, Togakushi-senpai. Touko: The only thing at home I can do is study, and doing that all day just turns my brain to mush. I'm sure you know that feeling.  Touko: So, if you guys don't mind, would it be alright if I stayed and helped the OC out?  Tsumugi: Only if you count the clubroom. If you count all the people that asked her in the classroom during school, it's way more than three.  Nene: It has been quite the day... Shuuji: ...Definitely. I can tell that just by looking at you. Touko: Well, it'll all die down soon. We just have to wait for word to spread that Ayachi-san won't keep singing.

Now I have to worry about that actually happening.  Touko: Oh, I'm sorry. But still, being prepared for it ahead of time isn't such a bad idea.  Nene: D-Don't worry, I have an excuse. I'll just tell them that the Occult Club is going to be doing a performance.  Shuuji: Let's hope that's enough to dissuade them.  Tsumugi: No need to worry about it now, you have time. A lot of things can change in a year, so you might as well just worry about it when the time comes.  Shuuji: True. We can't really make predictions about events that far off in the future.  Nene: Still... Just thinking about the possibility is enough to make me depressed... *sigh* Touko: How long do you guys usually stay?  Nene: It can vary depending on things, but generally, I would say we leave around six.  Shuuji: Do you wanna just call it a day now? We can do that. I know several of the sports teams end around this time too.  Touko: Good idea. I imagine Ayachi-san wants to go on home and lay down.

Why didn't you come up and say something sooner... Shuuji: Sorry, I was just a little confused, so I wound up staring. Are you out grocery shopping too? Nene: No, not quite.

Shuuji: ...Ramen? Nene: I told you not to look... Shuuji: S-Sorry. But really, I don't see anything to be embarrassed about.  Nene: You really don't think it's... strange or anything? You can't tell me a girl eating at a ramen restaurant all by herself doesn't weird you out.  Shuuji: Oh no, not at all. I don't see anything wrong with it. Nene: O-Oh, well thank you. Nene: It's not something I love, per se... but I've been curious to explore it.  Nene: Do you remember that day when you and I went with Inaba-san to the conveyor-belt sushi restaurant? Shuuji: Yeah, I do.  Nene: Well, it's much the same scenario... I've never actually been to a ramen restaurant before.  Shuuji: Is that so? Shuuji: You're getting cold feet?  Nene: That's right... I looked in and only saw men dining there, so I got scared.  Nene: But the thing is, I'm not sure I'll ever work up the courage to do this again if I walk away... Shuuji: Is trying this ramen that important to you?  Nene: ...Yes. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Umm... would you like me to come with you? Maybe that would help. Nene: Ah, er, wait... I thought you were going to be eating dinner at home.  Shuuji: Nah, it's all good. None of it'll get cold. Shuuji: And all this talk of ramen's gotten me a little curious... You wouldn't mind if I joined you, would you?  Shuuji: Absolutely. Ready to go on in? Nene: Yes! Shuuji: Coming.  Nene: Ramen! Oh, Ramen! Nene: It'll be my first time having real ramen instead of the cheap, instant kind. I can't wait to see how it tastes. Nene: Is that some sort of problem, perhaps?  Shuuji: Well, before we go in, let me check with you: are you aware of what kind of place this is?  Nene: Come again? I thought it was a ramen place. Is it not? Really? But I'm sure I― Shuuji: Weeell, you could SAY it's a ramen place, but that's not quite the full picture... Let's just say it's a bit of special place. Nene: Oh, you don't have to worry about that. I've done my research prior to coming here.  Shuuji: Really?  Nene: Yes. I have it all down pat. Shuuji: Yeah, a few times with Kaidou.  Shuuji: Ah, yes. Just us two.  Clerk: We got two free seats together, so come on and follow me.  Shuuji: Are you ready, Ayachi-san? Nene: Yes! Clerk: How's it goin', y'all! Shuuji: What are you getting? Nene: The extra large char siu. Shuuji: The extra large?  Nene: Am I not allowed to?  Shuuji: Well, you are, but it's gonna be a lot of food. You sure you can handle it?  Nene: Absolutely. It might seem surprising, but I'm actually a large eater.  Shuuji: Oh, really?  Shuuji: ...Are you sure about that? Nene: Huh? Clerk: Er, yeah, absolutely, miss... W-We'll have that out to ya.  Shuuji: A-Ayachi-san, what are you DOING?! Nene: What? Is something the matter?  Shuuji: A-Are you sure you want that? Like, are you REALLY sure you want that?  Nene: Well... is that not the special code that you chant when ordering it? I read on the internet that first-timers should simply stick to ordering it that way. Shuuji: Man oh man... You actually believed that... Nene: Now it's only a matter of time before it comes out and I get to eat it! Oh, I wonder what it'll taste like... I'm so excited♪ Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Yeah, we've already ordered and everything.  Nene: I feel a little bad. My apologies. But still, I'm glad our path's crossed.  Shuuji: Y-You are...? Nene: Absolutely. I've been eager to eat at this place for so, so long. Nene: Plus enjoying meals with others is something I seldom get the chance to do. It's always nice to have company.  Shuuji: O-Ohh... yeah. Shuuji: Yeah, I'm all good.  Shuuji: That exciting for you?  Nene: Oh, yes! I've had my eyes on this restaurant for so, sooo long. But I could never bring myself to come, you see. Nene: Just to put my frustration into perspective for you, if I had waited a tad bit longer, it might've been possible to retrieve fragments from me. Shuuji: Eh, I don't know, that sounds like a bit of an exaggeration.  Nene: I guarantee you it's not. I'm genuinely happy.   Nene: But, just so you know... If you don't want to stay here with me, you don't have to. You're free to leave anytime.  Shuuji: I don't mind. And if anything, I enjoy hanging out with you.  Nene: Huh...?! Umm, what did you― Shuuji: A-Ah, uhm! I just meant that, like, when I'm with you I don't have to worry about my secret, so it makes me feel relaxed, I guess? Or comfortable? Something like that.  Nene: Ah, yes, of course. Don't worry, I fully understand what you're trying to say.  Nene: And also, I enjoy hanging out with you too, Hoshina-kun.  Shuuji: ―――! Nene: ...... Nene: A-Also, I think I ought to thank you. You've really helped me out in a variety of ways.  Shuuji: Oh, no, I'm not looking for thanks. Really, I should be the one apologizing, considering you still haven't gotten back all your fragments.  Nene: No, that's perfectly alright. They are coming back, slowly but surely.  Nene: Ah! It's finally here♪ I finally get to taste real ramen♪ Shuuji: ...... Nene: Umm... What is this?  Shuuji: An extra large char siu ramen with noodles firm and spicy, extra veggies, and extra extra garlic oil. Nene: But, the thing is, I don't see the noodles. Where are they? Shuuji: Beneath that mountain of vegetables somewhere. Nene: ...This isn't ramen like I know it.  Shuuji: Well, this isn't regular ramen. It's the \"Taroumaru\" style of ramen.  Nene: Ramen... Nene: Ah, goodness! I can't mope around like this; That would be a definite breach of the sacred ramen etiquette! I have to start eating.  Shuuji: What?! Sacred ramen etiquette?! Nene: No. I was the one who ordered it, so I'll eat all of it. Well then, without further ado.  Shuuji: Well, at first, yeah. Oh, and you ate the vegetables. That's not part of the ramen.  Shuuji: True.  Shuuji: %130;HOW IN―?! Guest A: Yer frickin' kidding... That lass ate everything, even the soup... Guest B: And she's as slim as a twig?! Guest C: But boy is she a looker... Help, boys, I'm fallin' in love! Nene: D-Do you need something? You're staring at me, and it's making me rather embarrassed.  Nene: Is there something on my face, perhaps?  Shuuji: No, not that. I was just wondering, like... how does that slim body of yours even hold all that food... Guest A: Who IS that girl, seriously?! Guest B: Man, I don't even think I'd be able to eat all that.  Guest C: ...I wanna have an eating contest with her! Nene: ......? The other customers seem to be talking amongst themselves about something. Do you know why?  Shuuji: Probably. They just witnessed the birth of a new legend.  Nene: Huh... A legend, you say...? Nene: That and then some. It was simply delicious. But, ugh... I think I may have overeaten just a little bit.  Shuuji: Just a LITTLE...? Nene: My stomach's so full I might not be able to fit anything else in the rest of the day. It was very worthwhile coming here. Nene: And, of course, I have to thank you for accompanying me.  Shuuji: My pleasure.  Nene: Thanks to you, this won't be nagging at my chest anymore... I feel relieved. Guest B: And she ate so gracefully too... Damn, I'm a jealous man.  Guest C: I wanna challenge her to an eat-off.  Nene: I don't know why... but I feel like we're drawing a lot of attention.  Shuuji: Ah... yeah... Nene: Come on. Shuuji: I-I'm coming... Shuuji: What do you mean?  Nene: Well, so many people were staring at me... So I had the idea that maybe I'd done something disrespectful or rude.  Shuuji: No, you didn't do anything wrong. They were looking at you out of admiration. Nene: But for what reason? All I did was eat a bowl of ramen.  Shuuji: That was no ordinary bowl of ramen, though.  Nene: ......? I'm still somewhat confused, but it's good to know that they at least weren't angry at me, or sneering at me.   Shuuji: Oh, I forgot to ask. How's your stomach? Does it hurt any?  Nene: No, it feels quite fine. The only thing my chest is full of right now is joy and content *siigh*... Nene: What's wrong, Hoshina-kun? Shuuji: Ah, nothing. Glad to hear you liked it; I enjoyed mine too. It was a pretty fun time, all things considered.  Nene: I feel the same. Really, though... It feels like I have fun whatever I'm doing when you're there too.  Shuuji: Wh-Where'd that come from... Could you explain that a little more?  Nene: Well, we have many more members in the club now, and I got to go to the ramen place I've been longing to try. It's just been new experiences day after day... I enjoy my life a lot more.  Shuuji: R-Really? Nene: Yes. That's the honest truth.  Shuuji: Come to think of it, it's the same for me. I've made so many new experiences since joining the club. Hanging out with girls outside of school, participating in a school event, and so on and so forth.  Shuuji: My life would've been a million times duller if I hadn't made the decision to be more social and outgoing.  Nene: Huh? Oh, hardly. I haven't done anything quite that special.  Shuuji: Oh, but you have. Also, not as a repayment or anything, but if you ever feel scared to go someplace alone again... Just ask me, and I'll gladly come with you.  Nene: ...Er, umm... but... Nene: ...... Nene: Can I... hold you to that, then? Shuuji: Of course. Just hit me up whenever.  Nene: Thank you! Haha.  Shuuji: Of course, that's only if you don't mind me tagging along.  Nene: Why would I mind? Remember what I just told you? Every moment is fun when I'm with you.  Shuuji: O-Oh, uh, thanks. Shuuji: I'm in the same boat as you. Ever since I joined the OC, and became friends with you, I've been having so much fun. Nene: ―――! Nene: Th-Thank... you... Nene: Y-Yes. We ended club early today so I could go home and get rested up. It would be disrespectful to the rest of the club members if I stayed out late wandering around town.  Shuuji: Huh? Nene: Look, over there. That has to be her.  Shuuji: Oh, you're right. Shuuji: Yeah, better not disturb them if they're on a date.  Nene: Let's hurry and be on our way before she sees us.  Shuuji: That's the smartest idea, yeah.  Shuuji: Good to hear.  Nene: Make sure you get a good night's rest too, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Sure thing. Well, Ayachi-san, see you at school tomorrow. Goodnight.  Nene: Goodnight.  Nene: ...... Nene: Ack!!

Stop reminiscing and get in your seats. I wanna get homeroom over with quickly.  Hideaki: Yes ma'am.  Kanae: You too, Hoshina.  Shuuji: Ah, sorry.  Nene: I'm sorry... I only participated as a pinch hitter. Schoolgirl D: But you can sing SO good, girl! With you, we could seriously become an international sensation!! Nene: I appreciate your kind words, I do... but I'm really sorry. I have no intention of singing any further. Schoolgirl D: Man, that's a bummer... I was ready to be a star.  Schoolgirl D: But if you ever change your mind, I'm always up for it! I'll wait for you, no matter how long it takes! Nene: U-Uhm, yes... Thank you.  Touko: Here, have some tea. I imagine you must be pretty exhausted.  Nene: Thank you, Togakushi-senpai. Touko: The only thing at home I can do is study, and doing that all day just turns my brain to mush. I'm sure you know that feeling.  Touko: So, if you guys don't mind, would it be alright if I stayed and helped the OC out?  Tsumugi: Only if you count the clubroom. If you count all the people that asked her in the classroom during school, it's way more than three.  Nene: It has been quite the day... Shuuji: ...Definitely. I can tell that just by looking at you. Touko: Well, it'll all die down soon. We just have to wait for word to spread that Ayachi-san won't keep singing.  Meguru: But still, she might get random requests to come fill for people if they lose a vocalist or something. Can't count out that possibility.  Nene: ...I really wouldn't like that. I never even expected to receive this much attention in the first place... It almost makes me wish I hadn't done this.  Touko: And I gotta imagine you'll get another rush of invitations once the cultural festival comes around next year.  Nene: Don't say that, Togakushi-senpai. Now I have to worry about that actually happening.  Touko: Oh, I'm sorry. But still, being prepared for it ahead of time isn't such a bad idea.  Nene: D-Don't worry, I have an excuse. I'll just tell them that the Occult Club is going to be doing a performance.  Shuuji: Let's hope that's enough to dissuade them.  Tsumugi: No need to worry about it now, you have time. A lot of things can change in a year, so you might as well just worry about it when the time comes.  Shuuji: True. We can't really make predictions about events that far off in the future.  Nene: Still... Just thinking about the possibility is enough to make me depressed... *sigh* Touko: How long do you guys usually stay?  Nene: It can vary depending on things, but generally, I would say we leave around six.  Shuuji: Do you wanna just call it a day now? We can do that. I know several of the sports teams end around this time too.  Touko: Good idea. I imagine Ayachi-san wants to go on home and lay down.  Meguru: We don't have to stay if you don't want to, Nene-senpai. Tsumugi: And don't forget, this is a weekday. Don't you want to be well-rested for school tomorrow? Nene: Okay... If you all have no reservations, then I suppose we can end things here for today.  Meguru: Alright, then see you guys tomorrow!  Nene: See you tomorrow. Shuuji: Alright... I got the milk, and I got the kinpira burdock. Clerk: Alright, here you are! That'll be 605 Yen. Shuuji: Here.  Clerk: 605 exactly. Thank you, thank you. Please come see us again. Shuuji: Phew, NOW I'm done. Time to go on home and get some din?Hm? Nene: ...... Nene: Huh? Ah, hello, Hoshina-kun! What are you doing here? Shuuji: Nothing much. Just doing some shopping before dinner. What're you up to?  Shuuji: I noticed you pacing around for some time.  Nene: Y-You just stood there and watched? Why didn't you come up and say something sooner... Shuuji: Sorry, I was just a little confused, so I wound up staring. Are you out grocery shopping too? Nene: No, not quite.

            "Shuuji: O-Oh, right. I'm supposed to call her by her first name now. Shuuji: Meguru... Meguru... Okay... Shuuji: The taste from... Meguru... Shuuji: Huh? D-Does it? Taichi: Yeah. You used to have the eyes of a dead fish, but now you've passed the point of a resurrected fish all the way to a bouncy, fresh fish. Shuuji: Er, sorry, but I have no idea what you're saying... Taichi: Ah! Something nice must've happened, huh? I see how it is. Maybe you're the fisherman, and you caught someone? You snagged a bouncy, fresh fish for yourself? Shuuji: No, I haven't! Could you stop teasing me first thing in the morning? That's messed― Shuuji: Oh... Give me a moment. I got a text. Shuuji: I've hardly ever used them before, so I don't have a clue what I'm doing― Taichi: Heh... *grin* Shuuji: Ah?! I-It's not like that, Dad! Taichi: Don't worry about me, Son. You meeting up with someone? Or are you having lunch together? Shuuji: Ugh... A-Anyway, I'm sorry but I gotta go now! I'll do the laundry after school, so just leave it be for now! Taichi: Sure. See you later. And good luck! Meguru: Ah! Senpai! Helloha! Shuuji: Pheew... G-Good morning. Meguru: You're breathing pretty heavily. Did you run all the way here? Shuuji: N-No, I didn't. Meguru: Ahaha... Yeah, I just felt like it when I woke up this morning. Meguru: And Senpai, what was up with that emoticon...? Pfft, that made it seem like you were all flustered. Shuuji: Oh, yeah... My bad, Inaba-san. I wanted to use one since you did, but I don't know jack about emoticons... Meguru: ...... Shuuji: H-Huh? Inaba-san? Meguru: *stare* Shuuji: Inaba―Ah! Shuuji: Sorry! Umm... Meguru. Meguru: That's right! I almost thought you forgot already. Meguru: But I'll forgive you since you remembered in the end. Let's go, Senpai! Shuuji: ...Huh? We're going this way again? Meguru: Of course. This way has just become that kinda way for us, you know? Shuuji: That kinda way...? You mean like, a way just for us, so we can talk? Meguru: Haha, actually saying that out loud is so lame. Shuuji: It's really hard to get what sets you off and what doesn't, you know that?! Meguru: I don't know what you're talking about. Meguru: ...Umm, by the way, Senpai. Shuuji: Huh? Wh-What's up? Meguru: You know, there's actually something I'd like to ask of you. That's partly why I texted you. Shuuji: Yeah? What is it? Meguru: You remember how I told you all that stuff on the way home last Friday? Shuuji: Ah... Shuuji: Huh? You mean... Meguru: Umm... From Nene-senpai and the others, I mean. Shuuji: Huh? Go on... Meguru: How do I put this... More importantly than that... Meguru: I just, well... I only want you to know. Shuuji: ...... Meguru: I'm not really sure why myself... Ahaha, yeah... Shuuji: ...Got it. I'll keep it to myself. Meguru: Ah... Shuuji: (I mean, even putting that aside...) Shuuji: (...Sorry, Meguru. I know I just promised you, but...) Shuuji: Yeah, thanks. Shuuji: Well, the thing is... Shuuji: (Do you two know anyone who could search for someone?) Shuuji: (Yeah. I'm trying find someone who went missing.) Nene: (...Is this somehow related to Inaba-san's fragments?) Tsumugi: (Oh, right. Ayachi-san told me about that. That's why you've been so concerned with Meguru-chan lately, right?) Shuuji: (Yeah... That's right.) Shuuji: (I'll give you the details later, but it seems like she her best friend disappeared and she doesn't know where she is.) Tsumugi: (...Really?) Shuuji: (She left without saying goodbye... I think the incident left her scarred. Now I want to find that friend of hers.) Tsumugi: (Oh... She went through all that?) Nene: (...Okay. I understand.) Nene: (I don't know anyone with people finding skills, but I'll at least ask who I can for now.) Tsumugi: (Oh, I'll help out too. Not just because of the fragments. I want to help Meguru-chan.) Shuuji: (Thanks. I really appreciate it.) Tsumugi: (Also, is it okay to tell Togakushi-senpai about this too? She knows a lot of people, so she could be really helpful.) Shuuji: (Yeah, would be great if you could. I can definitely see her being a big help.) Tsumugi: (I'm sure she will! Okay, I'll ask her.) Shuuji: (But one more thing. I would like you to keep this all from her for now.) Nene: (...Why is that?) Shuuji: (Umm... The truth is, she asked me to keep it a secret. Said she doesn't want anyone but me to know since it's embarrassing to her.) Tsumugi: (Oh?) Shuuji: (Besides, we might not be able to find the girl. I don't want to disappoint her or anything. So I'd really appreciate it if you kept quiet about this until we know more.) Nene: (...Alright. Understood.) Tsumugi: (But... Hey, Ayachi-san. This is definitely how I think it is, right?) Nene: (I think so. I can't see it any other way.) Shuuji: (...Huh? What're you talking about?) Tsumugi: (Ahaha, you can be so dense about this stuff.) Tsumugi: (Isn't it obvious? Meguru-chan actually―) Meguru: Excuse me! Tsumugi: Ah?! Meguru: Oh, you're all together! Meguru: Do you really have to ask? I came to hang out. Meguru: Alright! Don't mind me. Meguru: Hey, Nene-senpai, Tsumugi-senpai! I've come over to chat! Shuuji: ...... Tsumugi: H-Huh? With us, you mean? Meguru: You bet. We haven't seen each other or talked since Friday. Meguru: Oh, I'm not bothering you by coming, am I? Tsumugi: N-No! Not at all. Meguru: Ahaha, great! I'm happy to hear that. Nene: Is it okay to ignore Hoshina-kun like that, though? Shuuji: Huh? O-Oh, uh... Meguru: (...! ...!) Tsumugi: I'm pretty sure he didn't say anything... Meguru: Senpai, Senpai. You don't mind, do you? Shuuji: Nah, it's okay, Meguru. If you've come to see the two of them, then I'll let you guys be. Nene, Tsumugi: ...... Meguru: No one said you had to go away or anything. You can stay and watch in silence. Shuuji: Isn't this just bullying?! Meguru: Not at all! I'm just asking you to kindly watch over me. Shuuji: Ugh... Okay, enough with the puppy-dog eyes, Meguru. Meguru: What's the matter? Please watch over me, Senpai! Hideaki: Uh, excuse me. Comment from the peanut gallery, here. Meguru: Huh?! Wh-What the! Wh-Wh-What is it?! Hideaki: Okay, so... Ahem. Hideaki: Isn't Shuuji the only one you're chatting with?! Meguru: Ah... Wakana: Ah, sorry for butting in. I'm Kariya Wakana, and this guy is Kaidou Hideaki. We're Hoshina's friends. Meguru: O-Oh! I'm Inaba Meguru. Wakana: Anyway... Ahem. Wakana: Hoshina, since when have you been calling her by her first name without honorifics?! Shuuji: Ah... Tsumugi: Yes! That's right! I was just thinking that! Nice one, Kariya-san! Nene: So was I. I think we all were wondering about that. Up until now, he has been calling her by her last name with an honorific... Meguru: Ah, er, umm, about that, it's like...! Meguru: Huh? Ah, er... Shuuji: We've become pretty good friends, so I asked if I could start using her first name. Shuuji: And, well, a plain and simple \"Meguru\" without honorifics is what felt right to me, so I just went with that. Hideaki: Huh... I see. Gotta say, that's not like you. Shuuji: Yeah, you're not wrong. But I've never had a junior in a club before, so... Wakana: It didn't feel right treating her like an underclassman forever? Kinda like how they do it in sports clubs. Didn't know you had that side to you, Hoshina. Shuuji: Is there something wrong with that? It's not like this girl holds anything back like a typical underclassman. Wakana: Yeah, I can see that. She seems kinda over-familiar... Oh, sorry, I didn't mean that in a bad way. She just seems quite attached with how she's all \"Senpai, Senpai!\" Nene: So nothing special happened between you two that led to you calling her by her first name? Tsumugi: That's kind of a bummer... Shuuji: Y-Yeah, nothing special happened! Right, Meguru? Meguru: Huh?! D-Dat's right! Shuuji: Anyway, isn't it about time for you to head back to your classroom? Lunch break is almost over. Meguru: Ah... Oh yeah! I'll do that! Meguru: I-I'm leaving then! See you all later! Meguru: So I thought, next time I should have you come over to my place instead. Shuuji: I can't turn you down when you put it like that. Shuuji: Well, we're both ditching club for the day to do this... Meguru: But Nene-senpai said that it was okay. Shuuji: Yeah, I guess. Shuuji: (......) Shuuji: (I'm trying my best to ignore that delicious bittersweet taste from earlier.) Shuuji: Huh, you live pretty close to the station. Meguru: We could have passed through the shopping district to get to my place too, but I thought it'd be better to take a route that's easier to remember. Shuuji: ...Does that mean there is going to be a second time? Meguru: Why do you always have to ask these things out loud? Seriously, Senpai... Man. Shuuji: Wh-What's so bad about it? That's just how important it is. Meguru: O-Oh, it's important? Shuuji: Sure is. At least to me. Meguru: ...You don't ever change, do you? Shuuji: What's that supposed to mean? Meguru: Ah, we have to turn the corner here. Shuuji: Oh... Meguru: We're there. This is my house. Shuuji: Huh? Sure... Meguru: I'm baaack! Shuuji: It's about damn―Bueeh?! Shuuji: ...... Meguru: Senpai, you should see the look on your face right now. Shuuji: I mean, it didn't even cross my mind that you'd make me wait just to change again... Meguru: I like to kick back and relax at home, so I went ahead and changed into something more comfortable. Shuuji: Then why didn't you come to meet me in those clothes?!  Meguru: Because this way I get to surprise you. I knew you'd never expect me to change a second time. Shuuji: This was seriously all part of your plan? You sure went out of your way... Meguru: Really, though, this is loungewear. I can't wear this stuff outside. Meguru: So, what do you think? Surprised? Shuuji: Yeah, I really didn't expect you to change a second time. Though, your new getup is surprising too. You give off a completely different vibe than usual in that outfit. Meguru: That's right. Hehe. That surprise you too? Well, you had no way of knowing since I never told you. Meguru: Do the glasses make a big difference?  Shuuji: Hmm... They do make you look more plain than usual. Meguru: This is how I always looked before entering Himematsu. Shuuji: ...You mean, before your makeover? Meguru: Yep! Standing before you is an elusive Meguru that hardly anyone else gets to see. Meguru: It's gotten kinda embarrassing to show myself in public like this now. I look way too plain. I don't want to come off as a slob. Shuuji: ...But you're okay looking like this in front of me? Meguru: Hehehe. I'm making an exception for you. Your reactions are worth it! Meguru: I'd like you to keep this a secret as well. Shuuji: Y-Yeah, sure... Shuuji: That's a pretty sweet weapon, but I'm a lance player. Not like getting that gun would do me any good. Meguru: What the heck? Why aren't you jealous?! Meguru: Well, whatever. I know you'll think differently after Lavie here saves your butt with her shiny new weapon.  Shuuji: Guh. Well, yeah, I'm pretty much relying on you to carry me... as always... Shuuji: Gotta say, though. Playing with each other while sitting face-to-face is a completely different experience. Meguru: Right? This way you won't get horrifically murderized when you try to thank me! Shuuji: You didn't have to bring that up again, Lavie-san! Meguru: Sorry, but it was too funny. I don't think I'll ever forget how you just stopped and got your face kicked in. Shuuji: I was actually moved by how skilled yet kind the mysterious Lavie-san was... I was shocked when I saw who was behind the character. Meguru: What the heck? I'm not any different from Lavie! Just look at how good she is at coordinating her outfit. Shuuji: Can't deny that. That armor set is pretty dang cool. Meguru: I know, right?! I had to do so much grinding to get the whole set. Hehe! Shuuji: The hair and armor colors even match. It's kinda hot, or more like sexy... Nice job. Meguru: How could you say that to the person playing the character? Gross. Shuuji: I was just trying to compliment your fashion sense, since you seem to take pride in that... Meguru: Ugh... Meguru: Th-Then you should say that about me instead. Shuuji: Huh? Meguru: Don't \"huh\" me! What's with that answer? Don't you want to compliment me? Meguru: Lavie's player is, umm... confident about her own fashion as well... Shuuji: Oh, you look pretty sexy too. Meguru: Buh?! Wh-Wh-Wh-What're you saying?! Shuuji: Well, just look at how you're always showing off your legs... Meguru: M-M-Maybe, but... we're talking about my fashion sense! Not my legs! Shuuji: But going with bare legs is an intentional decision, isn't it? That's a conscious fashion choice. Meguru: Okay, true! But still! Ahh, geez! Shuuji: When I first saw you at school, I thought you looked like a bit of a floozy. But on closer inspection, it's really more of a casual cute style. Meguru: ...... Shuuji: I can tell you put some serious thought into picking a jumper that would match with your uniform. You give off a vibrant, playful vibe, like that of a younger girl. It's really fitting for you. Meguru: Y-Yeah? Ehehe, I spent a lot of time coordinating that outfit. It's my pride and joy♪ Meguru: Senpai, Senpai, praise me more! Shuuji: Sorry, but that's all I got. I'm having trouble remembering anything else to say from the fashion magazines I flipped through... Meguru: ...There goes most of the goodwill you just garnered. Shuuji: You're pretty easy to flatter, huh? Meguru: And there goes the rest. Shuuji: Sorry, I went a little too far there... Meguru: Whatever. Let's just go and do a quest. Shuuji: Oh, okay... I guess I'll back you up... Meguru: Pfft, haha... You don't have to act so depressed. Shuuji: Ah, you cheering up again? Meguru: Geez, I don't believe you. Yeah, I'll cheer up and shoot you full healing bullets～ Shuuji: Huh? Did you make these just for me...? Meguru: No, I made them yesterday. I was just in the mood for it. Shuuji: Ah... Still, though. Thanks. I'll dig right in. Meguru: Yeah, go ahead! Shuuji: ...Oh, this is great! It's sweet and sour, but also has a slightly bitter aftertaste. I really like it. Meguru: Oh, awesome! Meguru: Hearing everyone's impression is the best part of making any dessert. Shuuji: No, really, you're seriously good at this. Every treat of yours I've eaten has been delicious. Shuuji: You're a pretty good cook in general, aren't you? Like in MonHun, you've got quite a few hidden talents. Meguru: Oh, thank... Well, umm... Meguru: I guess you could say I'm a bit of a homebody. I tend to spend most of my free time at home. Shuuji: Oh, I see. That makes sense... Meguru: Yeah, basically. Shuuji: What kind of books do you like? The genres on your shelf seem all over the place. Meguru: Good question... I don't have specific preferences. I read pretty much everything. Shuuji: Huh... Got any examples? Meguru: The last thing I read was an Irish poem collection. Before that was some celebrity's street food travelogue, and before that an isekai harem light novel, I think? Shuuji: Holy crap, that spread... You'll read just about anything, huh? Meguru: Lately though I've been playing games a lot more than reading. I play stuff other than MonHun too. Shuuji: Yeah, I see the console. Oh... l-looks like you're into otome games. Meguru: Heck yeah. With headphones on! Those sexy male voices make my heart pound in ways that― Meguru: Wait, how did you know?! Shuuji: Err, there's what looks like one laying out in the open over there... Meguru: Huh?! Aaah! I-I forgot to put it awaaay! Shuuji: I-It's okay! I play that kinda stuff too! Meguru: What?! You're a guy who plays otome games?! Shuuji: No, I tend to play games aimed at guys... Meguru: For guys...? Y-You mean porn games? Ugh, you actually play that filth? You're the worst... Shuuji: What an absurd double standard. Don't just assume that any visual novel for guys is an adult PC game! There's a lot of perfectly normal stuff on consoles! Shuuji: Wait, why do you even know about those kinds of games...? Meguru: Uhh... Shuuji: You actually play those, don't you?! Meguru: I-I do not! How dare you suggest that?! I've had enough of your super-perv antics! Shuuji: Don't pretend like you're not accusing me of the same thing! This is such a double standard! Shuuji: No, thank you. For the tart, and― Meguru's Mom: Oh my, you're going home already? Meguru: Wha?! Shuuji: Oh, uh, yes! Thanks for having me! Meguru: M-Mom!! Why did you come out?! Meguru's Mom: This is the first friend you've brought over in so long. Of course I'd want to say hello! Meguru's Mom: And it's a boy too? How exciting! Meguru: Geez! I thought I told you to stay clear! Besides, you're getting the wrong idea! Meguru: It's not like you think! He's just an upperclassman from my club! Meguru's Mom: Thank you for taking care of my daughter. Ahh, I wish my husband was here to see you too... Meguru: Mooom! Geeez! Shuuji: Er, I really need to go now! You'll have to let me off for today! Thanks again! Shuuji: ...... Nene: Huh? Is that you, Hoshina-kun? Shuuji: Oh... Hey there, Ayachi-san. On your way home? Nene: Yes. The sun was setting, so we called it a day. Nene: Weren't you supposed to be somewhere with Inaba-san? Shuuji: Yeah, but we called it a day for the same reason. Nene: I see... Shuuji: Yeah... Nene: ...... Nene: I've got some news, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Ah... Wh-What is it? Nene: It seems that Togakushi-senpai is willing to help us. Shuuji: Huh? You mean... Nene: About Inaba-san's missing friend. Shuuji: ...... Nene: Since Inaba-san's friend was her classmate, Togakushi-senpai said she would get in touch with some people she knows from the schools near their old one and have them check the student registers there. Shuuji: I see... Nene: ...Hoshina-kun? Shuuji: Yeah... Meguru: \"I'd like you to keep this a secret as well.\" Shuuji: (But if there's a thorn still stuck in her heart, I want to remove it for her.) Shuuji: \"W-Well, yeah... We do...\" Meguru: \"So I feel a certain kinship with you.\" Shuuji: Are you free right now? This would be a good time for me to share the details. "

Didn't know you had that side to you, Hoshina. Shuuji: Is there something wrong with that? It's not like this girl holds anything back like a typical underclassman. Wakana: Yeah, I can see that. She seems kinda over-familiar... Oh, sorry, I didn't mean that in a bad way. She just seems quite attached with how she's all \"Senpai, Senpai!\" Nene: So nothing special happened between you two that led to you calling her by her first name? Tsumugi: That's kind of a bummer... Shuuji: Y-Yeah, nothing special happened! Right, Meguru? Meguru: Huh?! D-Dat's right! Shuuji: Anyway, isn't it about time for you to head back to your classroom? Lunch break is almost over. Meguru: Ah... Oh yeah! I'll do that! Meguru: I-I'm leaving then! See you all later! Meguru: So I thought, next time I should have you come over to my place instead. Shuuji: I can't turn you down when you put it like that. Shuuji: Well, we're both ditching club for the day to do this... Meguru: But Nene-senpai said that it was okay. Shuuji: Yeah, I guess. Shuuji: (......) Shuuji: (I'm trying my best to ignore that delicious bittersweet taste from earlier.) Shuuji: Huh, you live pretty close to the station. Meguru: We could have passed through the shopping district to get to my place too, but I thought it'd be better to take a route that's easier to remember. Shuuji: ...Does that mean there is going to be a second time? Meguru: Why do you always have to ask these things out loud? Seriously, Senpai... Man. Shuuji: Wh-What's so bad about it? That's just how important it is. Meguru: O-Oh, it's important? Shuuji: Sure is. At least to me. Meguru: ...You don't ever change, do you? Shuuji: What's that supposed to mean? Meguru: Ah, we have to turn the corner here. Shuuji: Oh... Meguru: We're there. This is my house. Shuuji: Huh? Sure... Meguru: I'm baaack! Shuuji: It's about damn―Bueeh?! Shuuji: ...... Meguru: Senpai, you should see the look on your face right now. Shuuji: I mean, it didn't even cross my mind that you'd make me wait just to change again... Meguru: I like to kick back and relax at home, so I went ahead and changed into something more comfortable. Shuuji: Then why didn't you come to meet me in those clothes?!  Meguru: Because this way I get to surprise you. I knew you'd never expect me to change a second time. Shuuji: This was seriously all part of your plan? You sure went out of your way... Meguru: Really, though, this is loungewear. I can't wear this stuff outside. Meguru: So, what do you think? Surprised? Shuuji: Yeah, I really didn't expect you to change a second time. Though, your new getup is surprising too. You give off a completely different vibe than usual in that outfit. Meguru: That's right. Hehe. That surprise you too? Well, you had no way of knowing since I never told you. Meguru: Do the glasses make a big difference?  Shuuji: Hmm... They do make you look more plain than usual. Meguru: This is how I always looked before entering Himematsu. Shuuji: ...You mean, before your makeover? Meguru: Yep! Standing before you is an elusive Meguru that hardly anyone else gets to see. Meguru: It's gotten kinda embarrassing to show myself in public like this now. I look way too plain. I don't want to come off as a slob. Shuuji: ...But you're okay looking like this in front of me? Meguru: Hehehe. I'm making an exception for you. Your reactions are worth it! Meguru: I'd like you to keep this a secret as well. Shuuji: Y-Yeah, sure... Shuuji: That's a pretty sweet weapon, but I'm a lance player. Not like getting that gun would do me any good. Meguru: What the heck? Why aren't you jealous?! Meguru: Well, whatever. I know you'll think differently after Lavie here saves your butt with her shiny new weapon.  Shuuji: Guh. Well, yeah, I'm pretty much relying on you to carry me... as always... Shuuji: Gotta say, though. Playing with each other while sitting face-to-face is a completely different experience. Meguru: Right? This way you won't get horrifically murderized when you try to thank me! Shuuji: You didn't have to bring that up again, Lavie-san! Meguru: Sorry, but it was too funny. I don't think I'll ever forget how you just stopped and got your face kicked in. Shuuji: I was actually moved by how skilled yet kind the mysterious Lavie-san was... I was shocked when I saw who was behind the character. Meguru: What the heck? I'm not any different from Lavie! Just look at how good she is at coordinating her outfit. Shuuji: Can't deny that. That armor set is pretty dang cool. Meguru: I know, right?! I had to do so much grinding to get the whole set. Hehe! Shuuji: The hair and armor colors even match. It's kinda hot, or more like sexy... Nice job. Meguru: How could you say that to the person playing the character? Gross. Shuuji: I was just trying to compliment your fashion sense, since you seem to take pride in that... Meguru: Ugh... Meguru: Th-Then you should say that about me instead. Shuuji: Huh? Meguru: Don't \"huh\" me! What's with that answer? Don't you want to compliment me? Meguru: Lavie's player is, umm... confident about her own fashion as well... Shuuji: Oh, you look pretty sexy too. Meguru: Buh?! Wh-Wh-Wh-What're you saying?! Shuuji: Well, just look at how you're always showing off your legs... Meguru: M-M-Maybe, but... we're talking about my fashion sense! Not my legs! Shuuji: But going with bare legs is an intentional decision, isn't it? That's a conscious fashion choice. Meguru: Okay, true! But still! Ahh, geez! Shuuji: When I first saw you at school, I thought you looked like a bit of a floozy. But on closer inspection, it's really more of a casual cute style. Meguru: ...... Shuuji: I can tell you put some serious thought into picking a jumper that would match with your uniform. You give off a vibrant, playful vibe, like that of a younger girl. It's really fitting for you. Meguru: Y-Yeah? Ehehe, I spent a lot of time coordinating that outfit. It's my pride and joy♪ Meguru: Senpai, Senpai, praise me more! Shuuji: Sorry, but that's all I got. I'm having trouble remembering anything else to say from the fashion magazines I flipped through... Meguru: ...There goes most of the goodwill you just garnered. Shuuji: You're pretty easy to flatter, huh? Meguru: And there goes the rest. Shuuji: Sorry, I went a little too far there... Meguru: Whatever. Let's just go and do a quest. Shuuji: Oh, okay... I guess I'll back you up... Meguru: Pfft, haha... You don't have to act so depressed. Shuuji: Ah, you cheering up again? Meguru: Geez, I don't believe you. Yeah, I'll cheer up and shoot you full healing bullets～ Shuuji: Huh? Did you make these just for me...? Meguru: No, I made them yesterday. I was just in the mood for it. Shuuji: Ah... Still, though. Thanks. I'll dig right in. Meguru: Yeah, go ahead! Shuuji: ...Oh, this is great! It's sweet and sour, but also has a slightly bitter aftertaste. I really like it. Meguru: Oh, awesome! Meguru: Hearing everyone's impression is the best part of making any dessert. Shuuji: No, really, you're seriously good at this. Every treat of yours I've eaten has been delicious. Shuuji: You're a pretty good cook in general, aren't you? Like in MonHun, you've got quite a few hidden talents. Meguru: Oh, thank... Well, umm... Meguru: I guess you could say I'm a bit of a homebody. I tend to spend most of my free time at home. Shuuji: Oh, I see. That makes sense... Meguru: Yeah, basically. Shuuji: What kind of books do you like? The genres on your shelf seem all over the place. Meguru: Good question... I don't have specific preferences. I read pretty much everything. Shuuji: Huh... Got any examples? Meguru: The last thing I read was an Irish poem collection. Before that was some celebrity's street food travelogue, and before that an isekai harem light novel, I think? Shuuji: Holy crap, that spread... You'll read just about anything, huh? Meguru: Lately though I've been playing games a lot more than reading. I play stuff other than MonHun too. Shuuji: Yeah, I see the console. Oh... l-looks like you're into otome games. Meguru: Heck yeah. With headphones on! Those sexy male voices make my heart pound in ways that― Meguru: Wait, how did you know?! Shuuji: Err, there's what looks like one laying out in the open over there... Meguru: Huh?! Aaah! I-I forgot to put it awaaay! Shuuji: I-It's okay! I play that kinda stuff too! Meguru: What?! You're a guy who plays otome games?! Shuuji: No, I tend to play games aimed at guys... Meguru: For guys...? Y-You mean porn games? Ugh, you actually play that filth? You're the worst... Shuuji: What an absurd double standard. Don't just assume that any visual novel for guys is an adult PC game! There's a lot of perfectly normal stuff on consoles! Shuuji: Wait, why do you even know about those kinds of games...? Meguru: Uhh... Shuuji: You actually play those, don't you?! Meguru: I-I do not! How dare you suggest that?! I've had enough of your super-perv antics! Shuuji: Don't pretend like you're not accusing me of the same thing! This is such a double standard! Shuuji: No, thank you. For the tart, and― Meguru's Mom: Oh my, you're going home already? Meguru: Wha?! Shuuji: Oh, uh, yes! Thanks for having me! Meguru: M-Mom!! Why did you come out?! Meguru's Mom: This is the first friend you've brought over in so long. Of course I'd want to say hello! Meguru's Mom: And it's a boy too? How exciting! Meguru: Geez! I thought I told you to stay clear! Besides, you're getting the wrong idea! Meguru: It's not like you think! He's just an upperclassman from my club! Meguru's Mom: Thank you for taking care of my daughter. Ahh, I wish my husband was here to see you too... Meguru: Mooom! Geeez! Shuuji: Er, I really need to go now! You'll have to let me off for today! Thanks again! Shuuji: ...... Nene: Huh? Is that you, Hoshina-kun? Shuuji: Oh... Hey there, Ayachi-san. On your way home? Nene: Yes. The sun was setting, so we called it a day. Nene: Weren't you supposed to be somewhere with Inaba-san? Shuuji: Yeah, but we called it a day for the same reason. Nene: I see... Shuuji: Yeah... Nene: ...... Nene: I've got some news, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Ah... Wh-What is it? Nene: It seems that Togakushi-senpai is willing to help us. Shuuji: Huh? You mean... Nene: About Inaba-san's missing friend. Shuuji: ...... Nene: Since Inaba-san's friend was her classmate, Togakushi-senpai said she would get in touch with some people she knows from the schools near their old one and have them check the student registers there. Shuuji: I see... Nene: ...Hoshina-kun? Shuuji: Yeah... Meguru: \"I'd like you to keep this a secret as well.\" Shuuji: (But if there's a thorn still stuck in her heart, I want to remove it for her.) Shuuji: \"W-Well, yeah... We do...\" Meguru: \"So I feel a certain kinship with you.\" Shuuji: Are you free right now?

            "Meguru: Hey, guess what? I brought cupcakes! Tsumugi, Touko: Oooh♪ Tsumugi: Oh, yeah. Your cookies and pudding were great! I'm sure your cupcakes are good too. Meguru: They turned out pretty well, I think. Alright, here you go, Tsumugi-senpai! Tsumugi: Wow♪ Thanks～ Meguru: Togakushi-senpai, here's yours! Touko: Ooh♪ This is such a wonderful surprise. Thank you. Nene: Can I try one as well? Meguru: Of course you can! I made a ton of 'em. There's no way I'd leave you out!  Meguru: So here, take one! Nene: Thank you very much. I'll have a taste. Shuuji: Oh... Thanks. A girl's homemade cupcake, huh... Meguru: I'm sure you'll like it. Shuuji: You've been pretty cheerful lately, I have to say. Meguru: Yeah, thanks to you. Tsumugi: Oh! It's great, Meguru-chan! Meguru: Really? I'm glad you like it! Touko: It's so moist and fluffy. You didn't just use some pre-packaged mix, right? I can tell you put some real effort into these. The nuts are a great touch. Nene: It's really good, Inaba-san. This tastes just as good as the stuff they sell at bakeries.  Meguru: Wow! Nene-senpai, that's so nice of you to say! Nene: Sh-Shouldn't you sit and eat your own share? Meguru: Oh, well, maybe you should feed me. Just kidding! Nene: ...? What's the matter, Inaba-san? Meguru: Oh, nothing! Meguru: Okay, I'll eat mine now. Nene: Alright, let's call it a day here. Tsumugi: 'Kay! Meguru: Ahaha. You're welcome. Shuuji: Welp, time to head home. Meguru: Ah, Senpai, Senpai. Meguru: Are you free after this? Shuuji: I guess, yeah. Meguru: Then, well... let's go home together! Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Umm... Is this another cupcake? Meguru: Y-You don't want it? Shuuji: Of course I do! I was just surprised. Shuuji: Umm... You went out of your way to make me an extra one? Meguru: ...Well, you're the one I made that promise with. Shuuji: Y-Yeah, I guess. Shuuji: Oh... Meguru: I-I'm the one thanking you, here. Meguru: Come on. Hurry up and eat it. Go, go. Shuuji: Yeah, thanks. I can't wait! Shuuji: No, you did good! It's just a little messy because I can't stop smiling while I eat. Meguru: ...... Shuuji: *munch* *munch* Yeah, it's great. This tastes awesome, Inaba-san. Meguru: ...E-Ehehehe. Meguru: Ah! Now you're making me smile and laugh too, geez! Shuuji: Huh? How is that my fault? Meguru: 'Cuz what kind of dope smiles while they eat? Meguru: You're welcome. Shuuji: Though, to be honest... I wish I had something to drink along with it. It tasted great, but now my mouth is dry. Meguru: Oh... Y-You're right! I'm sorry I didn't think of that! Meguru: Umm, there's a vending machine down the side street we talked on the other day, right? Let's go! Shuuji: Nah, no need to take a detour just for that. I was only half serious, anyway. Meguru: Oh, okay, right... Meguru: Yeah...? Shuuji: I'll take that detour after all. Wanna tag along? I wouldn't mind chatting more with you. Meguru: Ah... Meguru: Yeah! Of course! Meguru: There we go. Meguru: Hm? What's wrong, Senpai? Shuuji: Oh, nothing. Shuuji: For sure. Meguru: That's good. I was afraid you wouldn't want to eat any of my treats anymore. Shuuji: I'd never turn down more treats from you. It'd be awesome if I could have more sometime. Meguru: Roger that. Next time I'll make something easier to eat. Meguru: So... What did you want to talk about now?  Shuuji: Hm? Meguru: Don't \"hm\" me! Didn't you just say you wanted to chat some more? Shuuji: O-Ohh... Right... Meguru: You want to know? Shuuji: Yeah. After getting this involved, I'm kinda curious. I haven't heard any of the details yet. Meguru: Hmm, let's see... Meguru: Nene-senpai kept chatting away about nothing in particular. Shuuji: Oh yeah? Meguru: Other than that, I made dinner to show my thanks for letting me sleep over... Meguru: Oh, right! We also took a bath together! And even better, it was Nene-senpai who invited me for that! Meguru: And before you ask, we didn't wash each other or anything. But man, Nene-senpai has such a nice figure and pretty skin. I'm a girl and was still totally captivated. It's not fair how she gets to be both slender and voluptuous. Shuuji: Y-You don't say... Meguru: Hey, I know that look! You're picturing her right now, aren't you?! You perv! Shuuji: You can't blame me after you're the one who said all that stuff. Shuuji: Erm, I was picturing you this time. Meguru: WHAT?! Wh-Why me?! Meguru: Why would you imagine ME naked?! Compared to Nene-senpai, I'm basically flat! Shuuji: Well, I think you're both really attractive. A flat girl like you can still be hot! Meguru: ―――?! Shuuji: Err, sorry! This has been really rude of me! Forget I said anything! Meguru: W-Will do. I'll try my best! You... You see, jokes like that don't faze me one bit! Shuuji: Huh? R-Right... Meguru: R-Right! Nene-senpai was worried about whether I'm getting along with my classmates!  Shuuji: Ahh... Meguru: Y-Yeah. True, we took a bath together, ate cake together and all that... Meguru: ...... Shuuji: ...Inaba-san? Meguru: I'm sure you're curious about that too, huh? Shuuji: Huh? A-About what? Meguru: About why I decided to get a makeover when entering Himematsu. Shuuji: Well... Meguru: Yeah. Our conversation ended up there. Meguru: I didn't tell her anything. Shuuji: Huh? Meguru: It's a hard subject for me, so I just sorta glossed over it. Shuuji: ...... Meguru: But it makes me wonder if it's been weighing on her mind. And if it's been weighing on your mind as well... Shuuji: Umm...  Didn't you tell us before that you got a makeover to make yourself more approachable? Meguru: I did, and it's true, but I'm talking about what made me want to do that in the first place. Shuuji: O-Oh. Yeah... Meguru: ...... Meguru: Ah... Meguru: O-Okay. It's not a very enjoyable story, though... Ahaha... Shuuji: I don't mind. I'm just happy that you're willing to tell me. Meguru: ...Thank you. Shuuji: Alright. Go ahead. Meguru: She may have been my only one, but we were really close. We were best friends. Shuuji: ...You didn't have any other friends? Meguru: You know how clingy I can be, right? Well, back then, it was even worse. Meguru: I could be myself around Chi-chan, but not any of the other girls... Shuuji: Chi-chan, huh? Meguru: Yeah. Kizuki Chihoko. I always called her Chi-chan. Meguru: She was a very frail and quiet girl. She was a huge bookworm, though, and was super smart. Meguru: I did nothing but read books too, so we had a shared hobby and matching personalities. Meguru: I could tell her all the things that I couldn't tell anyone else. I told her everything... Meguru: ...But maybe that was the problem. Meguru: To make things worse, I tend to jabber on incessantly when I get excited. Meguru: Basically, I'm completely unfettered when it comes to everyone I'm close with... Shuuji: Yeah, I can see that. Meguru: ...... Meguru: Chi-chan stopped coming to school all of a sudden. Shuuji: Huh? Meguru: I had no idea why. She just stopped coming... Meguru: She never answered my calls or texts either. Meguru: After a while of that, I couldn't take it anymore and went over to her place. Meguru: But when I got there... her house was completely vacant. Shuuji: Huh...? Meguru: So I asked our homeroom teacher, but he wouldn't tell me anything. All he would say was that she left our school. Meguru: And now... I still have no idea where Chi-chan is or what she's currently doing... Shuuji: So... what you're saying is that she suddenly moved away and never told you? Meguru: She didn't tell me anything. She wouldn't even answer my texts or calls. Meguru: But I just figured that it made sense. Shuuji: ...Why's that? Meguru: I said something terrible to Chi-chan right before she stopped coming to school. Meguru: \"I can't get along with anyone else, but you're the only friend I want.\" Meguru: \"It's the same for you, right? So let's be friends forever.\" Shuuji: What's so terrible about that? Meguru: But when I think back on it now, I realize how put off she looked when I said that. Meguru: It was almost like I said something revolting to her... Shuuji: ...... Meguru: That's why I figured it must have been my fault that she didn't tell me anything. Meguru: Maybe it hurt her when I told her she didn't have any other friends than me. Meguru: I would say inconsiderate stuff like that and act like a selfish kid around her all the time. Maybe that was too much for her. Meguru: That must be why she disappeared from my life completely... Shuuji: But... Meguru: Partly because I lost my best friend... Meguru: But also, with Chi-chan gone, I was back to being without a single friend I could open up to. Shuuji: Ah... Meguru: So after that, I just became an introverted bookworm. Meguru: I knew I was too annoying to be good at making friends, so I was too scared to ever try again. Meguru: I also felt like I'd never get a friendship like Chi-chan's again, anyway. Meguru: And besides, not even my best friend Chi-chan wanted to be friends with me anymore. Shuuji: ...I see. Meguru: I decided I couldn't let things continue like that. Shuuji: ...... Meguru: I wanted to get good at socializing and tried my best to achieve that. Meguru: So if I were to meet Chi-chan again... I could apologize to her and tell her that I'm different now. Shuuji: ...And that's why you changed yourself when you entered Himematsu. Meguru: Yeah, exactly. Shuuji: I see... Meguru: ...I-I'm sorry. I just ended up spewing some boring, incomprehensible nonsense! Meguru: L-Let's talk about something else! Umm, err, like about MonHun― Shuuji: No. I get exactly how you feel. Shuuji: I've gone through some stuff and struggled to talk to people too. Shuuji: I've always had hardly any friends. The most I could ever muster was some smalltalk with my classmates. I would just wear a fake smile and try not to upset anyone. Shuuji: It got to the point where, just a little while back, my own dad told me I had the eyes of a dead fish. Meguru: Ah... Shuuji: Yeah, you've thought the same, I'm sure. Meguru: N-No! I would never think anything like that! I just thought you look kinda gloomy. Like you didn't have any friends and stuff... Shuuji: Yeah, that doesn't make it much better. Meguru: I'm sorry! Shuuji: It's alright. After all, it's the truth. Shuuji: But, you see, circumstances led me to joining the OC where I got in touch with everyone else's worries. That made me take a closer look at myself, which led to a thought. Meguru: Wh-Which is...? Shuuji: That I couldn't let things continue like that. Meguru: ...... Shuuji: I mean, I couldn't even muster a decent smile. It was so stiff that even I thought I looked gross. Shuuji: That inspired me to change myself. To give myself a more natural smile... Meguru: ...I see. Meguru: So you're... the same as me... Shuuji: Do you understand how I felt? Meguru: Y-Yeah! I totally do! It's almost like you were talking about me! Shuuji: Thanks. That is why I feel like I can understand your situation so well.   Shuuji: ...Thanks for telling me. Meguru: D-Don't thank me! I should thank you... Meguru: You told me about yourself, listened to my story and understood me. I'm so happy... Shuuji: Then that makes two of us. Meguru: Seems so... Ahahaha... Shuuji: ...... Meguru: ...... Shuuji: I-I guess it's about time we go home. Meguru: R-R-Right, we've been talking all evening... Meguru: Th-This is far enough. Meguru: Yeah. It's only a few minutes from here, and the streets are well-lit. Shuuji: Okay. Then I'll head home. See you on Monday, Inaba-san. Meguru: Yeah... Meguru: ...Oh, wait a moment! One last thing. Shuuji: Huh? What's up? Meguru: Umm... I don't know how to put this, but, umm... Meguru: I-I know you think you haven't been able to smile well... Shuuji: ...Huh? Meguru: But... Meguru: Your smile has never felt unpleasant to me! Shuuji: ...... Meguru: Y-Yeah... Hehe... Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Ready to have a taste of mine this time? Shuuji: Ahaha, yeah of course you― Meguru: But... Meguru: ...Can I ask for something else instead? Shuuji: What? L-Like, you want me to drink the rest of your cafe au lait or something? Meguru: ...... Shuuji: ...Inaba-san? Meguru: Meguru. Meguru: Could you, from today on... start calling me by my given name? Shuuji: ...... Meguru: ...... Meguru: N-Never mind! I take that back! Forget I said anything! Shuuji: M-Meguru. Meguru: Ah... Shuuji: Is that what you wanted? Meguru: A-Again. One more time. Shuuji: ...Meguru. Meguru: ～～～!! Shuuji: ...Hellooo Meguru. Meguru: That's me!

Meguru: Really? I'm glad you like it! Touko: It's so moist and fluffy. You didn't just use some pre-packaged mix, right? I can tell you put some real effort into these. The nuts are a great touch. Nene: It's really good, Inaba-san. This tastes just as good as the stuff they sell at bakeries.  Meguru: Wow! Nene-senpai, that's so nice of you to say! Nene: Sh-Shouldn't you sit and eat your own share? Meguru: Oh, well, maybe you should feed me. Just kidding! Nene: ...? What's the matter, Inaba-san? Meguru: Oh, nothing! Meguru: Okay, I'll eat mine now. Nene: Alright, let's call it a day here. Tsumugi: 'Kay! Meguru: Ahaha. You're welcome. Shuuji: Welp, time to head home. Meguru: Ah, Senpai, Senpai. Meguru: Are you free after this? Shuuji: I guess, yeah. Meguru: Then, well... let's go home together! Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Umm... Is this another cupcake? Meguru: Y-You don't want it? Shuuji: Of course I do! I was just surprised. Shuuji: Umm... You went out of your way to make me an extra one? Meguru: ...Well, you're the one I made that promise with. Shuuji: Y-Yeah, I guess. Shuuji: Oh... Meguru: I-I'm the one thanking you, here. Meguru: Come on. Hurry up and eat it. Go, go. Shuuji: Yeah, thanks. I can't wait! Shuuji: No, you did good! It's just a little messy because I can't stop smiling while I eat. Meguru: ...... Shuuji: *munch* *munch* Yeah, it's great. This tastes awesome, Inaba-san. Meguru: ...E-Ehehehe. Meguru: Ah! Now you're making me smile and laugh too, geez! Shuuji: Huh? How is that my fault? Meguru: 'Cuz what kind of dope smiles while they eat? Meguru: You're welcome. Shuuji: Though, to be honest... I wish I had something to drink along with it. It tasted great, but now my mouth is dry. Meguru: Oh... Y-You're right! I'm sorry I didn't think of that! Meguru: Umm, there's a vending machine down the side street we talked on the other day, right? Let's go! Shuuji: Nah, no need to take a detour just for that. I was only half serious, anyway. Meguru: Oh, okay, right... Meguru: Yeah...? Shuuji: I'll take that detour after all. Wanna tag along? I wouldn't mind chatting more with you. Meguru: Ah... Meguru: Yeah! Of course! Meguru: There we go. Meguru: Hm? What's wrong, Senpai? Shuuji: Oh, nothing. Shuuji: For sure. Meguru: That's good. I was afraid you wouldn't want to eat any of my treats anymore. Shuuji: I'd never turn down more treats from you. It'd be awesome if I could have more sometime. Meguru: Roger that. Next time I'll make something easier to eat. Meguru: So... What did you want to talk about now?  Shuuji: Hm? Meguru: Don't \"hm\" me! Didn't you just say you wanted to chat some more? Shuuji: O-Ohh... Right... Meguru: You want to know? Shuuji: Yeah. After getting this involved, I'm kinda curious. I haven't heard any of the details yet. Meguru: Hmm, let's see... Meguru: Nene-senpai kept chatting away about nothing in particular. Shuuji: Oh yeah? Meguru: Other than that, I made dinner to show my thanks for letting me sleep over... Meguru: Oh, right! We also took a bath together! And even better, it was Nene-senpai who invited me for that! Meguru: And before you ask, we didn't wash each other or anything. But man, Nene-senpai has such a nice figure and pretty skin. I'm a girl and was still totally captivated. It's not fair how she gets to be both slender and voluptuous. Shuuji: Y-You don't say... Meguru: Hey, I know that look! You're picturing her right now, aren't you?! You perv! Shuuji: You can't blame me after you're the one who said all that stuff. Shuuji: Erm, I was picturing you this time. Meguru: WHAT?! Wh-Why me?! Meguru: Why would you imagine ME naked?! Compared to Nene-senpai, I'm basically flat! Shuuji: Well, I think you're both really attractive. A flat girl like you can still be hot! Meguru: ―――?! Shuuji: Err, sorry! This has been really rude of me! Forget I said anything! Meguru: W-Will do. I'll try my best! You... You see, jokes like that don't faze me one bit! Shuuji: Huh? R-Right... Meguru: R-Right! Nene-senpai was worried about whether I'm getting along with my classmates!  Shuuji: Ahh... Meguru: Y-Yeah. True, we took a bath together, ate cake together and all that... Meguru: ...... Shuuji: ...Inaba-san? Meguru: I'm sure you're curious about that too, huh? Shuuji: Huh? A-About what? Meguru: About why I decided to get a makeover when entering Himematsu. Shuuji: Well... Meguru: Yeah. Our conversation ended up there. Meguru: I didn't tell her anything. Shuuji: Huh? Meguru: It's a hard subject for me, so I just sorta glossed over it. Shuuji: ...... Meguru: But it makes me wonder if it's been weighing on her mind. And if it's been weighing on your mind as well... Shuuji: Umm...  Didn't you tell us before that you got a makeover to make yourself more approachable? Meguru: I did, and it's true, but I'm talking about what made me want to do that in the first place. Shuuji: O-Oh. Yeah... Meguru: ...... Meguru: Ah... Meguru: O-Okay. It's not a very enjoyable story, though... Ahaha... Shuuji: I don't mind. I'm just happy that you're willing to tell me. Meguru: ...Thank you. Shuuji: Alright. Go ahead. Meguru: She may have been my only one, but we were really close. We were best friends. Shuuji: ...You didn't have any other friends? Meguru: You know how clingy I can be, right? Well, back then, it was even worse. Meguru: I could be myself around Chi-chan, but not any of the other girls... Shuuji: Chi-chan, huh? Meguru: Yeah. Kizuki Chihoko. I always called her Chi-chan. Meguru: She was a very frail and quiet girl. She was a huge bookworm, though, and was super smart. Meguru: I did nothing but read books too, so we had a shared hobby and matching personalities. Meguru: I could tell her all the things that I couldn't tell anyone else. I told her everything... Meguru: ...But maybe that was the problem. Meguru: To make things worse, I tend to jabber on incessantly when I get excited. Meguru: Basically, I'm completely unfettered when it comes to everyone I'm close with... Shuuji: Yeah, I can see that. Meguru: ...... Meguru: Chi-chan stopped coming to school all of a sudden. Shuuji: Huh? Meguru: I had no idea why. She just stopped coming... Meguru: She never answered my calls or texts either. Meguru: After a while of that, I couldn't take it anymore and went over to her place. Meguru: But when I got there... her house was completely vacant. Shuuji: Huh...? Meguru: So I asked our homeroom teacher, but he wouldn't tell me anything. All he would say was that she left our school. Meguru: And now... I still have no idea where Chi-chan is or what she's currently doing... Shuuji: So... what you're saying is that she suddenly moved away and never told you? Meguru: She didn't tell me anything. She wouldn't even answer my texts or calls. Meguru: But I just figured that it made sense. Shuuji: ...Why's that? Meguru: I said something terrible to Chi-chan right before she stopped coming to school. Meguru: \"I can't get along with anyone else, but you're the only friend I want.\" Meguru: \"It's the same for you, right? So let's be friends forever.\" Shuuji: What's so terrible about that? Meguru: But when I think back on it now, I realize how put off she looked when I said that. Meguru: It was almost like I said something revolting to her... Shuuji: ...... Meguru: That's why I figured it must have been my fault that she didn't tell me anything. Meguru: Maybe it hurt her when I told her she didn't have any other friends than me. Meguru: I would say inconsiderate stuff like that and act like a selfish kid around her all the time. Maybe that was too much for her. Meguru: That must be why she disappeared from my life completely... Shuuji: But... Meguru: Partly because I lost my best friend... Meguru: But also, with Chi-chan gone, I was back to being without a single friend I could open up to. Shuuji: Ah... Meguru: So after that, I just became an introverted bookworm. Meguru: I knew I was too annoying to be good at making friends, so I was too scared to ever try again. Meguru: I also felt like I'd never get a friendship like Chi-chan's again, anyway. Meguru: And besides, not even my best friend Chi-chan wanted to be friends with me anymore. Shuuji: ...I see. Meguru: I decided I couldn't let things continue like that. Shuuji: ...... Meguru: I wanted to get good at socializing and tried my best to achieve that. Meguru: So if I were to meet Chi-chan again... I could apologize to her and tell her that I'm different now. Shuuji: ...And that's why you changed yourself when you entered Himematsu. Meguru: Yeah, exactly. Shuuji: I see... Meguru: ...I-I'm sorry. I just ended up spewing some boring, incomprehensible nonsense! Meguru: L-Let's talk about something else! Umm, err, like about MonHun― Shuuji: No. I get exactly how you feel. Shuuji: I've gone through some stuff and struggled to talk to people too. Shuuji: I've always had hardly any friends. The most I could ever muster was some smalltalk with my classmates. I would just wear a fake smile and try not to upset anyone. Shuuji: It got to the point where, just a little while back, my own dad told me I had the eyes of a dead fish. Meguru: Ah... Shuuji: Yeah, you've thought the same, I'm sure. Meguru: N-No! I would never think anything like that! I just thought you look kinda gloomy. Like you didn't have any friends and stuff... Shuuji: Yeah, that doesn't make it much better. Meguru: I'm sorry! Shuuji: It's alright. After all, it's the truth. Shuuji: But, you see, circumstances led me to joining the OC where I got in touch with everyone else's worries. That made me take a closer look at myself, which led to a thought. Meguru: Wh-Which is...? Shuuji: That I couldn't let things continue like that. Meguru: ...... Shuuji: I mean, I couldn't even muster a decent smile. It was so stiff that even I thought I looked gross. Shuuji: That inspired me to change myself. To give myself a more natural smile... Meguru: ...I see. Meguru: So you're... the same as me... Shuuji: Do you understand how I felt? Meguru: Y-Yeah! I totally do! It's almost like you were talking about me! Shuuji: Thanks. That is why I feel like I can understand your situation so well.   Shuuji: ...Thanks for telling me. Meguru: D-Don't thank me! I should thank you... Meguru: You told me about yourself, listened to my story and understood me. I'm so happy... Shuuji: Then that makes two of us. Meguru: Seems so... Ahahaha... Shuuji: ...... Meguru: ...... Shuuji: I-I guess it's about time we go home. Meguru: R-R-Right, we've been talking all evening... Meguru: Th-This is far enough. Meguru: Yeah. It's only a few minutes from here, and the streets are well-lit. Shuuji: Okay. Then I'll head home. See you on Monday, Inaba-san. Meguru: Yeah... Meguru: ...Oh, wait a moment! One last thing. Shuuji: Huh? What's up? Meguru: Umm... I don't know how to put this, but, umm... Meguru: I-I know you think you haven't been able to smile well... Shuuji: ...Huh? Meguru: But... Meguru: Your smile has never felt unpleasant to me! Shuuji: ...... Meguru: Y-Yeah... Hehe... Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Ready to have a taste of mine this time? Shuuji: Ahaha, yeah of course you― Meguru: But... Meguru: ...Can I ask for something else instead? Shuuji: What? L-Like, you want me to drink the rest of your cafe au lait or something? Meguru: ...... Shuuji: ...Inaba-san? Meguru: Meguru. Meguru: Could you, from today on... start calling me by my given name? Shuuji: ...... Meguru: ...... Meguru: N-Never mind! I take that back! Forget I said anything! Shuuji: M-Meguru. Meguru: Ah... Shuuji: Is that what you wanted? Meguru: A-Again. One more time. Shuuji: ...Meguru. Meguru: ～～～!! Shuuji: ...Hellooo Meguru. Meguru: That's me!

            "Touko: Good idea. Let's take a break, everyone. It's not good to strain yourself too much. Tsumugi: Nnngh! I'm so tired... Shuuji: Mh, nnngh... Touko: It's already this late? We must've been concentrating pretty hard. Shuuji: How about we talk about the party? Would make for a nice change of pace. Touko: That's a good idea. Nene: Then I'll go and make us some more tea. Tsumugi: Thanks, Ayachi-san. Shuuji: Hasn't it gotten a little bit dark in here? Meguru: Let's switch on the lights. Nene-senpai, is it okay to switch on the lights?  Nene: Yes, of course it is. I think I left the remote for the lights somewhere near the sofa.  Meguru: Roger that. Meguru: Remote, remote... Nene: You can't find it? Meguru: Give me a few seconds. Umm... Ah, found it. But... Huh? Shuuji: What's wrong? Meguru: ...It's a little different from the one at my home. It's smaller, and only has a few buttons. Shuuji: Wh-What are you holding there, Inaba-san?! Meguru: Well, the remote for the lights? Meguru: Alright, I'll turn on the lights now. Nene: Wait! Inaba-san! Please wait a moment! Meguru: Yeah? Why? Nene: You. Must. Not. Use. That. Switch! Meguru: Why are you talking like a robot? Nene: Who cares! That's not the right switch! It's for something else! You must not press it! Meguru: Oh, really? Then what's this remote for? It doesn't look like a remote for an air conditioner or TV. What is it? Nene: I-It's a remote detonator! Meguru: A remote detonator?! Nene: This room will explode if you press that button! You'd bomb us all! Meguru: Why would you have such a terrifying switch?! Shuuji: L-Look! O-Over here! Isn't this the remote for the lights?! Shuuji: I'll turn on the lights, so you can come back over here now. Meguru: Okay, thanks. Shuuji: Umm, Ayachi-san, here. Nene: ...Thank you, very much. Shuuji: Yeah, uh, don't worry about it. Shuuji: Anyway... Is this the remote for your egg― Nene: %130;Huh? What did you just say? Shuuji: You can't just keep pretending to be a dense anime protagonist whenever you're in trouble. Nene: God... I hate this. I'm going home... Shuuji: You ARE home. Nene: It's not like you think! It's, umm... for when the arousal sometimes comes on especially strongly... I-I don't use it every time! Shuuji: Uh, I never asked you about that. Calm down. Nene: I-It's all that stupid contract's fault! Shuuji: ...Yeah, okay. The contract. Nene: Yes, the contract. Shuuji: ...... Nene: ...... Nene: I can't take this anymore. This can't be happening. This can't be happening. This can't be happening... Death is the only way out now. Shuuji: Calm down. I haven't said anything. Nene: Your look... Your look says it all. It says that I'm a pervert for using an egg vibrator. Shuuji: I'm not thinking anything like that! Shuuji: Though, I WAS wondering why it was still out... Nene: I-It's not like you think! I'm not actually using it right now or anything! I'm not a pervert! Nene: I DID put it away! The egg itself, at least... But apparently I forgot the remote... Shuuji: So, there isn't anything else you forgot to put away, is there? We're all good now, right? Nene: Umm......... Nene: ........................... Nene: W-We're all good! Shuuji: It took you that long to think about it?! And why do you still sound so unsure?! Meguru: How far have you gotten so far? I don't know, since I've been studying the whole time. Nene: We have booked catering for light food, and we have ordered some inexpensive soft drinks over the internet. Nene: As for the party staff, we've discussed it with the Student Council and are currently making a shift plan. There should be no problems there. Nene: We also ordered the decorations on the internet when we ordered the drinks and got permission from the school to store them there upon delivery. Nene: Our overall plan has been to keep costs low by ordering through online stores that have good discounts. We'll only go out and buy the things we overlooked. Meguru: Ooh... Seems like most everything was taken care of while I wasn't paying attention. Touko: Just like I thought, Ayachi-san is very capable. She's so good at this that my help almost seems unnecessary. Nene: That's not true. I'm only able to be this efficient thanks to all the information you gave us. Nene: Except for the program. Meguru: Have we not made any progress there? Touko: We have. Our school's brass band will play at the party. Meguru: But that alone isn't enough? Nene: I wouldn't say that. But it's hard to tell until we actually hold the party. Touko: The party's main guests will be students, so we don't need anything super showy, but it's hard to tell how they'll feel until the party starts. Touko: At least we don't need a full stage schedule like with the cultural festival. Touko: But, just to be on the safe side, it would be better to have something that would fire everyone up with a whoomph.  Tsumugi: With a \"whoomph\"? Meguru: How about cavalry battle? Shuuji: That would certainly liven things up. If it were the sports festival. Meguru: A hotdog eating contest? Shuuji: Why do you keep bringing up typical sports festival events? Meguru: Then, what about a play? Touko: We did consider that. While it works for a cultural festival, wouldn't it be tiring to focus on the stage for too long at a party? Shuuji: Besides, we wouldn't be able to get the Drama Club to put together a show on such short notice. Nene: The third-years have already retired, so the club has their hands full practicing for next spring's cultural festival. Meguru: I see... Oh! Then how about embrace the Halloween theme and, like, do a candy exchange? Meguru: Everyone has to bring some candy, and then they exchange it with each other. Nene: Isn't exchanging sweets something you do on Christmas rather than Halloween? Shuuji: Giving out candy does fit Halloween... Though, that might be a bit daunting if participation is mandatory. Shuuji: Ideally, we want something everyone can participate in at their leisure, and still fun for those who don't participate... Hmmm... Shuuji: Oh, I know! How about a costume contest? Nene: A costume contest? Shuuji: You said that a lot of students wear Halloween costumes at the party, right? Touko: Yeah, a good number of them do every year. Tsumugi: So, you mean make it mandatory this time? Shuuji: No, that's too much to ask for. Shuuji: I'm talking about voting on who put the most effort into their costume, and who looks best in their costume. Meguru: You mean kinda like a beauty contest? Shuuji: Kinda, yeah. Shuuji: It doesn't have to be as grand, though. You'd need to submit your entry, but you wouldn't have to do anything special like presenting yourself on stage. Also, no separate brackets for girls and boys. Shuuji: And, hmm... As for the prizes, maybe something like school cafeteria meal tickets? We can fit that in our budget, right? Nene: Yes, we certainly do have the budget for that... Shuuji: If it's just casting a vote, everyone could participate no problem. Touko: Oh, yes, that's good. That would certainly liven things up. Tsumugi: If there's nothing weird like a swimsuit contest, I feel like a lot of students might participate. Shuuji: Well... I'm worried if we'll get enough participants, actually. Nene: Yeah, I know what you mean. The party could come around only for there to be no one willing to participate. Touko: You don't need to worry about that. There'll be at least five participants. Shuuji: Huh? Do you know anyone who'd participate? Touko: Yup. They're right here. Shuuji: Right here...? Wait, you mean... Shuuji: One...? Meguru: ...Two? Tsumugi: Three? Nene: Four... Touko: And five! Touko: See? We could at least stop the party from getting too awkward if we participate. Shuuji: Ahh, yeah. Touko: Not at all. You're very necessary. You need to show everyone that guys can participate too. Shuuji: Well, I guess that makes sense. Tsumugi: But that means that us five will definitely have to wear costumes, right? Meguru: More or less, yeah. Tsumugi: You... don't seem very bothered by it. Don't you think it's embarrassing? Or maybe you're an avid cosplayer? Meguru: No, it'll be my first time. I mean, it's a little embarrassing... But don't you think costumes will make the party more fun? Meguru: We'll have to help run the party the whole time anyway, so we might as well have fun with it. Tsumugi: Yeah... I guess. Meguru: Besides, it's not like you have to wear some kind of super sexy costume. Meguru: There'll be a lot of other people wearing costumes, so I think it'd be cool to give it a shot as well. Tsumugi: Well... Yeah, you might have a point. Shuuji: Do you not want to wear a costume, Shiiba-san? Tsumugi: I mean... It's not like I don't want to. It just seems like it'd be really embarrassing. Meguru: We'll be wearing costumes together, Tsumugi-senpai! You hardly ever get a chance like this! Tsumugi: ...... Tsumugi: ...A-As long as the costume isn't too revealing. Meguru: Of course. I don't want to dress in anything embarrassing, myself. Touko: Are you also alright with that, Ayachi-san? Nene: Well... If I don't have to wear anything weird that stands out too much, then I have no objections. Meguru: How are we going to get our costumes? Touko: Ah, leave that to me! I'll get costumes for all of us ready. Nene: Huh? But... Touko: Specifically, I want to ask the Fashion Design Club. So you all don't have to worry about your costumes. Tsumugi: Even if it's the Fashion Design Club, won't it be hard for them to prepare this many costumes on such short notice? Touko: It won't be a problem if I ask them now. I'm friends with the club president there, and she's is always talking about how much she likes making clothes for cute girls. Touko: I'm sure she would love to make costumes for you three. She would probably beg me for the honor and would hate me if I didn't ask her. Nene: Okay... Can you take care of that for us, then? Touko: Yup! You bet! Touko: My, this party is starting to sound so fun. Meguru: You said it! Let's make this the best party ever! Touko: Yeah! Nene: Well then, Inaba-san, we better get back to studying so you can actually attend that party. Meguru: Ugh... I'd rather not be reminded... Nene: We were quite productive today, I'd say. Touko: Yeah, we sure were. That was a great study session! Meguru: My head hurts a little from all the concentrating. Nene: Today would be all for naught if you end up forgetting everything. Make sure you review everything if you want it to stick. Meguru: Ugh... I know. Tsumugi: Ayachi-san, thanks for letting us use your apartment. Nene: Don't thank me. I really enjoyed studying together with everyone. Tsumugi: Yeah, I had a ton of fun too! Shuuji: Thanks for helping me study today. Nene: You're very welcome. Usually it's always you helping me out. Touko: Well, Inaba-san, think you can pass your tests now? Meguru: It's hard to say, but... I'll make sure not to waste Nene-senpai's lessons! Nene: I'm hoping for some good results, Inaba-san. Meguru: Y-Yeah... I'll do my best. Shuuji: Anyway, we shouldn't stand around here chatting forever, so... Tsumugi: Right. See you all on Monday, then. Meguru: Thank you for today, Nene-senpai. Touko: Thanks for having us. Shuuji: Have a nice weekend, Ayachi-san. Nene: Thank you. You too. Touko: I need to take the train, so I'm heading this way. Bye-bye. Meguru: See you. Tsumugi: Thanks for all the help today. Touko: Let's try our best to pass our tests too! Until next week. Shuuji: Yeah, see you at school. Enjoy the rest of your weekend. Shuuji: Alright, you both live in the same direction, right? I've already come this far, so I may as well see you two home. Meguru: You don't have to. My place is just around the corner, and Tsumugi-senpai is with me too. We'll be just fine. Tsumugi: Yeah. I'm happy you want to see us home, but don't you live in the other direction? You've already gone out your way for us enough. There's no need to go even more out of the way. Meguru: Okay, so we'll go the rest of the way alone. Bye! Today was a lot of fun. Tsumugi: It really was. Have a nice weekend. Bye-bye. Shuuji: You too. See you two on Monday. Shuuji: ...Welp, time for me to go home as well. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Man, I really am acting strange. I've never really cared about a school event before. Wakana: ...Oh, Hoshina? Shuuji: Kariya? What are you doing here? Wakana: I'm going home from guitar practice. Shuuji: Out practicing this close to midterms, huh? Wakana: Well, you know, I just needed a change of pace. Hahaha... *sigh* Wakana: As if! I'm not brave enough for that. I'm renting a rehearsal studio. Shuuji: Can you do that by yourself? I always figured that was something only bands could do. Wakana: Rehearsal studios come in all shapes and forms. A lot of places rent out small studios for solo practice. That's the kind I'm renting. Wakana: I've got some cash to play around with thanks to my job at the cafe, so sometimes I rent out a rehearsal studio where I can go all out with an amp. Shuuji: You don't do street performance? Wakana: Oh, please. I'm really not brave enough for that. And it seems like it'd be a real pain in the butt. Shuuji: Then how about forming a band? Wakana: I'm just a hobbyist. I mean, sure, I'm getting some decent practice in now that I bought my own guitar, but still. Shuuji: You've been at this for a while, though. It's been a few years, right? Wakana: Well, yeah. It has. Shuuji: Hmm... Shuuji: How about testing the waters a little? Wakana: Huh? What are you talking about? Shuuji: Want to try showing off your guitar skills in front of some fellow students? Wakana: Some fellow students...? What do you mean by that? What're you talking about? "

Let's take a break, everyone. It's not good to strain yourself too much. Tsumugi: Nnngh! I'm so tired... Shuuji: Mh, nnngh... Touko: It's already this late? We must've been concentrating pretty hard. Shuuji: How about we talk about the party? Would make for a nice change of pace. Touko: That's a good idea. Nene: Then I'll go and make us some more tea. Tsumugi: Thanks, Ayachi-san. Shuuji: Hasn't it gotten a little bit dark in here? Meguru: Let's switch on the lights. Nene-senpai, is it okay to switch on the lights?  Nene: Yes, of course it is. I think I left the remote for the lights somewhere near the sofa.  Meguru: Roger that. Meguru: Remote, remote... Nene: You can't find it? Meguru: Give me a few seconds. Umm... Ah, found it. But... Huh? Shuuji: What's wrong? Meguru: ...It's a little different from the one at my home. It's smaller, and only has a few buttons. Shuuji: Wh-What are you holding there, Inaba-san?! Meguru: Well, the remote for the lights? Meguru: Alright, I'll turn on the lights now. Nene: Wait! Inaba-san! Please wait a moment! Meguru: Yeah? Why? Nene: You. Must. Not. Use. That. Switch! Meguru: Why are you talking like a robot? Nene: Who cares! That's not the right switch! It's for something else! You must not press it! Meguru: Oh, really? Then what's this remote for? It doesn't look like a remote for an air conditioner or TV. What is it? Nene: I-It's a remote detonator! Meguru: A remote detonator?! Nene: This room will explode if you press that button! You'd bomb us all! Meguru: Why would you have such a terrifying switch?! Shuuji: L-Look! O-Over here! Isn't this the remote for the lights?! Shuuji: I'll turn on the lights, so you can come back over here now. Meguru: Okay, thanks. Shuuji: Umm, Ayachi-san, here. Nene: ...Thank you, very much. Shuuji: Yeah, uh, don't worry about it. Shuuji: Anyway... Is this the remote for your egg― Nene: %130;Huh? What did you just say? Shuuji: You can't just keep pretending to be a dense anime protagonist whenever you're in trouble. Nene: God... I hate this. I'm going home... Shuuji: You ARE home. Nene: It's not like you think! It's, umm... for when the arousal sometimes comes on especially strongly... I-I don't use it every time! Shuuji: Uh, I never asked you about that. Calm down. Nene: I-It's all that stupid contract's fault! Shuuji: ...Yeah, okay. The contract. Nene: Yes, the contract. Shuuji: ...... Nene: ...... Nene: I can't take this anymore. This can't be happening. This can't be happening. This can't be happening... Death is the only way out now. Shuuji: Calm down. I haven't said anything. Nene: Your look... Your look says it all. It says that I'm a pervert for using an egg vibrator. Shuuji: I'm not thinking anything like that! Shuuji: Though, I WAS wondering why it was still out... Nene: I-It's not like you think! I'm not actually using it right now or anything! I'm not a pervert! Nene: I DID put it away! The egg itself, at least... But apparently I forgot the remote... Shuuji: So, there isn't anything else you forgot to put away, is there? We're all good now, right? Nene: Umm......... Nene: ........................... Nene: W-We're all good! Shuuji: It took you that long to think about it?! And why do you still sound so unsure?! Meguru: How far have you gotten so far? I don't know, since I've been studying the whole time. Nene: We have booked catering for light food, and we have ordered some inexpensive soft drinks over the internet. Nene: As for the party staff, we've discussed it with the Student Council and are currently making a shift plan. There should be no problems there. Nene: We also ordered the decorations on the internet when we ordered the drinks and got permission from the school to store them there upon delivery. Nene: Our overall plan has been to keep costs low by ordering through online stores that have good discounts. We'll only go out and buy the things we overlooked. Meguru: Ooh... Seems like most everything was taken care of while I wasn't paying attention. Touko: Just like I thought, Ayachi-san is very capable. She's so good at this that my help almost seems unnecessary. Nene: That's not true. I'm only able to be this efficient thanks to all the information you gave us. Nene: Except for the program. Meguru: Have we not made any progress there? Touko: We have. Our school's brass band will play at the party. Meguru: But that alone isn't enough? Nene: I wouldn't say that. But it's hard to tell until we actually hold the party. Touko: The party's main guests will be students, so we don't need anything super showy, but it's hard to tell how they'll feel until the party starts. Touko: At least we don't need a full stage schedule like with the cultural festival. Touko: But, just to be on the safe side, it would be better to have something that would fire everyone up with a whoomph.  Tsumugi: With a \"whoomph\"? Meguru: How about cavalry battle? Shuuji: That would certainly liven things up. If it were the sports festival. Meguru: A hotdog eating contest? Shuuji: Why do you keep bringing up typical sports festival events? Meguru: Then, what about a play? Touko: We did consider that. While it works for a cultural festival, wouldn't it be tiring to focus on the stage for too long at a party? Shuuji: Besides, we wouldn't be able to get the Drama Club to put together a show on such short notice. Nene: The third-years have already retired, so the club has their hands full practicing for next spring's cultural festival. Meguru: I see... Oh! Then how about embrace the Halloween theme and, like, do a candy exchange? Meguru: Everyone has to bring some candy, and then they exchange it with each other. Nene: Isn't exchanging sweets something you do on Christmas rather than Halloween? Shuuji: Giving out candy does fit Halloween... Though, that might be a bit daunting if participation is mandatory. Shuuji: Ideally, we want something everyone can participate in at their leisure, and still fun for those who don't participate... Hmmm... Shuuji: Oh, I know! How about a costume contest? Nene: A costume contest? Shuuji: You said that a lot of students wear Halloween costumes at the party, right? Touko: Yeah, a good number of them do every year. Tsumugi: So, you mean make it mandatory this time? Shuuji: No, that's too much to ask for. Shuuji: I'm talking about voting on who put the most effort into their costume, and who looks best in their costume. Meguru: You mean kinda like a beauty contest? Shuuji: Kinda, yeah. Shuuji: It doesn't have to be as grand, though. You'd need to submit your entry, but you wouldn't have to do anything special like presenting yourself on stage. Also, no separate brackets for girls and boys. Shuuji: And, hmm... As for the prizes, maybe something like school cafeteria meal tickets? We can fit that in our budget, right? Nene: Yes, we certainly do have the budget for that... Shuuji: If it's just casting a vote, everyone could participate no problem. Touko: Oh, yes, that's good. That would certainly liven things up. Tsumugi: If there's nothing weird like a swimsuit contest, I feel like a lot of students might participate. Shuuji: Well... I'm worried if we'll get enough participants, actually. Nene: Yeah, I know what you mean. The party could come around only for there to be no one willing to participate. Touko: You don't need to worry about that. There'll be at least five participants. Shuuji: Huh? Do you know anyone who'd participate? Touko: Yup. They're right here. Shuuji: Right here...? Wait, you mean... Shuuji: One...? Meguru: ...Two? Tsumugi: Three? Nene: Four... Touko: And five! Touko: See? We could at least stop the party from getting too awkward if we participate. Shuuji: Ahh, yeah. Touko: Not at all. You're very necessary. You need to show everyone that guys can participate too. Shuuji: Well, I guess that makes sense. Tsumugi: But that means that us five will definitely have to wear costumes, right? Meguru: More or less, yeah. Tsumugi: You... don't seem very bothered by it. Don't you think it's embarrassing? Or maybe you're an avid cosplayer? Meguru: No, it'll be my first time. I mean, it's a little embarrassing... But don't you think costumes will make the party more fun? Meguru: We'll have to help run the party the whole time anyway, so we might as well have fun with it. Tsumugi: Yeah... I guess. Meguru: Besides, it's not like you have to wear some kind of super sexy costume. Meguru: There'll be a lot of other people wearing costumes, so I think it'd be cool to give it a shot as well. Tsumugi: Well... Yeah, you might have a point. Shuuji: Do you not want to wear a costume, Shiiba-san? Tsumugi: I mean... It's not like I don't want to. It just seems like it'd be really embarrassing. Meguru: We'll be wearing costumes together, Tsumugi-senpai! You hardly ever get a chance like this! Tsumugi: ...... Tsumugi: ...A-As long as the costume isn't too revealing. Meguru: Of course. I don't want to dress in anything embarrassing, myself. Touko: Are you also alright with that, Ayachi-san? Nene: Well... If I don't have to wear anything weird that stands out too much, then I have no objections. Meguru: How are we going to get our costumes? Touko: Ah, leave that to me! I'll get costumes for all of us ready. Nene: Huh? But... Touko: Specifically, I want to ask the Fashion Design Club. So you all don't have to worry about your costumes. Tsumugi: Even if it's the Fashion Design Club, won't it be hard for them to prepare this many costumes on such short notice? Touko: It won't be a problem if I ask them now. I'm friends with the club president there, and she's is always talking about how much she likes making clothes for cute girls. Touko: I'm sure she would love to make costumes for you three. She would probably beg me for the honor and would hate me if I didn't ask her. Nene: Okay... Can you take care of that for us, then? Touko: Yup! You bet! Touko: My, this party is starting to sound so fun. Meguru: You said it! Let's make this the best party ever! Touko: Yeah! Nene: Well then, Inaba-san, we better get back to studying so you can actually attend that party. Meguru: Ugh... I'd rather not be reminded... Nene: We were quite productive today, I'd say. Touko: Yeah, we sure were. That was a great study session! Meguru: My head hurts a little from all the concentrating. Nene: Today would be all for naught if you end up forgetting everything. Make sure you review everything if you want it to stick. Meguru: Ugh... I know. Tsumugi: Ayachi-san, thanks for letting us use your apartment. Nene: Don't thank me. I really enjoyed studying together with everyone. Tsumugi: Yeah, I had a ton of fun too! Shuuji: Thanks for helping me study today. Nene: You're very welcome. Usually it's always you helping me out. Touko: Well, Inaba-san, think you can pass your tests now? Meguru: It's hard to say, but... I'll make sure not to waste Nene-senpai's lessons! Nene: I'm hoping for some good results, Inaba-san. Meguru: Y-Yeah... I'll do my best. Shuuji: Anyway, we shouldn't stand around here chatting forever, so... Tsumugi: Right. See you all on Monday, then. Meguru: Thank you for today, Nene-senpai. Touko: Thanks for having us. Shuuji: Have a nice weekend, Ayachi-san. Nene: Thank you. You too. Touko: I need to take the train, so I'm heading this way. Bye-bye. Meguru: See you. Tsumugi: Thanks for all the help today. Touko: Let's try our best to pass our tests too! Until next week. Shuuji: Yeah, see you at school. Enjoy the rest of your weekend. Shuuji: Alright, you both live in the same direction, right? I've already come this far, so I may as well see you two home. Meguru: You don't have to. My place is just around the corner, and Tsumugi-senpai is with me too. We'll be just fine. Tsumugi: Yeah. I'm happy you want to see us home, but don't you live in the other direction? You've already gone out your way for us enough. There's no need to go even more out of the way. Meguru: Okay, so we'll go the rest of the way alone. Bye! Today was a lot of fun. Tsumugi: It really was. Have a nice weekend. Bye-bye. Shuuji: You too. See you two on Monday. Shuuji: ...Welp, time for me to go home as well. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Man, I really am acting strange. I've never really cared about a school event before. Wakana: ...Oh, Hoshina? Shuuji: Kariya? What are you doing here? Wakana: I'm going home from guitar practice. Shuuji: Out practicing this close to midterms, huh? Wakana: Well, you know, I just needed a change of pace. Hahaha... *sigh* Wakana: As if! I'm not brave enough for that. I'm renting a rehearsal studio. Shuuji: Can you do that by yourself? I always figured that was something only bands could do. Wakana: Rehearsal studios come in all shapes and forms. A lot of places rent out small studios for solo practice. That's the kind I'm renting. Wakana: I've got some cash to play around with thanks to my job at the cafe, so sometimes I rent out a rehearsal studio where I can go all out with an amp. Shuuji: You don't do street performance? Wakana: Oh, please. I'm really not brave enough for that. And it seems like it'd be a real pain in the butt. Shuuji: Then how about forming a band? Wakana: I'm just a hobbyist. I mean, sure, I'm getting some decent practice in now that I bought my own guitar, but still. Shuuji: You've been at this for a while, though. It's been a few years, right? Wakana: Well, yeah. It has. Shuuji: Hmm... Shuuji: How about testing the waters a little? Wakana: Huh? What are you talking about? Shuuji: Want to try showing off your guitar skills in front of some fellow students? Wakana: Some fellow students...? What do you mean by that? What're you talking about? \n\nWhile these examples may provide some guidance, evaluate their relevance to the current conversation.

Shuuji: I'm not used to stuff like this... Go easy on me, please. Touko: Okay, my bad. Well, it's getting late, so how about we start locking up? Shuuji: Yeah, let's. Shuuji: But, before that... Could I have a moment? Touko: Of course. There's no rush. Oh, have you decided to talk to me at last? Shuuji: It's more of a request, I guess? Touko: You need something from me? Touko: Oh, is this about your reward? Decided what you wanted, have you? Go on then, let's hear it. Touko: Please, be honest with me. How can I be of service?

Oh my, you naughty boy. Shuuji: Could you please cut it out with the dirty jokes? Shuuji: I don't want any kind of special conversation. Certainly not one about sex. I just want us to talk normally so I can learn more about you. Shuuji: I mean, yes, there is a reason I want to talk to you, but we don't have to talk about anything specific... A normal conversation will do just fine, really. Touko: You're really serious about this. My bad. I just went and poked fun at you like normal. Shuuji: No, it's fine. I mean, I know this is a bit out of the blue. Touko: What's this about, though? Why do you want to know more about me? Shuuji: Well, you see, errm... There's no big reason behind it. Shuuji: It's just, we're in the same club, but I barely know anything about you. When I realized that, it started to bother me and made me want to do something about it. Touko: Oh, I see. Shuuji: So I just thought we could hang out together a little, or something. Shuuji: So... is that a no, then? Touko: Chatting itself isn't a problem. I don't mind doing that. Shuuji: Oh, well, that's good... Touko: Well, chatting a little isn't much of a reward, is it? It's just a normal, everyday thing. Touko: So it doesn't feel right. Hmm... Oh, I know. Let's go somewhere on our next day off, just the two of us, and talk there. Shuuji: Huh? Just the two of us? Touko: Yeah, that's right. That'll make it nice and easy for us to talk, won't it? Shuuji: D-Do you mean like... Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Yeah, sounds great. Touko: It's settled, then! Your reward for doing a good job with the Halloween party is a date with me. I sound a bit arrogant, putting it that way. Ahaha. Shuuji: N-No, I don't think you did at all. Thank you very much, Senpai. Touko: No problem. Well then, I'm looking forward to our date. Shuuji: I-I'm looking forward to it too. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: A date with Togakushi-senpai... Shuuji: A date... A date, huh? Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Do I even have any good date clothes?! Hideaki: Yo! Shuuji: Hey. Hideaki: What're you doing here so early? Shuuji: Just thinking about things. Hideaki: If something's bothering you, why not go talk to your friends at the OC? Shuuji: If it was a normal problem, I would. Shuuji: But this is a matter of pride. I can't talk to girls about this. Hideaki: Oho. This sounds interesting―no, I dare say fascinating. Hideaki: Well, we're both men here. You can talk to me about it! Shuuji: Huh? With you? Kaidou...? Hideaki: What's with that reaction? Don't talk smack until you try! I mean, the drum thing worked out, didn't it? Shuuji: That's true. Shuuji: You're being awfully nice today. Hideaki: That's 'cause it looks like something's really bothering you. And now I wanna know what it is. Shuuji: You're really enjoying this, huh? Hideaki: Kinda? But I'm pretty worried too. I'm not gonna laugh at you, I swear. I'll just give you my opinion. Shuuji: The whole reason I'm hesitant is that I know you'll laugh at me. Hideaki: A date, huh? I see, hmm... Hideaki: ...... Hideaki: Pfft, ahahahaha! Even middle schoolers don't worry about that nowadays! Ahahahaha! Shuuji: I thought you weren't gonna laugh! Hideaki: Sorry, my bad. Couldn't help it. Just didn't expect you to be worrying about a date. Shuuji: I think a lot of people worry about dates, actually. Hideaki: I went out and bought new clothes and everything for it. But I was wearing stuff I wasn't used to, so it went horribly. Shuuji: So, do you think I should dress up properly for a date? Hideaki: I dunno. Like, obviously you have to pay attention to your looks, but... I don't think you need to dress fancy or anything. Hideaki: Especially in your case, Shuuji. It's not like you're going on an actual date, right? So the rules for a normal date don't apply. Shuuji: Yeah... You're right. "

Schoolgirl D: Ayachi-san! Let's start a band together! With your heavenly voice, we'll make it big for sure! Nene: Sorry, but I'm not interested. I was just a stand-in for that one occasion. Schoolgirl D: But didn't the crowd's reaction feel great? Don't you wanna get more of that, on an even bigger stage? I know you can do it, Ayachi-san! Nene: Thank you for the compliment, but I really can't. I'm not good at being in front of crowds. Schoolgirl D: *sigh* Okay, I guess there's no changing your mind. Aww man, we could've hit it big... Schoolgirl D: Oh! But if you ever change your mind and wanna step onto the stage again, talk to me first! You gotta! Nene: *sigh* Very well. Touko: You had it tough today. Here's some tea. Drink it and let it calm your soul. Watch out, though; it's hot. Nene: Thank you, Togakushi-senpai. Nene: *blow* *sip* Ahh, wonderful... Tsumugi: And there were even more people who asked her in our classroom. Meguru: Really? Whoa, that's crazy... Nene: I'm glad that they liked my singing... I just wish they would leave me be. Touko: Now, now, this just shows how wonderfully your band played, doesn't it? Nene: Yes, and that's an honor, and I'm truly grateful, but... it's rather draining... Shuuji: In fact, I'm sure it'll be a lot calmer tomorrow, even. The party is still fresh in everyone's minds. Nene: I hope you're right... Meguru: Should we wrap things up here, then? Nene-senpai's looking pretty rough. Tsumugi: They'll be closing the club building soon, so I doubt anyone else is gonna come to us with their problems. Shuuji: There you have it, Ayachi-san. Let's call it a day so you can take it easy. Nene: ...Very well. Thank you for looking out for me. Touko: Helping people is important, but you're not going to be able to help anyone if you get sick. Touko: I'll take over tidying and locking up, so you can go straight home. Nene: ...Are you sure? Touko: Yup, just leave it to me! Nene: Well then, I'll be excusing myself. Thank you, everyone. Touko: Bye-bye～ Make sure you get some rest! Tsumugi: Wait up! I'll go home with you, just in case. Meguru: Oh, I'll come too. What about you, Senpai? Shuuji: I feel bad making Togakushi-senpai tidy up by herself, so I'll stay and help her out. Tsumugi: Bye, then. Shuuji: Yeah, see you later. Touko: See you tomorrow～ Shuuji: ...... Touko: Oh my, what do you mean? I only made a simple observation. Shuuji: You know what you said, and you clearly did it on purpose. Touko: Mufufu. You're blushing, you know? Shuuji: I'm not used to stuff like this... Go easy on me, please. Touko: Okay, my bad. Well, it's getting late, so how about we start locking up? Shuuji: Yeah, let's. Shuuji: But, before that... Could I have a moment? Touko: Of course. There's no rush. Oh, have you decided to talk to me at last? Shuuji: It's more of a request, I guess? Touko: You need something from me? Touko: Oh, is this about your reward? Decided what you wanted, have you? Go on then, let's hear it. Touko: Please, be honest with me. How can I be of service? Shuuji: I'd just like to talk for a minute if you don't mind. Touko: You want to talk? But isn't that what we're doing right now? Or do you mean you want to talk about sex? Like pillow talk? Oh my, you naughty boy. Shuuji: Could you please cut it out with the dirty jokes? Shuuji: I don't want any kind of special conversation. Certainly not one about sex. I just want us to talk normally so I can learn more about you. Shuuji: I mean, yes, there is a reason I want to talk to you, but we don't have to talk about anything specific... A normal conversation will do just fine, really. Touko: You're really serious about this. My bad. I just went and poked fun at you like normal. Shuuji: No, it's fine. I mean, I know this is a bit out of the blue. Touko: What's this about, though? Why do you want to know more about me? Shuuji: Well, you see, errm... There's no big reason behind it.

Shuuji: The whole reason I'm hesitant is that I know you'll laugh at me. Hideaki: A date, huh? I see, hmm... Hideaki: ...... Hideaki: Pfft, ahahahaha! Even middle schoolers don't worry about that nowadays! Ahahahaha! Shuuji: I thought you weren't gonna laugh! Hideaki: Sorry, my bad. Couldn't help it. Just didn't expect you to be worrying about a date. Shuuji: I think a lot of people worry about dates, actually. Hideaki: I went out and bought new clothes and everything for it. But I was wearing stuff I wasn't used to, so it went horribly. Shuuji: So, do you think I should dress up properly for a date? Hideaki: I dunno. Like, obviously you have to pay attention to your looks, but... I don't think you need to dress fancy or anything. Hideaki: Especially in your case, Shuuji. It's not like you're going on an actual date, right? So the rules for a normal date don't apply. Shuuji: Yeah... You're right. \n\nWhile these examples may provide some guidance, evaluate their relevance to the current conversation.

Ayachi-san was busy all day dealing with everyone stopping by. Meguru: Nene-senpai, do you think we could just get one quest in together? Nene: I'm sorry, but I really don't feel like playing games after all that... Nene: Besides... Nene: I-It's just you. Right, Hoshina-kun? Shuuji: Yeah, don't be silly. C'mon, you'll get left behind if you don't hurry up. Meguru: ...Hey, don't just gloss over my question like that. Shuuji: We're not glossing over anything. Anyway, where's my bag? Meguru: ...... Meguru: (Is there something going on between them? This is kinda frustrating...) Touko: Okay, I have plans to see a friend now. See you all tomorrow. Tsumugi: Yeah, bye. Tsumugi: How about we all go somewhere too? Or maybe it would be better to go straight home today, huh? Nene: Yes... I would appreciate that. Tsumugi: That's fine! Get plenty of rest. Meguru: ...... Shuuji: Hm? Inaba-san, what's wrong? You don't wanna go home? Meguru: ...Senpai. Meguru: Come with me for a bit! Shuuji: Wha?! Nene: Ah, okay... Meguru: I need to talk to you! Meguru: Oh, our hands... Shuuji: You're just now realizing that? Meguru: Y-Yeah. I just kinda grabbed your hand without thinking. Sorry! Shuuji: It's not like I mind... Shuuji: Umm... So what do you want to talk about? Meguru: Oh, r-right! About that, umm... Shuuji: What? Meguru: I mean y-you're unfair! Meguru: I wanna get along with Nene-senpai too! Shuuji: ...What? Meguru: It feels like you been talking to each other behind everyone's backs! Meguru: You've been talking with THE Nene-senpai! She's cute, pretty, has a great figure, is classy but nice... but she still keeps everyone at a distance. Everyone but you, it seems! Meguru: That's so not fair! Meguru: N-No, I wouldn't go that far. I'd feel bad asking about that... Shuuji: Yeah? Meguru: Senpai, how have you gotten so close with Nene-senpai? Shuuji: Right, umm... Shuuji: Hmm... If you wanna be better friends with her, shouldn't you have gone home with her instead of dragging me off somewhere? Meguru: W-Well yeah, I guess, but... Shuuji: Though, if it were that easy, we wouldn't be here right now. Meguru: Y-Yeah! Right! Shuuji: But you know, the way I see it is that you're the one who's closer to Ayachi-san. Shuuji: It's not like I can hug Ayachi-san like you do. Meguru: Well, no duh! Guys can't just hug girls out of nowhere! That'd be so wrong! Shuuji: Can't exactly say no to that. Ayachi-san is pretty hot... Meguru: Ugh... You're such a creeper sometimes. Seriously, how can you say that? Shuuji: You're the one who asked me that! Any guy would feel the same way. It's not like we act on every urge we get! Meguru: Looking at it the other way around, all I can do is hug her and nothing else. Shuuji: What do you mean by that? Meguru: W-Well, you know... We never chat alone in the clubroom during lunch break, for example. Shuuji: So that really has been weighing on your mind... We didn't talk about anything special there, okay? Meguru: Th-That doesn't make it any less unfair. I'm still just as jealous knowing that! Meguru: Remember what I said yesterday? I just want all of my friendships to be deep. That's why! Shuuji: Hmm... Meguru: But like I just mentioned, Nene-senpai always seems kinda distant, you know? So it's hard to just up and ask her. Meguru: What if she went all, \"You want me to eat lunch with you? Why would I do that?\" I'd die from shock. Shuuji: ...Yeah, that's tough. Shuuji: Okay. I'll do what I can. Meguru: ...!! Shuuji: Err, I think it's a bit early to be thanking me. Meguru: Whatcha mean? Shuuji: While I'd love to help you, I'm not actually sure how I got so close to Ayachi-san. Shuuji: So I don't have a clue where to start. Meguru: What?! Meguru: Th-That's not true! You're like super close! You've even been communicating with eye contact alone! Meguru: That's the whole reason I said this is unfair! Shuuji: Well, I'm glad you think so, but I dunno what to do... Shuuji: Like you said earlier, there's an inherent difference in how we can interact with her since I'm a guy and you're a girl. I doubt my approach would work for you. Meguru: You got close with her in a way only a guy can...? Meguru: W-Wait! Is that why you understand each other so well?! I mean, like, your relationship has gotten ph-ph-physical?! Shuuji: Whoa, whoa! Hold on! You're way off-base! Why are you taking things in that direction?! Meguru: Don't put this on me! You're the one who made it sound like that! Shuuji: I didn't! That was all you! Anyway, just calm down. Let's get some drinks at the vending machine over there. Shuuji: That's what I want to say... *sip* Anyway, that was just a misunderstanding on your part.  Meguru: Yeah, I know. There's no way that'd be true now that I think about it. Shuuji: Would've been nice if you thought that through sooner... Would have saved me some money on the drinks. Meguru: Ah, speaking of, is the milk tea you got any good? I had a hard time deciding between that and this coffee. Shuuji: I'd say it's better than the kind they have at school. Meguru: Hmm... Maybe I should've went with the milk tea instead. Shuuji: Want a taste? Meguru: Of course not! That would be an... i-i-indirect kiss! Shuuji: Oh... Y-Yeah, I guess so. Meguru: Geez, why are you always like this? There's no way a dolt like you could get close with Nene-senpai! Shuuji: Isn't that different from what you said earlier? Meguru: ...So please tell me how you got so close to her while being such a dolt. Shuuji: Err, like I said, I have no idea. Meguru: You are no help at all... Shuuji: Oh, give me a break. Let me think... Meguru: I won't drink that even if you wipe the rim clean. Shuuji: Forget about that already. What I'm saying is... Shuuji: Why not just go and visit Ayachi-san right now? Meguru: ...... Shuuji: And then when you're there, suggest staying the night. Meguru: ...Y-You mean, just me? Shuuji: Of course. You want to get closer to her, right? Meguru: N-No way! Shuuji: You mean you don't want to get closer to her?! Meguru: No, I do! But you want me to stay the night with her?! Meguru: Visiting her by myself would be hard enough for me... Shuuji: And yet you have no qualms hanging out at my place... Meguru: Th-That's because it's you. Meguru: R-Right. Meguru: But, umm, the idea itself is good. Sleeping over at Nene-senpai's place is like a dream for me. Shuuji: Okay, then with that goal in mind, how about you work towards getting closer to her starting tomorrow? Meguru: Ugh... Can I really do this? Shuuji: Well, how about you come and stay over at my place as practice? Meguru: AS IF!! Shuuji: Well, with that settled, let's pick this back up tomorrow. Meguru: O-Okay. See you tomorrow. Meguru: Umm... Thank you, Senpai. Shuuji: You can show your thanks by staying the night at my place. Meguru: What?! Are you serious?! Are you in super-perv Senpai mode right now?! Are you after me or something?! Shuuji: Nah, just kidding. Meguru: You've got a real messed up sense of humor... Taichi: Okay. Take care. Shuuji: ...Good morning. Meguru: Yeah! I figured you'd eventually pass by here. Shuuji: ...Why, though? Meguru: Hey! What kind of reaction is that? Meguru: Didn't you tell me you'd help me yesterday? Shuuji: Oh yeah, I guess that makes sense... Shuuji: Sorry. I was just a little taken aback. Meguru: ...Senpai? Shuuji: Oh, it's nothing. Let's walk while we talk. Meguru: Yeah! Roger that. Shuuji: We'll end up at school in no time if we follow my regular route though. Shuuji: So at the risk of sounding boring, let's take the same detour as yesterday. Shuuji: Should we not have taken a detour? Meguru: No, that was actually a good idea. Meguru: ...It just feels strange heading to school with you. Shuuji: Even though you were waiting to ambush me... Meguru: I-I know. And did you have to put it like that? You make me sound like a bad guy! Shuuji: Anyway, if you have no problem with the detour, then let's get down to business. Shuuji: We need to talk about how you should get closer to Ayachi-san. Meguru: Y-Yeah. Shuuji: So, to make sure, is the goal still being able to sleep over at her place? Meguru: Yeah, we can go with that. Meguru: I kinda got really flustered yesterday, but after thinking about it calmly, it doesn't seem too hard to do. Shuuji: If it's that easy, then can't you do this without my help? Meguru: Th-That's not how I meant it! You can't back out now! You already promised me you'd help! Meguru: Good! Meguru: You know, for how cold you seem, you're surprisingly nice. Shuuji: How am I supposed to take that? Meguru: As a compliment. Shuuji: O-Okay, thanks... Anyhow... Shuuji: The way I see it, getting used to interacting with her is the only way. Meguru: Right. I agree with that. Shuuji: And so, your first step should be― Meguru: Ne... N-N-Nene-senpai! Meguru: Good mornifsh! Nene: It's unusual to see you here in the morning. Meguru: Y-Yesh. Tru dat! Nene: ......?? Meguru: Not at all! Just saying good morninf! Meguru: Hoshina-senpai invited me, so I figured I would swing by... Nene: Okay...? Meguru: Helloha! Nene: ...Yes. Helloha to you as well. Meguru: ...... Nene: ...... "

Nene: I appreciate your kind words, I do... but I'm really sorry. I have no intention of singing any further. Schoolgirl D: Man, that's a bummer... I was ready to be a star.  Schoolgirl D: But if you ever change your mind, I'm always up for it! I'll wait for you, no matter how long it takes! Nene: U-Uhm, yes... Thank you.  Touko: Here, have some tea. I imagine you must be pretty exhausted.  Nene: Thank you, Togakushi-senpai. Touko: The only thing at home I can do is study, and doing that all day just turns my brain to mush. I'm sure you know that feeling.  Touko: So, if you guys don't mind, would it be alright if I stayed and helped the OC out?  Tsumugi: Only if you count the clubroom. If you count all the people that asked her in the classroom during school, it's way more than three.  Nene: It has been quite the day... Shuuji: ...Definitely. I can tell that just by looking at you.

I'll just tell them that the Occult Club is going to be doing a performance.  Shuuji: Let's hope that's enough to dissuade them.  Tsumugi: No need to worry about it now, you have time. A lot of things can change in a year, so you might as well just worry about it when the time comes.  Shuuji: True. We can't really make predictions about events that far off in the future.  Nene: Still... Just thinking about the possibility is enough to make me depressed... *sigh* Touko: How long do you guys usually stay?  Nene: It can vary depending on things, but generally, I would say we leave around six.  Shuuji: Do you wanna just call it a day now? We can do that. I know several of the sports teams end around this time too.  Touko: Good idea. I imagine Ayachi-san wants to go on home and lay down.  Meguru: We don't have to stay if you don't want to, Nene-senpai. Tsumugi: And don't forget, this is a weekday. Don't you want to be well-rested for school tomorrow? Nene: Okay...

I got the milk, and I got the kinpira burdock. Clerk: Alright, here you are! That'll be 605 Yen. Shuuji: Here.  Clerk: 605 exactly. Thank you, thank you. Please come see us again. Shuuji: Phew, NOW I'm done. Time to go on home and get some din?Hm? Nene: ...... Nene: Huh? Ah, hello, Hoshina-kun! What are you doing here? Shuuji: Nothing much. Just doing some shopping before dinner. What're you up to?  Shuuji: I noticed you pacing around for some time.  Nene: Y-You just stood there and watched? Why didn't you come up and say something sooner... Shuuji: Sorry, I was just a little confused, so I wound up staring. Are you out grocery shopping too? Nene: No, not quite. Today was pretty exhausting for me, so I was thinking of maybe going somewhere... Shuuji: Ah, yeah, I feel that. Sometimes you just don't wanna bother with whipping up something yourself.  Shuuji: ...Ramen? Nene: I told you not to look... Shuuji: S-Sorry. But really, I don't see anything to be embarrassed about.  Nene: You really don't think it's... strange or anything? You can't tell me a girl eating at a ramen restaurant all by herself doesn't weird you out.  Shuuji: Oh no, not at all. I don't see anything wrong with it. Nene: O-Oh, well thank you. Nene: It's not something I love, per se... but I've been curious to explore it.  Nene: Do you remember that day when you and I went with Inaba-san to the conveyor-belt sushi restaurant? Shuuji: Yeah, I do.  Nene: Well, it's much the same scenario... I've never actually been to a ramen restaurant before.  Shuuji: Is that so? Shuuji: You're getting cold feet?  Nene: That's right... I looked in and only saw men dining there, so I got scared.  Nene: But the thing is, I'm not sure I'll ever work up the courage to do this again if I walk away... Shuuji: Is trying this ramen that important to you?  Nene: ...Yes. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Umm... would you like me to come with you? Maybe that would help. Nene: Ah, er, wait... I thought you were going to be eating dinner at home.  Shuuji: Nah, it's all good. None of it'll get cold. Shuuji: And all this talk of ramen's gotten me a little curious... You wouldn't mind if I joined you, would you?  Shuuji: Absolutely. Ready to go on in? Nene: Yes! Shuuji: Coming.  Nene: Ramen! Oh, Ramen! Nene: It'll be my first time having real ramen instead of the cheap, instant kind. I can't wait to see how it tastes. Nene: Is that some sort of problem, perhaps?  Shuuji: Well, before we go in, let me check with you: are you aware of what kind of place this is?  Nene: Come again? I thought it was a ramen place. Is it not? Really? But I'm sure I― Shuuji: Weeell, you could SAY it's a ramen place, but that's not quite the full picture... Let's just say it's a bit of special place. Nene: Oh, you don't have to worry about that. I've done my research prior to coming here.  Shuuji: Really?  Nene: Yes. I have it all down pat. Shuuji: Yeah, a few times with Kaidou.  Shuuji: Ah, yes. Just us two.  Clerk: We got two free seats together, so come on and follow me.  Shuuji: Are you ready, Ayachi-san? Nene: Yes! Clerk: How's it goin', y'all! Shuuji: What are you getting? Nene: The extra large char siu. Shuuji: The extra large?  Nene: Am I not allowed to?  Shuuji: Well, you are, but it's gonna be a lot of food. You sure you can handle it?  Nene: Absolutely. It might seem surprising, but I'm actually a large eater.  Shuuji: Oh, really?  Shuuji: ...Are you sure about that? Nene: Huh? Clerk: Er, yeah, absolutely, miss... W-We'll have that out to ya.  Shuuji: A-Ayachi-san, what are you DOING?! Nene: What? Is something the matter?  Shuuji: A-Are you sure you want that? Like, are you REALLY sure you want that?  Nene: Well... is that not the special code that you chant when ordering it? I read on the internet that first-timers should simply stick to ordering it that way. Shuuji: Man oh man... You actually believed that... Nene: Now it's only a matter of time before it comes out and I get to eat it! Oh, I wonder what it'll taste like... I'm so excited♪ Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Yeah, we've already ordered and everything.  Nene: I feel a little bad. My apologies. But still, I'm glad our path's crossed.  Shuuji: Y-You are...? Nene: Absolutely. I've been eager to eat at this place for so, so long. Nene: Plus enjoying meals with others is something I seldom get the chance to do. It's always nice to have company.  Shuuji: O-Ohh... yeah. Shuuji: Yeah, I'm all good.  Shuuji: That exciting for you?  Nene: Oh, yes! I've had my eyes on this restaurant for so, sooo long. But I could never bring myself to come, you see. Nene: Just to put my frustration into perspective for you, if I had waited a tad bit longer, it might've been possible to retrieve fragments from me. Shuuji: Eh, I don't know, that sounds like a bit of an exaggeration.  Nene: I guarantee you it's not. I'm genuinely happy.   Nene: But, just so you know... If you don't want to stay here with me, you don't have to. You're free to leave anytime.  Shuuji: I don't mind. And if anything, I enjoy hanging out with you.  Nene: Huh...?! Umm, what did you― Shuuji: A-Ah, uhm! I just meant that, like, when I'm with you I don't have to worry about my secret, so it makes me feel relaxed, I guess? Or comfortable? Something like that.  Nene: Ah, yes, of course. Don't worry, I fully understand what you're trying to say.  Nene: And also, I enjoy hanging out with you too, Hoshina-kun.  Shuuji: ―――! Nene: ...... Nene: A-Also, I think I ought to thank you. You've really helped me out in a variety of ways.  Shuuji: Oh, no, I'm not looking for thanks. Really, I should be the one apologizing, considering you still haven't gotten back all your fragments.  Nene: No, that's perfectly alright. They are coming back, slowly but surely.  Nene: Ah! It's finally here♪ I finally get to taste real ramen♪ Shuuji: ...... Nene: Umm... What is this?  Shuuji: An extra large char siu ramen with noodles firm and spicy, extra veggies, and extra extra garlic oil. Nene: But, the thing is, I don't see the noodles. Where are they? Shuuji: Beneath that mountain of vegetables somewhere. Nene: ...This isn't ramen like I know it.  Shuuji: Well, this isn't regular ramen. It's the \"Taroumaru\" style of ramen.  Nene: Ramen... Nene: Ah, goodness! I can't mope around like this; That would be a definite breach of the sacred ramen etiquette! I have to start eating.  Shuuji: What?! Sacred ramen etiquette?! Nene: No. I was the one who ordered it, so I'll eat all of it. Well then, without further ado.  Shuuji: Well, at first, yeah. Oh, and you ate the vegetables. That's not part of the ramen.  Shuuji: True.  Shuuji: %130;HOW IN―?! Guest A: Yer frickin' kidding... That lass ate everything, even the soup... Guest B: And she's as slim as a twig?! Guest C: But boy is she a looker... Help, boys, I'm fallin' in love! Nene: D-Do you need something? You're staring at me, and it's making me rather embarrassed.  Nene: Is there something on my face, perhaps?  Shuuji: No, not that. I was just wondering, like... how does that slim body of yours even hold all that food... Guest A: Who IS that girl, seriously?! Guest B: Man, I don't even think I'd be able to eat all that.  Guest C: ...I wanna have an eating contest with her! Nene: ......? The other customers seem to be talking amongst themselves about something. Do you know why?  Shuuji: Probably. They just witnessed the birth of a new legend.  Nene: Huh... A legend, you say...? Nene: That and then some. It was simply delicious. But, ugh... I think I may have overeaten just a little bit.  Shuuji: Just a LITTLE...? Nene: My stomach's so full I might not be able to fit anything else in the rest of the day. It was very worthwhile coming here. Nene: And, of course, I have to thank you for accompanying me.  Shuuji: My pleasure.  Nene: Thanks to you, this won't be nagging at my chest anymore... I feel relieved. Guest B: And she ate so gracefully too... Damn, I'm a jealous man.  Guest C: I wanna challenge her to an eat-off.  Nene: I don't know why... but I feel like we're drawing a lot of attention.  Shuuji: Ah... yeah... Nene: Come on. Shuuji: I-I'm coming... Shuuji: What do you mean?  Nene: Well, so many people were staring at me... So I had the idea that maybe I'd done something disrespectful or rude.  Shuuji: No, you didn't do anything wrong. They were looking at you out of admiration. Nene: But for what reason? All I did was eat a bowl of ramen.  Shuuji: That was no ordinary bowl of ramen, though.  Nene: ......? I'm still somewhat confused, but it's good to know that they at least weren't angry at me, or sneering at me.   Shuuji: Oh, I forgot to ask. How's your stomach? Does it hurt any?  Nene: No, it feels quite fine. The only thing my chest is full of right now is joy and content *siigh*... Nene: What's wrong, Hoshina-kun? Shuuji: Ah, nothing. Glad to hear you liked it; I enjoyed mine too. It was a pretty fun time, all things considered.  Nene: I feel the same. Really, though... It feels like I have fun whatever I'm doing when you're there too.  Shuuji: Wh-Where'd that come from... Could you explain that a little more?  Nene: Well, we have many more members in the club now, and I got to go to the ramen place I've been longing to try. It's just been new experiences day after day... I enjoy my life a lot more.  Shuuji: R-Really? Nene: Yes. That's the honest truth.  Shuuji: Come to think of it, it's the same for me. I've made so many new experiences since joining the club. Hanging out with girls outside of school, participating in a school event, and so on and so forth.  Shuuji: My life would've been a million times duller if I hadn't made the decision to be more social and outgoing.  Nene: Huh? Oh, hardly. I haven't done anything quite that special.  Shuuji: Oh, but you have. Also, not as a repayment or anything, but if you ever feel scared to go someplace alone again... Just ask me, and I'll gladly come with you.  Nene: ...Er, umm... but... Nene: ...... Nene: Can I... hold you to that, then? Shuuji: Of course. Just hit me up whenever.  Nene: Thank you! Haha.  Shuuji: Of course, that's only if you don't mind me tagging along.  Nene: Why would I mind? Remember what I just told you? Every moment is fun when I'm with you.  Shuuji: O-Oh, uh, thanks. Shuuji: I'm in the same boat as you. Ever since I joined the OC, and became friends with you, I've been having so much fun. Nene: ―――! Nene: Th-Thank... you... Nene: Y-Yes. We ended club early today so I could go home and get rested up. It would be disrespectful to the rest of the club members if I stayed out late wandering around town.  Shuuji: Huh? Nene: Look, over there. That has to be her.  Shuuji: Oh, you're right. Shuuji: Yeah, better not disturb them if they're on a date.  Nene: Let's hurry and be on our way before she sees us.  Shuuji: That's the smartest idea, yeah.  Shuuji: Good to hear.  Nene: Make sure you get a good night's rest too, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Sure thing. Well, Ayachi-san, see you at school tomorrow. Goodnight.  Nene: Goodnight.  Nene: ...... Nene: Ack!!

Nene: It's not something I love, per se... but I've been curious to explore it.  Nene: Do you remember that day when you and I went with Inaba-san to the conveyor-belt sushi restaurant? Shuuji: Yeah, I do.  Nene: Well, it's much the same scenario... I've never actually been to a ramen restaurant before.  Shuuji: Is that so? Shuuji: You're getting cold feet?  Nene: That's right... I looked in and only saw men dining there, so I got scared.  Nene: But the thing is, I'm not sure I'll ever work up the courage to do this again if I walk away... Shuuji: Is trying this ramen that important to you?  Nene: ...Yes. Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Umm... would you like me to come with you? Maybe that would help. Nene: Ah, er, wait... I thought you were going to be eating dinner at home.  Shuuji: Nah, it's all good. None of it'll get cold. Shuuji: And all this talk of ramen's gotten me a little curious... You wouldn't mind if I joined you, would you?  Shuuji: Absolutely. Ready to go on in? Nene: Yes! Shuuji: Coming.  Nene: Ramen! Oh, Ramen! Nene: It'll be my first time having real ramen instead of the cheap, instant kind. I can't wait to see how it tastes. Nene: Is that some sort of problem, perhaps?  Shuuji: Well, before we go in, let me check with you: are you aware of what kind of place this is?  Nene: Come again? I thought it was a ramen place. Is it not? Really? But I'm sure I― Shuuji: Weeell, you could SAY it's a ramen place, but that's not quite the full picture... Let's just say it's a bit of special place. Nene: Oh, you don't have to worry about that. I've done my research prior to coming here.  Shuuji: Really?  Nene: Yes. I have it all down pat. Shuuji: Yeah, a few times with Kaidou.  Shuuji: Ah, yes. Just us two.  Clerk: We got two free seats together, so come on and follow me.  Shuuji: Are you ready, Ayachi-san? Nene: Yes! Clerk: How's it goin', y'all! Shuuji: What are you getting? Nene: The extra large char siu. Shuuji: The extra large?  Nene: Am I not allowed to?  Shuuji: Well, you are, but it's gonna be a lot of food. You sure you can handle it?  Nene: Absolutely. It might seem surprising, but I'm actually a large eater.  Shuuji: Oh, really?  Shuuji: ...Are you sure about that? Nene: Huh? Clerk: Er, yeah, absolutely, miss... W-We'll have that out to ya.  Shuuji: A-Ayachi-san, what are you DOING?! Nene: What? Is something the matter?  Shuuji: A-Are you sure you want that? Like, are you REALLY sure you want that?  Nene: Well... is that not the special code that you chant when ordering it? I read on the internet that first-timers should simply stick to ordering it that way. Shuuji: Man oh man... You actually believed that... Nene: Now it's only a matter of time before it comes out and I get to eat it! Oh, I wonder what it'll taste like... I'm so excited♪ Shuuji: ...... Shuuji: Yeah, we've already ordered and everything.  Nene: I feel a little bad. My apologies. But still, I'm glad our path's crossed.  Shuuji: Y-You are...? Nene: Absolutely. I've been eager to eat at this place for so, so long. Nene: Plus enjoying meals with others is something I seldom get the chance to do. It's always nice to have company.  Shuuji: O-Ohh... yeah. Shuuji: Yeah, I'm all good.  Shuuji: That exciting for you?  Nene: Oh, yes! I've had my eyes on this restaurant for so, sooo long. But I could never bring myself to come, you see. Nene: Just to put my frustration into perspective for you, if I had waited a tad bit longer, it might've been possible to retrieve fragments from me. Shuuji: Eh, I don't know, that sounds like a bit of an exaggeration.  Nene: I guarantee you it's not. I'm genuinely happy.   Nene: But, just so you know... If you don't want to stay here with me, you don't have to. You're free to leave anytime.  Shuuji: I don't mind. And if anything, I enjoy hanging out with you.  Nene: Huh...?! Umm, what did you― Shuuji: A-Ah, uhm! I just meant that, like, when I'm with you I don't have to worry about my secret, so it makes me feel relaxed, I guess? Or comfortable? Something like that.  Nene: Ah, yes, of course. Don't worry, I fully understand what you're trying to say.  Nene: And also, I enjoy hanging out with you too, Hoshina-kun.  Shuuji: ―――! Nene: ...... Nene: A-Also, I think I ought to thank you. You've really helped me out in a variety of ways.  Shuuji: Oh, no, I'm not looking for thanks. Really, I should be the one apologizing, considering you still haven't gotten back all your fragments.  Nene: No, that's perfectly alright. They are coming back, slowly but surely.  Nene: Ah! It's finally here♪ I finally get to taste real ramen♪ Shuuji: ...... Nene: Umm... What is this?  Shuuji: An extra large char siu ramen with noodles firm and spicy, extra veggies, and extra extra garlic oil. Nene: But, the thing is, I don't see the noodles. Where are they? Shuuji: Beneath that mountain of vegetables somewhere. Nene: ...This isn't ramen like I know it.  Shuuji: Well, this isn't regular ramen. It's the \"Taroumaru\" style of ramen.  Nene: Ramen... Nene: Ah, goodness! I can't mope around like this; That would be a definite breach of the sacred ramen etiquette! I have to start eating.  Shuuji: What?! Sacred ramen etiquette?! Nene: No. I was the one who ordered it, so I'll eat all of it. Well then, without further ado.  Shuuji: Well, at first, yeah. Oh, and you ate the vegetables. That's not part of the ramen.  Shuuji: True.  Shuuji: %130;HOW IN―?! Guest A: Yer frickin' kidding... That lass ate everything, even the soup... Guest B: And she's as slim as a twig?! Guest C: But boy is she a looker... Help, boys, I'm fallin' in love! Nene: D-Do you need something? You're staring at me, and it's making me rather embarrassed.  Nene: Is there something on my face, perhaps?  Shuuji: No, not that. I was just wondering, like... how does that slim body of yours even hold all that food... Guest A: Who IS that girl, seriously?! Guest B: Man, I don't even think I'd be able to eat all that.  Guest C: ...I wanna have an eating contest with her! Nene: ......? The other customers seem to be talking amongst themselves about something. Do you know why?  Shuuji: Probably. They just witnessed the birth of a new legend.  Nene: Huh... A legend, you say...? Nene: That and then some. It was simply delicious. But, ugh... I think I may have overeaten just a little bit.  Shuuji: Just a LITTLE...? Nene: My stomach's so full I might not be able to fit anything else in the rest of the day. It was very worthwhile coming here. Nene: And, of course, I have to thank you for accompanying me.  Shuuji: My pleasure.  Nene: Thanks to you, this won't be nagging at my chest anymore... I feel relieved. Guest B: And she ate so gracefully too... Damn, I'm a jealous man.  Guest C: I wanna challenge her to an eat-off.  Nene: I don't know why... but I feel like we're drawing a lot of attention.  Shuuji: Ah... yeah... Nene: Come on. Shuuji: I-I'm coming... Shuuji: What do you mean?  Nene: Well, so many people were staring at me... So I had the idea that maybe I'd done something disrespectful or rude.  Shuuji: No, you didn't do anything wrong. They were looking at you out of admiration. Nene: But for what reason? All I did was eat a bowl of ramen.  Shuuji: That was no ordinary bowl of ramen, though.  Nene: ......? I'm still somewhat confused, but it's good to know that they at least weren't angry at me, or sneering at me.   Shuuji: Oh, I forgot to ask. How's your stomach? Does it hurt any?  Nene: No, it feels quite fine. The only thing my chest is full of right now is joy and content *siigh*... Nene: What's wrong, Hoshina-kun? Shuuji: Ah, nothing. Glad to hear you liked it; I enjoyed mine too. It was a pretty fun time, all things considered.  Nene: I feel the same. Really, though... It feels like I have fun whatever I'm doing when you're there too.  Shuuji: Wh-Where'd that come from... Could you explain that a little more?  Nene: Well, we have many more members in the club now, and I got to go to the ramen place I've been longing to try. It's just been new experiences day after day... I enjoy my life a lot more.  Shuuji: R-Really? Nene: Yes. That's the honest truth.  Shuuji: Come to think of it, it's the same for me. I've made so many new experiences since joining the club. Hanging out with girls outside of school, participating in a school event, and so on and so forth.  Shuuji: My life would've been a million times duller if I hadn't made the decision to be more social and outgoing.  Nene: Huh? Oh, hardly. I haven't done anything quite that special.  Shuuji: Oh, but you have. Also, not as a repayment or anything, but if you ever feel scared to go someplace alone again... Just ask me, and I'll gladly come with you.  Nene: ...Er, umm... but... Nene: ...... Nene: Can I... hold you to that, then? Shuuji: Of course. Just hit me up whenever.  Nene: Thank you! Haha.  Shuuji: Of course, that's only if you don't mind me tagging along.  Nene: Why would I mind? Remember what I just told you? Every moment is fun when I'm with you.  Shuuji: O-Oh, uh, thanks. Shuuji: I'm in the same boat as you. Ever since I joined the OC, and became friends with you, I've been having so much fun. Nene: ―――! Nene: Th-Thank... you... Nene: Y-Yes. We ended club early today so I could go home and get rested up. It would be disrespectful to the rest of the club members if I stayed out late wandering around town.  Shuuji: Huh? Nene: Look, over there. That has to be her.  Shuuji: Oh, you're right. Shuuji: Yeah, better not disturb them if they're on a date.  Nene: Let's hurry and be on our way before she sees us.  Shuuji: That's the smartest idea, yeah.  Shuuji: Good to hear.  Nene: Make sure you get a good night's rest too, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Sure thing. Well, Ayachi-san, see you at school tomorrow. Goodnight.  Nene: Goodnight.  Nene: ...... Nene: Ack!!

You used to have the eyes of a dead fish, but now you've passed the point of a resurrected fish all the way to a bouncy, fresh fish. Shuuji: Er, sorry, but I have no idea what you're saying... Taichi: Ah! Something nice must've happened, huh? I see how it is. Maybe you're the fisherman, and you caught someone? You snagged a bouncy, fresh fish for yourself? Shuuji: No, I haven't! Could you stop teasing me first thing in the morning? That's messed― Shuuji: Oh... Give me a moment. I got a text. Shuuji: I've hardly ever used them before, so I don't have a clue what I'm doing― Taichi: Heh... *grin* Shuuji: Ah?! I-It's not like that, Dad! Taichi: Don't worry about me, Son. You meeting up with someone? Or are you having lunch together? Shuuji: Ugh... A-Anyway, I'm sorry but I gotta go now! I'll do the laundry after school, so just leave it be for now! Taichi: Sure. See you later. And good luck! Meguru: Ah! Senpai! Helloha! Shuuji: Pheew... G-Good morning. Meguru: You're breathing pretty heavily. Did you run all the way here? Shuuji: N-No, I didn't. Meguru: Ahaha... Yeah, I just felt like it when I woke up this morning. Meguru: And Senpai, what was up with that emoticon...? Pfft, that made it seem like you were all flustered. Shuuji: Oh, yeah... My bad, Inaba-san. I wanted to use one since you did, but I don't know jack about emoticons... Meguru: ...... Shuuji: H-Huh? Inaba-san? Meguru: *stare* Shuuji: Inaba―Ah! Shuuji: Sorry! Umm... Meguru. Meguru: That's right! I almost thought you forgot already. Meguru: But I'll forgive you since you remembered in the end. Let's go, Senpai! Shuuji: ...Huh? We're going this way again? Meguru: Of course. This way has just become that kinda way for us, you know? Shuuji: That kinda way...? You mean like, a way just for us, so we can talk? Meguru: Haha, actually saying that out loud is so lame. Shuuji: It's really hard to get what sets you off and what doesn't, you know that?! Meguru: I don't know what you're talking about. Meguru: ...Umm, by the way, Senpai. Shuuji: Huh? Wh-What's up? Meguru: You know, there's actually something I'd like to ask of you. That's partly why I texted you. Shuuji: Yeah? What is it? Meguru: You remember how I told you all that stuff on the way home last Friday? Shuuji: Ah... Shuuji: Huh? You mean... Meguru: Umm... From Nene-senpai and the others, I mean. Shuuji: Huh? Go on... Meguru: How do I put this... More importantly than that... Meguru: I just, well... I only want you to know. Shuuji: ...... Meguru: I'm not really sure why myself... Ahaha, yeah... Shuuji: ...Got it. I'll keep it to myself. Meguru: Ah... Shuuji: (I mean, even putting that aside...) Shuuji: (...Sorry, Meguru. I know I just promised you, but...) Shuuji: Yeah, thanks. Shuuji: Well, the thing is... Shuuji: (Do you two know anyone who could search for someone?) Shuuji: (Yeah. I'm trying find someone who went missing.) Nene: (...Is this somehow related to Inaba-san's fragments?) Tsumugi: (Oh, right. Ayachi-san told me about that. That's why you've been so concerned with Meguru-chan lately, right?) Shuuji: (Yeah... That's right.) Shuuji: (I'll give you the details later, but it seems like she her best friend disappeared and she doesn't know where she is.) Tsumugi: (...Really?) Shuuji: (She left without saying goodbye... I think the incident left her scarred. Now I want to find that friend of hers.) Tsumugi: (Oh... She went through all that?) Nene: (...Okay. I understand.) Nene: (I don't know anyone with people finding skills, but I'll at least ask who I can for now.) Tsumugi: (Oh, I'll help out too. Not just because of the fragments. I want to help Meguru-chan.) Shuuji: (Thanks. I really appreciate it.) Tsumugi: (Also, is it okay to tell Togakushi-senpai about this too? She knows a lot of people, so she could be really helpful.) Shuuji: (Yeah, would be great if you could. I can definitely see her being a big help.) Tsumugi: (I'm sure she will! Okay, I'll ask her.) Shuuji: (But one more thing. I would like you to keep this all from her for now.) Nene: (...Why is that?) Shuuji: (Umm... The truth is, she asked me to keep it a secret. Said she doesn't want anyone but me to know since it's embarrassing to her.) Tsumugi: (Oh?) Shuuji: (Besides, we might not be able to find the girl. I don't want to disappoint her or anything. So I'd really appreciate it if you kept quiet about this until we know more.) Nene: (...Alright. Understood.) Tsumugi: (But... Hey, Ayachi-san. This is definitely how I think it is, right?) Nene: (I think so. I can't see it any other way.) Shuuji: (...Huh? What're you talking about?) Tsumugi: (Ahaha, you can be so dense about this stuff.) Tsumugi: (Isn't it obvious? Meguru-chan actually―) Meguru: Excuse me! Tsumugi: Ah?! Meguru: Oh, you're all together! Meguru: Do you really have to ask? I came to hang out. Meguru: Alright! Don't mind me. Meguru: Hey, Nene-senpai, Tsumugi-senpai! I've come over to chat! Shuuji: ...... Tsumugi: H-Huh? With us, you mean? Meguru: You bet. We haven't seen each other or talked since Friday. Meguru: Oh, I'm not bothering you by coming, am I? Tsumugi: N-No! Not at all. Meguru: Ahaha, great! I'm happy to hear that. Nene: Is it okay to ignore Hoshina-kun like that, though? Shuuji: Huh? O-Oh, uh... Meguru: (...! ...!) Tsumugi: I'm pretty sure he didn't say anything... Meguru: Senpai, Senpai. You don't mind, do you? Shuuji: Nah, it's okay, Meguru. If you've come to see the two of them, then I'll let you guys be. Nene, Tsumugi: ...... Meguru: No one said you had to go away or anything. You can stay and watch in silence. Shuuji: Isn't this just bullying?! Meguru: Not at all! I'm just asking you to kindly watch over me. Shuuji: Ugh... Okay, enough with the puppy-dog eyes, Meguru. Meguru: What's the matter? Please watch over me, Senpai! Hideaki: Uh, excuse me. Comment from the peanut gallery, here. Meguru: Huh?! Wh-What the! Wh-Wh-What is it?! Hideaki: Okay, so... Ahem. Hideaki: Isn't Shuuji the only one you're chatting with?! Meguru: Ah... Wakana: Ah, sorry for butting in. I'm Kariya Wakana, and this guy is Kaidou Hideaki. We're Hoshina's friends. Meguru: O-Oh! I'm Inaba Meguru. Wakana: Anyway... Ahem. Wakana: Hoshina, since when have you been calling her by her first name without honorifics?! Shuuji: Ah... Tsumugi: Yes! That's right! I was just thinking that! Nice one, Kariya-san! Nene: So was I. I think we all were wondering about that. Up until now, he has been calling her by her last name with an honorific... Meguru: Ah, er, umm, about that, it's like...! Meguru: Huh? Ah, er... Shuuji: We've become pretty good friends, so I asked if I could start using her first name. Shuuji: And, well, a plain and simple \"Meguru\" without honorifics is what felt right to me, so I just went with that. Hideaki: Huh... I see. Gotta say, that's not like you. Shuuji: Yeah, you're not wrong. But I've never had a junior in a club before, so... Wakana: It didn't feel right treating her like an underclassman forever? Kinda like how they do it in sports clubs. Didn't know you had that side to you, Hoshina. Shuuji: Is there something wrong with that? It's not like this girl holds anything back like a typical underclassman. Wakana: Yeah, I can see that. She seems kinda over-familiar... Oh, sorry, I didn't mean that in a bad way. She just seems quite attached with how she's all \"Senpai, Senpai!\" Nene: So nothing special happened between you two that led to you calling her by her first name? Tsumugi: That's kind of a bummer... Shuuji: Y-Yeah, nothing special happened! Right, Meguru? Meguru: Huh?! D-Dat's right! Shuuji: Anyway, isn't it about time for you to head back to your classroom? Lunch break is almost over. Meguru: Ah... Oh yeah! I'll do that! Meguru: I-I'm leaving then! See you all later! Meguru: So I thought, next time I should have you come over to my place instead. Shuuji: I can't turn you down when you put it like that. Shuuji: Well, we're both ditching club for the day to do this... Meguru: But Nene-senpai said that it was okay. Shuuji: Yeah, I guess. Shuuji: (......) Shuuji: (I'm trying my best to ignore that delicious bittersweet taste from earlier.) Shuuji: Huh, you live pretty close to the station. Meguru: We could have passed through the shopping district to get to my place too, but I thought it'd be better to take a route that's easier to remember. Shuuji: ...Does that mean there is going to be a second time? Meguru: Why do you always have to ask these things out loud? Seriously, Senpai... Man. Shuuji: Wh-What's so bad about it? That's just how important it is. Meguru: O-Oh, it's important? Shuuji: Sure is. At least to me. Meguru: ...You don't ever change, do you? Shuuji: What's that supposed to mean? Meguru: Ah, we have to turn the corner here. Shuuji: Oh... Meguru: We're there. This is my house. Shuuji: Huh? Sure... Meguru: I'm baaack! Shuuji: It's about damn―Bueeh?! Shuuji: ...... Meguru: Senpai, you should see the look on your face right now. Shuuji: I mean, it didn't even cross my mind that you'd make me wait just to change again... Meguru: I like to kick back and relax at home, so I went ahead and changed into something more comfortable. Shuuji: Then why didn't you come to meet me in those clothes?!  Meguru: Because this way I get to surprise you. I knew you'd never expect me to change a second time. Shuuji: This was seriously all part of your plan? You sure went out of your way... Meguru: Really, though, this is loungewear. I can't wear this stuff outside. Meguru: So, what do you think? Surprised? Shuuji: Yeah, I really didn't expect you to change a second time. Though, your new getup is surprising too. You give off a completely different vibe than usual in that outfit. Meguru: That's right. Hehe. That surprise you too? Well, you had no way of knowing since I never told you. Meguru: Do the glasses make a big difference?  Shuuji: Hmm... They do make you look more plain than usual. Meguru: This is how I always looked before entering Himematsu. Shuuji: ...You mean, before your makeover? Meguru: Yep! Standing before you is an elusive Meguru that hardly anyone else gets to see. Meguru: It's gotten kinda embarrassing to show myself in public like this now. I look way too plain. I don't want to come off as a slob. Shuuji: ...But you're okay looking like this in front of me? Meguru: Hehehe. I'm making an exception for you. Your reactions are worth it! Meguru: I'd like you to keep this a secret as well. Shuuji: Y-Yeah, sure... Shuuji: That's a pretty sweet weapon, but I'm a lance player. Not like getting that gun would do me any good. Meguru: What the heck? Why aren't you jealous?! Meguru: Well, whatever. I know you'll think differently after Lavie here saves your butt with her shiny new weapon.  Shuuji: Guh. Well, yeah, I'm pretty much relying on you to carry me... as always... Shuuji: Gotta say, though. Playing with each other while sitting face-to-face is a completely different experience. Meguru: Right? This way you won't get horrifically murderized when you try to thank me! Shuuji: You didn't have to bring that up again, Lavie-san! Meguru: Sorry, but it was too funny. I don't think I'll ever forget how you just stopped and got your face kicked in. Shuuji: I was actually moved by how skilled yet kind the mysterious Lavie-san was... I was shocked when I saw who was behind the character. Meguru: What the heck? I'm not any different from Lavie! Just look at how good she is at coordinating her outfit. Shuuji: Can't deny that. That armor set is pretty dang cool. Meguru: I know, right?! I had to do so much grinding to get the whole set. Hehe! Shuuji: The hair and armor colors even match. It's kinda hot, or more like sexy... Nice job. Meguru: How could you say that to the person playing the character? Gross. Shuuji: I was just trying to compliment your fashion sense, since you seem to take pride in that... Meguru: Ugh... Meguru: Th-Then you should say that about me instead. Shuuji: Huh? Meguru: Don't \"huh\" me! What's with that answer? Don't you want to compliment me? Meguru: Lavie's player is, umm... confident about her own fashion as well... Shuuji: Oh, you look pretty sexy too. Meguru: Buh?! Wh-Wh-Wh-What're you saying?! Shuuji: Well, just look at how you're always showing off your legs... Meguru: M-M-Maybe, but... we're talking about my fashion sense! Not my legs! Shuuji: But going with bare legs is an intentional decision, isn't it? That's a conscious fashion choice. Meguru: Okay, true! But still! Ahh, geez! Shuuji: When I first saw you at school, I thought you looked like a bit of a floozy. But on closer inspection, it's really more of a casual cute style. Meguru: ...... Shuuji: I can tell you put some serious thought into picking a jumper that would match with your uniform. You give off a vibrant, playful vibe, like that of a younger girl. It's really fitting for you. Meguru: Y-Yeah? Ehehe, I spent a lot of time coordinating that outfit. It's my pride and joy♪ Meguru: Senpai, Senpai, praise me more! Shuuji: Sorry, but that's all I got. I'm having trouble remembering anything else to say from the fashion magazines I flipped through... Meguru: ...There goes most of the goodwill you just garnered. Shuuji: You're pretty easy to flatter, huh? Meguru: And there goes the rest. Shuuji: Sorry, I went a little too far there... Meguru: Whatever. Let's just go and do a quest. Shuuji: Oh, okay... I guess I'll back you up... Meguru: Pfft, haha... You don't have to act so depressed. Shuuji: Ah, you cheering up again? Meguru: Geez, I don't believe you. Yeah, I'll cheer up and shoot you full healing bullets～ Shuuji: Huh? Did you make these just for me...? Meguru: No, I made them yesterday. I was just in the mood for it. Shuuji: Ah... Still, though. Thanks. I'll dig right in. Meguru: Yeah, go ahead! Shuuji: ...Oh, this is great! It's sweet and sour, but also has a slightly bitter aftertaste. I really like it. Meguru: Oh, awesome! Meguru: Hearing everyone's impression is the best part of making any dessert. Shuuji: No, really, you're seriously good at this. Every treat of yours I've eaten has been delicious. Shuuji: You're a pretty good cook in general, aren't you? Like in MonHun, you've got quite a few hidden talents. Meguru: Oh, thank... Well, umm... Meguru: I guess you could say I'm a bit of a homebody. I tend to spend most of my free time at home. Shuuji: Oh, I see. That makes sense... Meguru: Yeah, basically. Shuuji: What kind of books do you like? The genres on your shelf seem all over the place. Meguru: Good question... I don't have specific preferences. I read pretty much everything. Shuuji: Huh... Got any examples? Meguru: The last thing I read was an Irish poem collection. Before that was some celebrity's street food travelogue, and before that an isekai harem light novel, I think? Shuuji: Holy crap, that spread... You'll read just about anything, huh? Meguru: Lately though I've been playing games a lot more than reading. I play stuff other than MonHun too. Shuuji: Yeah, I see the console. Oh... l-looks like you're into otome games. Meguru: Heck yeah. With headphones on! Those sexy male voices make my heart pound in ways that― Meguru: Wait, how did you know?! Shuuji: Err, there's what looks like one laying out in the open over there... Meguru: Huh?! Aaah! I-I forgot to put it awaaay! Shuuji: I-It's okay! I play that kinda stuff too! Meguru: What?! You're a guy who plays otome games?! Shuuji: No, I tend to play games aimed at guys... Meguru: For guys...? Y-You mean porn games? Ugh, you actually play that filth? You're the worst... Shuuji: What an absurd double standard. Don't just assume that any visual novel for guys is an adult PC game! There's a lot of perfectly normal stuff on consoles! Shuuji: Wait, why do you even know about those kinds of games...? Meguru: Uhh... Shuuji: You actually play those, don't you?! Meguru: I-I do not! How dare you suggest that?! I've had enough of your super-perv antics! Shuuji: Don't pretend like you're not accusing me of the same thing! This is such a double standard! Shuuji: No, thank you. For the tart, and― Meguru's Mom: Oh my, you're going home already? Meguru: Wha?! Shuuji: Oh, uh, yes! Thanks for having me! Meguru: M-Mom!! Why did you come out?! Meguru's Mom: This is the first friend you've brought over in so long. Of course I'd want to say hello! Meguru's Mom: And it's a boy too? How exciting! Meguru: Geez! I thought I told you to stay clear! Besides, you're getting the wrong idea! Meguru: It's not like you think! He's just an upperclassman from my club! Meguru's Mom: Thank you for taking care of my daughter. Ahh, I wish my husband was here to see you too... Meguru: Mooom! Geeez! Shuuji: Er, I really need to go now! You'll have to let me off for today! Thanks again! Shuuji: ...... Nene: Huh? Is that you, Hoshina-kun? Shuuji: Oh... Hey there, Ayachi-san. On your way home? Nene: Yes. The sun was setting, so we called it a day. Nene: Weren't you supposed to be somewhere with Inaba-san? Shuuji: Yeah, but we called it a day for the same reason. Nene: I see... Shuuji: Yeah... Nene: ...... Nene: I've got some news, Hoshina-kun. Shuuji: Ah... Wh-What is it? Nene: It seems that Togakushi-senpai is willing to help us. Shuuji: Huh? You mean... Nene: About Inaba-san's missing friend. Shuuji: ...... Nene: Since Inaba-san's friend was her classmate, Togakushi-senpai said she would get in touch with some people she knows from the schools near their old one and have them check the student registers there. Shuuji: I see... Nene: ...Hoshina-kun? Shuuji: Yeah... Meguru: \"I'd like you to keep this a secret as well.\" Shuuji: (But if there's a thorn still stuck in her heart, I want to remove it for her.) Shuuji: \"W-Well, yeah... We do...\" Meguru: \"So I feel a certain kinship with you.\" Shuuji: Are you free right now? This would be a good time for me to share the details. "

I'm supposed to call her by her first name now. Shuuji: Meguru... Meguru... Okay... Shuuji: The taste from... Meguru... Shuuji: Huh? D-Does it? Taichi: Yeah. You used to have the eyes of a dead fish, but now you've passed the point of a resurrected fish all the way to a bouncy, fresh fish. Shuuji: Er, sorry, but I have no idea what you're saying... Taichi: Ah! Something nice must've happened, huh? I see how it is. Maybe you're the fisherman, and you caught someone? You snagged a bouncy, fresh fish for yourself? Shuuji: No, I haven't! Could you stop teasing me first thing in the morning? That's messed― Shuuji: Oh... Give me a moment. I got a text. Shuuji: I've hardly ever used them before, so I don't have a clue what I'm doing― Taichi: Heh... *grin* Shuuji: Ah?! I-It's not like that, Dad! Taichi: Don't worry about me, Son. You meeting up with someone? Or are you having lunch together? Shuuji: Ugh... A-Anyway, I'm sorry but I gotta go now! I'll do the laundry after school, so just leave it be for now! Taichi: Sure. See you later. And good luck! Meguru: Ah! Senpai! Helloha! Shuuji: Pheew... G-Good morning. Meguru: You're breathing pretty heavily. Did you run all the way here? Shuuji: N-No, I didn't. Meguru: Ahaha... Yeah, I just felt like it when I woke up this morning. Meguru: And Senpai, what was up with that emoticon...? Pfft, that made it seem like you were all flustered. Shuuji: Oh, yeah... My bad, Inaba-san. I wanted to use one since you did, but I don't know jack about emoticons... Meguru: ...... Shuuji: H-Huh? Inaba-san? Meguru: *stare* Shuuji: Inaba―Ah! Shuuji: Sorry! Umm... Meguru. Meguru: That's right! I almost thought you forgot already. Meguru: But I'll forgive you since you remembered in the end. Let's go, Senpai! Shuuji: ...Huh? We're going this way again? Meguru: Of course. This way has just become that kinda way for us, you know? Shuuji: That kinda way...? You mean like, a way just for us, so we can talk? Meguru: Haha, actually saying that out loud is so lame. Shuuji: It's really hard to get what sets you off and what doesn't, you know that?! Meguru: I don't know what you're talking about. Meguru: ...Umm, by the way, Senpai. Shuuji: Huh? Wh-What's up? Meguru: You know, there's actually something I'd like to ask of you. That's partly why I texted you. Shuuji: Yeah? What is it? Meguru: You remember how I told you all that stuff on the way home last Friday? Shuuji: Ah... Shuuji: Huh? You mean... Meguru: Umm... From Nene-senpai and the others, I mean. Shuuji: Huh? Go on... Meguru: How do I put this... More importantly than that... Meguru: I just, well... I only want you to know. Shuuji: ...... Meguru: I'm not really sure why myself... Ahaha, yeah... Shuuji: ...Got it. I'll keep it to myself. Meguru: Ah... Shuuji: (I mean, even putting that aside...) Shuuji: (...Sorry, Meguru. I know I just promised you, but...) Shuuji: Yeah, thanks. Shuuji: Well, the thing is... Shuuji: (Do you two know anyone who could search for someone?) Shuuji: (Yeah. I'm trying find someone who went missing.) Nene: (...Is this somehow related to Inaba-san's fragments?) Tsumugi: (Oh, right. Ayachi-san told me about that. That's why you've been so concerned with Meguru-chan lately, right?) Shuuji: (Yeah... That's right.) Shuuji: (I'll give you the details later, but it seems like she her best friend disappeared and she doesn't know where she is.) Tsumugi: (...Really?) Shuuji: (She left without saying goodbye... I think the incident left her scarred. Now I want to find that friend of hers.) Tsumugi: (Oh... She went through all that?) Nene: (...Okay. I understand.) Nene: (I don't know anyone with people finding skills, but I'll at least ask who I can for now.) Tsumugi: (Oh, I'll help out too. Not just because of the fragments. I want to help Meguru-chan.) Shuuji: (Thanks. I really appreciate it.) Tsumugi: (Also, is it okay to tell Togakushi-senpai about this too? She knows a lot of people, so she could be really helpful.) Shuuji: (Yeah, would be great if you could. I can definitely see her being a big help.) Tsumugi: (I'm sure she will! Okay, I'll ask her.) Shuuji: (But one more thing. I would like you to keep this all from her for now.) Nene: (...Why is that?) Shuuji: (Umm... The truth is, she asked me to keep it a secret. Said she doesn't want anyone but me to know since it's embarrassing to her.) Tsumugi: (Oh?) Shuuji: (Besides, we might not be able to find the girl. I don't want to disappoint her or anything. So I'd really appreciate it if you kept quiet about this until we know more.) Nene: (...Alright. Understood.) Tsumugi: (But... Hey, Ayachi-san. This is definitely how I think it is, right?) Nene: (I think so. I can't see it any other way.) Shuuji: (...Huh? What're you talking about?) Tsumugi: (Ahaha, you can be so dense about this stuff.) Tsumugi: (Isn't it obvious? Meguru-chan actually―) Meguru: Excuse me! Tsumugi: Ah?! Meguru: Oh, you're all together! Meguru: Do you really have to ask? I came to hang out. Meguru: Alright! Don't mind me. Meguru: Hey, Nene-senpai, Tsumugi-senpai! I've come over to chat! Shuuji: ...... Tsumugi: H-Huh? With us, you mean? Meguru: You bet. We haven't seen each other or talked since Friday. Meguru: Oh, I'm not bothering you by coming, am I? Tsumugi: N-No! Not at all. Meguru: Ahaha, great! I'm happy to hear that. Nene: Is it okay to ignore Hoshina-kun like that, though? Shuuji: Huh? O-Oh, uh... Meguru: (...! ...!) Tsumugi: I'm pretty sure he didn't say anything... Meguru: Senpai, Senpai. You don't mind, do you? Shuuji: Nah, it's okay, Meguru. If you've come to see the two of them, then I'll let you guys be. Nene, Tsumugi: ...... Meguru: No one said you had to go away or anything. You can stay and watch in silence. Shuuji: Isn't this just bullying?! Meguru: Not at all! I'm just asking you to kindly watch over me. Shuuji: Ugh... Okay, enough with the puppy-dog eyes, Meguru. Meguru: What's the matter? Please watch over me, Senpai! Hideaki: Uh, excuse me. Comment from the peanut gallery, here. Meguru: Huh?! Wh-What the! Wh-Wh-What is it?! Hideaki: Okay, so... Ahem. Hideaki: Isn't Shuuji the only one you're chatting with?! Meguru: Ah... Wakana: Ah, sorry for butting in. I'm Kariya Wakana, and this guy is Kaidou Hideaki. We're Hoshina's friends. Meguru: O-Oh! I'm Inaba Meguru. Wakana: Anyway... Ahem. Wakana: Hoshina, since when have you been calling her by her first name without honorifics?! Shuuji: Ah... Tsumugi: Yes! That's right! I was just thinking that! Nice one, Kariya-san! Nene: So was I. I think we all were wondering about that. Up until now, he has been calling her by her last name with an honorific... Meguru: Ah, er, umm, about that, it's like...! Meguru: Huh? Ah, er... Shuuji: We've become pretty good friends, so I asked if I could start using her first name. Shuuji: And, well, a plain and simple \"Meguru\" without honorifics is what felt right to me, so I just went with that. Hideaki: Huh... I see. Gotta say, that's not like you. Shuuji: Yeah, you're not wrong. But I've never had a junior in a club before, so... Wakana: It didn't feel right treating her like an underclassman forever? Kinda like how they do it in sports clubs. Didn't know you had that side to you, Hoshina. Shuuji: Is there something wrong with that? It's not like this girl holds anything back like a typical underclassman. Wakana: Yeah, I can see that. She seems kinda over-familiar... Oh, sorry, I didn't mean that in a bad way. She just seems quite attached with how she's all \"Senpai, Senpai!\" Nene: So nothing special happened between you two that led to you calling her by her first name? Tsumugi: That's kind of a bummer... Shuuji: Y-Yeah, nothing special happened! Right, Meguru? Meguru: Huh?! D-Dat's right! Shuuji: Anyway, isn't it about time for you to head back to your classroom? Lunch break is almost over. Meguru: Ah... Oh yeah! I'll do that! Meguru: I-I'm leaving then! See you all later! Meguru: So I thought, next time I should have you come over to my place instead. Shuuji: I can't turn you down when you put it like that. Shuuji: Well, we're both ditching club for the day to do this... Meguru: But Nene-senpai said that it was okay. Shuuji: Yeah, I guess. Shuuji: (......) Shuuji: (I'm trying my best to ignore that delicious bittersweet taste from earlier.) Shuuji: Huh, you live pretty close to the station. Meguru: We could have passed through the shopping district to get to my place too, but I thought it'd be better to take a route that's easier to remember. Shuuji: ...Does that mean there is going to be a second time? Meguru: Why do you always have to ask these things out loud? Seriously, Senpai... Man. Shuuji: Wh-What's so bad about it? That's just how important it is. Meguru: O-Oh, it's important? Shuuji: Sure is. At least to me. Meguru: ...You don't ever change, do you? Shuuji: What's that supposed to mean? Meguru: Ah, we have to turn the corner here. Shuuji: Oh... Meguru: We're there. This is my house. Shuuji: Huh? Sure... Meguru: I'm baaack! Shuuji: It's about damn―Bueeh?! Shuuji: ...... Meguru: Senpai, you should see the look on your face right now. Shuuji: I mean, it didn't even cross my mind that you'd make me wait just to change again... Meguru: I like to kick back and relax at home, so I went ahead and changed into something more comfortable. Shuuji: Then why didn't you come to meet me in those clothes?!  Meguru: Because this way I get to surprise you. I knew you'd never expect me to change a second time. Shuuji: This was seriously all part of your plan? You sure went out of your way... Meguru: Really, though, this is loungewear. I can't wear this stuff outside. Meguru: So, what do you think? Surprised? Shuuji: Yeah, I really didn't expect you to change a second time. Though, your new getup is surprising too. You give off a completely different vibe than usual in that outfit. Meguru: That's right. Hehe. That surprise you too? Well, you had no way of knowing since I never told you. Meguru: Do the glasses make a big difference?  Shuuji: Hmm... They do make you look more plain than usual. Meguru: This is how I always looked before entering Himematsu. Shuuji: ...You mean, before your makeover? Meguru: Yep! Standing before you is an elusive Meguru that hardly anyone else gets to see. Meguru: It's gotten kinda embarrassing to show myself in public like this now. I look way too plain. I don't want to come off as a slob. Shuuji: ...But you're okay looking like this in front of me? Meguru: Hehehe. I'm making an exception for you. Your reactions are worth it! Meguru: I'd like you to keep this a secret as well. Shuuji: Y-Yeah, sure... Shuuji: That's a pretty sweet weapon, but I'm a lance player. Not like getting that gun would do me any good. Meguru: What the heck? Why aren't you jealous?! Meguru: Well, whatever. I know you'll think differently after Lavie here saves your butt with her shiny new weapon.  Shuuji: Guh. Well, yeah, I'm pretty much relying on you to carry me... as always... Shuuji: Gotta say, though. Playing with each other while sitting face-to-face is a completely different experience. Meguru: Right? This way you won't get horrifically murderized when you try to thank me! Shuuji: You didn't have to bring that up again, Lavie-san! Meguru: Sorry, but it was too funny. I don't think I'll ever forget how you just stopped and got your face kicked in. Shuuji: I was actually moved by how skilled yet kind the mysterious Lavie-san was... I was shocked when I saw who was behind the character. Meguru: What the heck? I'm not any different from Lavie! Just look at how good she is at coordinating her outfit. Shuuji: Can't deny that. That armor set is pretty dang cool. Meguru: I know, right?! I had to do so much grinding to get the whole set. Hehe! Shuuji: The hair and armor colors even match. It's kinda hot, or more like sexy... Nice job. Meguru: How could you say that to the person playing the character? Gross. Shuuji: I was just trying to compliment your fashion sense, since you seem to take pride in that... Meguru: Ugh... Meguru: Th-Then you should say that about me instead. Shuuji: Huh? Meguru: Don't \"huh\" me! What's with that answer? Don't you want to compliment me? Meguru: Lavie's player is, umm... confident about her own fashion as well... Shuuji: Oh, you look pretty sexy too. Meguru: Buh?! Wh-Wh-Wh-What're you saying?! Shuuji: Well, just look at how you're always showing off your legs... Meguru: M-M-Maybe, but... we're talking about my fashion sense! Not my legs! Shuuji: But going with bare legs is an intentional decision, isn't it? That's a conscious fashion choice. Meguru: Okay, true! But still! Ahh, geez! Shuuji: When I first saw you at school, I thought you looked like a bit of a floozy. But on closer inspection, it's really more of a casual cute style. Meguru: ...... Shuuji: I can tell you put some serious thought into picking a jumper that would match with your uniform. You give off a vibrant, playful vibe, like that of a younger girl. It's really fitting for you. Meguru: Y-Yeah? Ehehe, I spent a lot of time coordinating that outfit. It's my pride and joy♪ Meguru: Senpai, Senpai, praise me more! Shuuji: Sorry, but that's all I got. I'm having trouble remembering anything else to say from the fashion magazines I flipped through... Meguru: ...There goes most of the goodwill you just garnered. Shuuji: You're pretty easy to flatter, huh? Meguru: And there goes the rest. Shuuji: Sorry, I went a little too far there... Meguru: Whatever. Let's just go and do a quest. Shuuji: Oh, okay... I guess I'll back you up... Meguru: Pfft, haha... You don't have to act so depressed. Shuuji: Ah, you cheering up again? Meguru: Geez, I don't believe you. Yeah, I'll cheer up and shoot you full healing bullets～ Shuuji: Huh? Did you make these just for me...? Meguru: No, I made them yesterday. I was just in the mood for it. Shuuji: Ah... Still, though. Thanks. I'll dig right in. Meguru: Yeah, go ahead! Shuuji: ...Oh, this is great! It's sweet and sour, but also has a slightly bitter aftertaste. I really like it. Meguru: Oh, awesome! Meguru: Hearing everyone's impression is the best part of making any dessert. Shuuji: No, really, you're seriously good at this. Every treat of yours I've eaten has been delicious. Shuuji: You're a pretty good cook in general, aren't you? Like in MonHun, you've got quite a few hidden talents. Meguru: Oh, thank... Well, umm... Meguru: I guess you could say I'm a bit of a homebody. I tend to spend most of my free time at home. Shuuji: Oh, I see. That makes sense... Meguru: Yeah, basically. Shuuji: What kind of books do you like? The genres on your shelf seem all over the place. Meguru: Good question... I don't have specific preferences. I read pretty much everything. Shuuji: Huh... Got any examples? Meguru: The last thing I read was an Irish poem collection. Before that was some celebrity's street food travelogue, and before that an isekai harem light novel, I think? Shuuji: Holy crap, that spread... You'll read just about anything, huh? Meguru: Lately though I've been playing games a lot more than reading. I play stuff other than MonHun too. Shuuji: Yeah, I see the console. Oh... l-looks like you're into otome games. Meguru: Heck yeah. With headphones on!
